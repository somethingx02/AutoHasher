4 Came across this office by chance.  I had a appointment with another pediatrician in Summerlin but due to their mistake.  We showed up, waited 30 minutes and was told we didn't have an appointment.    Called this office and they had an opening, and I had to make it here by 30 minutes.  My son was 6 weeks premature and this was his 1st doctor visit.  So I wanted to make sure he saw a doctor.   Dr Ryon Parker is great!  I cant' say enough great things about him.  He is patient, takes his time, notices details about my son and explains things to us so we could understand.  He understands the worries of being a parent and I HIGHLY recommend him if you are looking for a pediatrician.  My sister joins me when I take my son to his doctor visits.  And she always comments on how she really likes Dr Parker and even though at times there is an hour wait, with an appointment, he is worth waiting to see.    The only thing I don't like about this office is that they see adult patients at well.  Just wish it was strictly a pediatricians office.  Also, they had my son listed as "female".  Office staff didn't even notice the mistake, but I later notice after receiving calls from the office wondering why they always referred to my son as "she".  But I emailed Dr Parker, he quickly apologized and made sure it was corrected.    Love Dr Parker as my pediatrician!  Thank you Dr Parker!  You are the best and my family thinks so too!!!
1 Terrible. Judged me for saying I don't want children. Told me I need std tests due to my age in a condescending tone. And now I have received a bill in the mail for the 15 minute talk, she didn't give a pap or do blood, just scheduled them out and the office staff was so rude they didn't even tell me where to go to get blood done. I went somewhere else. Fuck this place. If you go after reading this you're making a badddddd choice!!!   Ps. I got a bill for getting my weight measured, blood pressure taken and a 10 minute talk with the doctor for $300. Also the bill has a pizza grease mark on it, wtf?
5 We have been looking for a family doctor for quite sometime now. We found this great office with a nice staff and knowledgable doctors.  We highly recommend
5 A year ago I was having horrible back pain!  Dr Greg quickly put me on a plan to get me feeling better!   Simply amazing.  Dr Greg is awesome and cares about his patients!  I also have had massages from Audrey...oh so great!!!
3 The physical therapy staff is good,  but the girl at the check in desk, Janelle T, is horrible.  They were so booked they could not schedule an appointment for an entire week.  They said to keep checking back for cancelations. I was in the waiting room,  and heard a person cancel for that very week that there were no openings.  I went up and asked if there were any cancelations for that week, and she just straight up lies and says no.  Plus,  she didn't even check the computer.
1 I'm not one to write a review. However, I feel like this place deserves one. I am a fairly new patient here and I have to say I'm completely disappointed. Customer service is horrible from the time you walk in to the time you leave. The most disorganized Clinic I've been too. You get called up by a number not even bother saying your name. I was kept waiting in a small hallway before I was even given a room. Not good.  Waited over an hour to be seen. When I finally go the chance to see the doctor I felt like he was in such a rush not really paid attention to my reason for office visit. I needed to come back because he had ordered blood work. When I saw the doctor again he looked completely clueless. He treated me as of I had never been here before did not know my reason for visit again!! Basically just read off the computer things I already knew. I had to tell the doctor what he had prescribed me last time I was here because he did not know! Really he's the one who have it to me. There's so much to say, but really?? This place is horrible! I basically had to beg for my lab results to be given to me. 3 different people had to walk in the room to go over my results so not professional. Just gave to say I will never be back here again.
5 The staff is updated and great. Like I said before I love this doctor! Things have been wonderful the last few months.
5 Very knowledgeable doctors and great clinic and staff. They listen to you carefully, consider all the possibilities and provide the best care. You'll sense the quality of care you get yourself after the first visit.
5 Suzi is such a blessing!  Very skilled in using her gifts.  I have scoliosis and have chronic back and neck issues.  I am so grateful that I have found someone who can help.  I will definitely recommend her to my clients.  Thank you Suzi!
1 The office manager is a total nightmare. She is the most rude person we have ever met and the Dr. Jones does not care enough that she is running off the patients. Also all he cares about is selling his HCG shots, not about the over all health of his patients. I had to wait 5 weeks to get an appointment after being released from the hospital. They are one of the worst practices i have even seen.
5 Dr. Scharf is an awesome chiropractor and totally works well with all of his clients. A very different kind of office than other co called chiropractors. Breinn is awesome to work with as well along with their Massage Therapist. Get a deep tissue there. You won't be sorry!
5 Dr Schneider is the best doctor I've ever had. I'm picky and ask lots of questions but this guy is the best. I've told him he's forbidden from retiring because I've never had a doctor I've liked this much!
5 Can this place get any friendlier?? Love everyone here from the techs to the physical therapists! Megan is amazing and great with my son! She is so patient with him, he loves her and after only a few visits she has dramatically reduced his pain. Thank you guys so much!
4 I came here after I was offered a complimentary massage to discover the new health and wellness clinic in Thornhill. I am so glad I came here for my complementary massage. The clinic is really clean and the massage therapist did a really good job. After my 30 minute massage I asked if I could book another 30 minute appointment right then and there so I could get a full body massage. Unfortunately, they were booked solid for the day and were unable to do so.   I would definitely go back to this clinic. They also offer chiropractic treatment and some other services. They are highly professional and I would definitely go back.
5 Called for a new patient sick visit yesterday and they squeezed me right in that day. Office is clean and very comfortable. Office staff was extremely pleasant and the man at the front desk was so kind and seemed like he really loves his job and interacting with the patients. I highly recommend this PCP practice!
5 Sweet baby biscuits!   This woman is amazing.  I REALLY needed a massage and she delivered exactly what I needed, and included hot stones!  1. She is an amazing massage therapist. She didn't just apply lotion to my back. I wanted pressure and I got pressure, but not too much.  She is truly talented and a hard worker.   2.  She is very kind and friendly. Her personality is legit!  I came in to relax, and the massage was not awkward by any means. She made me feel at home.   3. She is incredibly knowledgable. She educated me on the importance of hydration.   4.  She is a massage therapist NOT a salesperson. No pressure (minus the pressure on my back).  5. Incredibly fair prices.   Oh, and she even offered me a stick of gum at the end. PERFECT!  If it were possible to bring her with me to LA I would. If you are in Las Vegas/Clark County and need a massage, check her out.  I promise you won't be disappointed.
5 Foothills is, by far, the best physical therapy facility in the valley! Allow me to tell you why.   First, I need to state that I had severely sprained my knee. I was walking with a cane. My mobility and livelihood were significantly compromised by my injury.  After the first day of PT, I had regained some flexibility. This is only after ONE session! Every day that I left, I was stronger than when I walked in. Carlos and the rest of the staff are certainly masters of their craft. Their collective knowledge of how the body works made for efficient and effective visits.   Now for the ingredient that sets this place apart...you are treated like a friend from the moment you walk in. Not once was I "the knee injury". I was always Tina first, knee injury second. The admin staff will greet you by name and ask you how your day is going. All the techs are super friendly and outgoing. The therapists will have conversations with you and get to know you as a person. EVERYONE is supportive, encouraging and dedicated to your results and progress.   It's been six weeks since my last session and I have not had any type of relapses. My knee is strong and capable. I'm able to resume the life I had before my injury. For that, I give full credit to Foothills!
4 I've been here twice - the staff is always friendly, and usually in and out in less than two hours. I wouldn't get the prescriptions filled there however, they are pretty pricey. 15$ for one bottle of amoxicillin
5 Dr. Sharma is the best doctor I have ever seen. I found him several years ago on Yelp, and it's past time for me to review his office. Health issues are emotionally draining, but having such a good primary care doctor makes it easier. Dr. Sharma is incredibly compassionate and has always taken time to listen to my concerns. I have never had another medical professional as invested in my overall health. He is thorough, no matter the issue, and recommended me to other outstanding specialists when I had some pretty urgent health concerns. I didn't know so many great doctors even existed in Vegas! His staff is welcoming and kind, and they have always gotten me in the day I called for an appointment. I'm so sad he doesn't take my new insurance, but I highly, highly recommend him to all my family and friends.
5 Well-run and personable practice. All staff are efficient and courteous. I always feel cared for here and never rushed. Highly recommended.
1 I have been suffering from a pinched nerve in my neck and could not get relief at home with my current regiment. At the advice of an on call doctor I arrived at St. Luke's. The check in and triage were stellar and very fast. There was no wait and I was taken straight back. After the exam with a very nice doctor I could hear the banter of the nurses out at the station. Several F- bombs and other " un@ professional talk was underway. I was ordered a couple of IM shots to help ease the pain. When the nurse arrived she was so jittery and shaky trying to draw the needle. My concern was she was about to come at me with her shaky and very unsteady hand. After she gave me the shot I was so nervous because of her unsteady hand and then. I'm still hearing the weird non work appropriate conversation. I just left... I was starting to get a panic attack for the way the nurse was acting. She told me " sorry for the shaking I just took my adderall".... what?!?! It makes you shake that way?! As I was walking outside I realized that I could not escape the clutches of this place as all their doors require a code to open. This is a fire hazard right? Either way based on my experience I would not go back Or even recommend them.
5 I want to express my gratitude to Dr. Mitch and his staff. I went in with extreme neck pain. I've had this issue in the past and the other chiropractors I went to just didn't help.  I will recommend Dr. Mitch and his wonderful staff to everyone I know.  Thank you so much!
5 Just moved to the area and feel very grateful to have found Arrowhead Health Center in Scottsdale. The personal attention and care I received was outstanding!
1 My doctor now has to be the WORST doctors office. You will wait 2 hours to be seen then another 2 hours waiting in the room. I went with a 104.7 temp sick as ever. I waited for 3 hours to be seen. After 3 hours I asked the nurse and she said " we were gonna send you to the ER but we decided not to" WHAT????? So you just leave me in here to die! I've been feeling sick for a few days and someone said to go to Banner on alma school. Best choice I've ever made. They really cared if I was ok. I was only there for 45 mins. I will never go to my doctor now again.
5 Make Total Lifestyle Chiropractic your go-to for whole health and chiropractic in the valley. In my experience, I am always treated with patience and full attention during appointments, Dr Chris and Dr Sonya, two people who care about your case and follow up, and most importantly - the docs are incredibly knowledgeable in their profession. You're in good hands with Total Lifestyle Chiropractic.
2 The DOCTORS are excellent, it's too bad that the lack of professionalism in the front office drags down the entire practice. They don't even acknowledge you sitting there waiting forever. This location schedules you for an appointment--why bother? I never get in anywhere near the time of that appointment, even if I arrive early!! And, like another reviewer has stated, the medication refills situation is ridiculous. I have to call the doctor personally on her cell to get any action there. The buckeye location is much better run (pardon the grammar), never an hour wait in the lobby there. Just a bit (ok, a lot) of a drive for the better front office experience. If I didn't absolutely love my doctor here, I would find a new practice.  The DOCTOR herself gets 5 stars (10 stars?) She is not one of those doctors who slots 5 minutes per patient, she listens to all your concerns. She doesn't act like she knows it all because she went to med school & you didn't.  Predictably, someone will say that her willingness to listen and take the time with patients is the reason for the wait times...EXCEPT that the Buckeye office doesn't have those wait times, and I see the same doctor there (when I can justify the drive). So that excuse just doesn't hold merit. Bottom line: great doctors, horrible front office staff.
5 These people are great. Very caring. PA Kurt is really nice listens and wants to help his patients.
5 I found this place while in town for work.  I had recently been in car accident and was having many ailments, so found this place that happened to open passed 630.    From her initial assessment, The therapist was very in tuned to what my body was needing.   I am very aware that one session will not heal a body but She definitely put me back on the path to recovery.   I left feeling 1000 times better than I walked in and made a follow up appointment for two days later.  If one is a skeptic about massage therapy,  this place will erase any doubts.
1 Went in to get my sons immunization records printed and it took 2 hours to get a room and then the person that had access to the records wasn't here. What a waste of time. Never coming back.
5 I have been a patient at this clinic for a long time. The staff and the doctors are the best. I had problems with my neck and back. The chiropractor relieved my pain and helped me gain strength and flexibility again. The acupuncturist helped me with my sleep problems. I get massages all the time to help release tension. The location is great. The staff are amazing.
1 Went in because I had a horrible sore throat and could barely swallow.  Saw Dr. Elston.  Asked him if I could have anything to help my throat feel better so I could sleep at night- like some cough syrup or something.  Told me I just had to wait it out.  So- spent money and waited there for nothing.  Spent last night waking up every 30 min because I was in so much pain.  Still feeling miserable.  Downed an entire package of throat lozenges and throat spray.  Now I'm going to have to spend even more money to go somewhere else to get something to help me to feel better.
5 need therapy on knee they do a great job workers very nice and help full well trained listen to you my knee is getting better great place worth going there if you need therapy
1 If I could give this place a 0 I would. we took my Aunt that was visiting from Mexico last weekend. We arrived and the lady was rude because it was half an hour to closing time. My aunt was feeling horrible so I filled out the registration papers quickly. When i took them to the receptionist she said she needed an ID. We didnt have one at the moment but I offered mine while someone went home and got my aunts. She said no in a really rude way. I explained that my aunt needed help fast that we could get the Id in 10 min tops but she refused. They dont care about the patients health! Specially if it's 8:30 pm on a saturday night! What got me even more upset was the attitude and rudeness that the receptionist had. They are ways to speak to patients! Horrible staff. I DONT RECOMMEND IT AND IM NEVER GOING BACK.
3 Honestly,  the facility is clean and the care is good. The front desk staff is not friendly AT ALL. No hello, nothing. They act as if you're bothering them when they buzz you in.  The nurses and aids that my mom has are very good, caring and compassionate but the nurse at the desk will not address you unless you speak to her! I wanted to ask a question and thought she was working on something so I waited.  I was standing RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER and after about 7 minutes I said excuse me to which she let out a heavy sigh and said "uh huh" but never looked up. They need a course in how to deal with the families. Very rude. But the nurses on the floor that actually do patient care and the aids, hands on, they're amazing!  The physical therapists and occupational therapists are wonderful. Very caring and encouraging. They're aware of dropping blood pressures, blood sugars and other problems that might effect the patient's performance. Overall this facility is good but those people when you first enter need work along with the nurse at the station on the 2nd floor. Perhaps a vacation is needed.
5 Thank you, Brendan!  I'm not all the way better (thank you insurance limits), but he has put me (and my bum foot) on the road to recovery.
5 Everything about this place is incredible, from the amazing staff to the beautiful ambiance. I felt welcome and cozy immediately upon walking in. Dr. Mall's professionalism and expertise made me feel not only confident, but excited about my decision to get work done for my first time.  I went in about a month ago because I had dark circles form under my eyes that come with age and stress. Dr. Mall did Voluma fillers for my tear troughs and under eyes, and the difference is UNBELIEVABLE. I'm so satisfied with the results. I feel confident wearing no makeup and I look younger. It's had such a positive impact on my day to day. I could not be more grateful to Dr. Mall and every one of his staff members.  I also went back for the Titan XL laser treatment with Michelle today and I'm absolutely loving the results of those as well! It enhances the amazing job Dr. Mall did with the Voluma even more!!! Michelle was also incredible, my treatment with her was so relaxing and rejuvenating. I didn't bother putting on makeup all the rest of the day, I felt so beautiful!  I can't wait to go see everyone at Dr. Mall's again. I just love it there! I would HIGHLY recommend for anyone to go see him. I fully and happily put my trust in everyone there.
5 I put 100% of my trust in Sameera Shaih, MD. She is a Knowledgeable, Caring, Excellent MD that I see for treatment regularly.
1 I can give them at least one star because the front office was friendly. Knowledge is key when working with injuries, and this place didn't have it.
5 This is unlike any medical clinic you have ever been to. The atmosphere when you walk in the door is calm and inviting, a cross between a cafe and a spa. The staff and medical team really take the time to get to know everything about you -- I spent an hour talking to (not waiting for!) my health care team. I never felt rushed and totally enjoyed my visit. They focus on prevention and keeping you well and offer all kinds of cool classes to do that. I was at a loss for finding good primary care since moving to Vegas and had an unpleasant experience with a doc who had been rated highly on another website. SO glad Turntable Health opened!
2 I've been going to this office since 2013 when I fractured three of my vertebrae in my back when I was 17 years old. I have seen Dr. Maduka and some of the physician assistants. I think the providers are pretty good at what they do, and by far I think Dr. Maduka is extremely professional, very thorough in his work, and a very trustworthy doctor. He has helped me so much with all of my pain problems. The reason I am rating this facility 2 stars is because of the office staff. I had blood work drawn last Thursday, I requested the results multiple times and was told I'm not able to receive them unless I sign a release form. So today, I went into the office to do so. Mercedes at the urgent care front desk was extremely rude and unprofessional. She told me she would not even so much as show me my results. When I reminded her that it is illegal to refuse to show me my lab results, she started looking around and said she lost them and that there is nothing she can do. I told her I came here on my lunch break from work, and that on the phone she said they were urgent so I need to see them today. She said she didn't care because she can't find them anyways. I said okay, and had my other doctor call and speak to the office manager and explain that I was going to file a HIPAA complaint because of what happened. Now they're saying I can come in today before they close to get my results. So unprofessional and annoying.
4 Dr Ruddell cares about his patients. His office staff is friendly and I would say his services are a great value.
5 Aris Physical Therapy is as professional and efficient as it gets. At age 71 I have a diagnosis of advanced arthritis in my left hip. My doctor told me that the only reason that I have good pain management and not overdue for a hip replacement is because I have done serious resistance training in the gym for the past 14 years. The muscles and tendons around the hip joint are strong. Al and his team at Aris are working with me to increase range of motion and fine tune my lifting techniques to keep keep things strong to avoid surgery in the future. The sessions are 90 minutes and they are teaching me stretching and additional exercises that will help keep me pain free without drugs or surgery. Al is an athlete himself, knows his way around a gym and understands the exercises that I do and have available in the gym.
4 I don't know why there are so many bad reviews! Came in Saturday night 930 from horrible flu and asthma issues. Got out at 11pm, I love the doctor I saw! They got me in and out :) thanks concentra!!
5 The Staff is very friendly and professional. I just started going and have already notice the stiffness in my lower back is loosening up. I feel more range of motion when I'm playing golf. They even give me exercises to do at home, that help with loosening my back, neck and shoulders. I am glad I decided to give them a shot! Thank you!!
5 I love the care I receive from Complete Care Medicine.  I am able to get an appointment in a very timely manner.  I also appreciate that on the day of my appointment, there is hardly any waiting.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The only PA I have seen is Trent Blake.  He is very knowledgeable, kind and caring.  He takes his time and explains everything very well.  I have family and friends that have seen other providers in the office and they are as equally satisfied.  I highly recommend this Family Practice.
2 Came here on a work injury on new years day. Got a 1st/2nd degree burn at work and needed to get it treated. I sat in the waiting room for 4 hours until I was finally seen. Was given prescrit burn cream and ibuprofen. The nurse that took my vitals was short with me and very rude but the male doctor that looked at me was very nice, calming and professional. I would not come here again if I needed urgent care. I lost a whole days work for something that could have been treated at work or at home. I do not recommend this place to anyone.
5 In 2007, my car was rear-ended by a over-sized truck.  I blew a disc in my lower back (L5/S1) and 4 in my neck (C3-C8).  I have seen several pain management doctors over the years, and in my experience, Dr. Ruggeroli is the best.    His diagnoses have been quick and accurate.  His treatments are effective and never scheduled too far into the future, whereas some other doctors schedule treatments 6-8 weeks into the future.  C'mon people, this is Pain Management.  Waiting hurts.    His office is extremely personable, and I am usually seen within 10-15 minutes of my appointment time.  I strongly recommend this doctor.
1 IF YOUR CHILD IS UNDER 6 MONTHS, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME TAKING THEM HERE.  My husband and I took our 3 month old here because she had been congested for a couple of days and then threw up and started feeling feverish.  They charged us our $75 co-pay and then we waited almost 2 hours to see the practitioner who basically told us that they didn't have the tools available to see such a small child - then why the hell weren't we told that at the front desk and then made to wait while our child got worse?!  They took her temperature 3 times with a thermometer (which I had already done at home) which they kept telling us wasn't going to be correct because it wasn't made for babies and then told us that we should either take her to Goodnight Pediatrics or the hospital.  The practitioner even admitted that he doesn't know why they don't just tell people with infants to go somewhere else.  After waiting such a long time there, we just decided to go straight to the ER from there.  If we'd just gone to the hospital to begin with, our daughter wouldn't have been kept up until after midnight while they were running all kinds of tests.  So basically we were charged $75 (and will probably receive more bills for who knows what?) so that our daughter could suffer longer.  In hindsight, we should have read reviews before bringing her here and possibly just gone to a better urgent care location.  Now we know.  Sidenote:  The door to the patient rooms was kept open the entire time and we could clearly hear the nurses proceeded to discuss other patient's issues.  I'm sure that the good people at Banner Health would be upset to know that their employees are in direct violation of HIPPA laws.
5 The staff at BackFit are great! Would recommend this clinic for any Chiropractic and primary care any day!
1 Terrible online service! I ordered one item and didn't receive it until 2 months later....after calling 3 times and an email a month out saying it had shipped, just to call again and find out it wasn't shipped. Will never order from them again.
5 Mojo Physio was my go to when it came to therapy during my time playing high school sports. They really were a big part of keeping me on the court and improving my overall sports performance. Really friendly therapists, and best pricing around!
4 Good place with good doctors. The staff in general is okay however they always seem so busy because the place is usually jam packed. Walk ins can be tricky you better be on time and ready since they only accept a limited number. Appoints can be slow and often 2 or 3 weeks ahead of what you were expecting. Best to have your doctor fill in a bunch of future dates for you. Friendly folk and great location overall. Doctors are awesome and willing to sit and listen to you and offer great advise. Thanks Desert Bloom!
5 Adam and his team are incredibly knowledgeable, professional and somehow make working out and stretching enjoyable.  Over the past 6 months I have learned exercises to strengthen the muscle areas i needed to most and in so doing have improved my golf game.  Thanks  Adam
5 Love Dr Lundquist! She has helped me tremendously with my pain issues!
5 Doctor Iris is the BEST Doctor in the world.  she knows her stuff!  She is most compassionate, non-judgmental and really does care about her patients.  (including me!)
1 If I could give it ZERO stars I would!!! My Mom was taken there from the hospital, she had pancreatic cancer. Upon arrival it took about two hours before her intake was ever performed. This was after every fifteen minutes of checking to see what the delay was. Intake nurse did not get information correct not even her name. They kept calling her by name for the two days she was there, When I asked them to correct this, they changed the name on her chart/notebook, never apologized in fact when they changed the name they looked at me and said you never saw this. WRONG thing to say to me.   My Mom was discharged from hospital without nausea medicine which is a whole different review for the hospital. I emphasized with the intake nurse that she must have Nausea medicine, most people with pancreatic cancer are on it every day, four times a day, she was no exception. The intake nurse informed me that he would contact the Doctor and get this straightened out before nights end. (We arrived at 5:00 pm and were there until 9:00pm) Upon checking with Head Nurse before departure, was informed that she would have it that night, not to worry. By the next day when we arrived, she had still not had the medicine. This created such a vicious cycle, that she was so nauseated she could not swallow her pain meds. A very sad and traumatic event for a pancreatic cancer patient. They informed me they would check with the Doctor about the meds, waited hours and nothing. If I had nausea meds left from home, I would have went home and got them, but at this point she couldn't keep anything down by mouth. Finally got some anti nausea second night, after confronting nurse after nurse. My Mom had  a pic line placed in at the hospital, but they would not use it, as it takes a registered nurse not an LPN to do that.  By the next morning my Mom was in such pain, that she wanted Hospice called. To shorten story, that was pretty much the end for my Mom. We all realized that her chances of survival were slim from the get go, but going to Sante caused her numerous issues, problems and pain that no one should endure. I am quite sure if she had not gone to that rehab center, she  would have survived longer. We will never know if she could have overcome and gone into remission thanks to Sante.
5 I've been going to WFP for 10+yrs, amazing service and with only one negative experience with a doctor who is no longer there. Dr.Tom Willim's is one of the best doctors I could have ever been blessed to work with, a great hearted and genuine person just like the rest of the fun & loving staff!
5 Dr. George is absolutely the best doctor. His commitment to his patients has proven to be a priority. He takes his time so you do not feel rushed through. Dr. George always explains and informs the patient until they feel comfortable and satisfied. He diagnoses with accuracy and confidence and his bedside manner is wonderful. In my experience all calls/messages have been returned in a timely manner.  He is involved in all aspects of his practice. He can answer or get you an answer wether it be from the billing department, lab, or scheduling department. He or his office staff helps in assisting to schedule all diagnostic appointments needed. HIs office staff is welcoming, kind, and very helpful. Dr. George has provided care for my family for better than 8yrs. He has held our hand and comforted us through the worst. Outstanding!
1 Terrible place.had really high b.p. and chronic anxiety issues,they wouldn't help me at all.waist of time and money there p.a.s. have little knowledge and l.Q.
1 Oh Avoid this place @ ALL Costs. They will double bill your insurance, run tests that they do not bother to #1 inform you they're running & #2 you cannot get test results even on tests they run. They are very unprofessional & treat you as if you are a hassle to them. You will get billed for $53.00 for going in on Sunday which they consider to be a weekend visit. My son wound up going to Southern Hills Hospital & what a blessing it was to meet Dr. Sondrup & his staff. Dr. Hayes & Dr. Daulat have no business in the medical field. They spent all of 7 minutes with my son on 4 different visits {not the 5 they are billing for}. Honestly, they should be ashamed of themselves & may God have mercy on their souls.
5 I came to Ron at Maximum Velocity about 2 months ago, barely able to walk, using a crutch and feeling overwhelmed with pain and failure.  Three months had passed since my knee surgery and not only had I not made any progress, I felt like my body was crumbling around me. My other knee felt like it was giving out, my back was in constant pain, and the post-op knee was weak, bent and swollen. In short, I was desperate. I was back in the United States for just a few months before having to return overseas where physical therapy options were very limited.  Meanwhile, I wondered if I would ever walk normally again and if the summer was even enough time to make a dent in my recovery.  Fast forward to the present day, I haven't used a crutch to walk in weeks. I can walk up and down stairs, do squats, and have experienced a metamorphous of healing physically and mentally that I never thought possible in such a short time. My life has changed from feeling broken and hopeless to feeling strong and optimistic. One of the most important aspects of my time with Ron has been education. Ron has taught me how to interpret, categorize and address my body's movement and its relationship with pain. Without this, I think I would still be sitting with my icepacks and TENS machine waiting for the pain to get better. I am so grateful to Ron for everything. Words seem grossly inadequate, but Ron saved me, and if there is anyone out there who is feeling like they are out of options this is the place for you.   There are many reviewers on here who are athletes for whom Ron has helped, but I wanted to write a review specifically for that person who might be feeling intimidated; wondering if this place is only for super athletes.  I remember looking at much of the sports related information and thinking, "I'm I the sort of person that belongs in a place like this?" I worried that I might be too broken or not athletic enough to feel comfortable.  I am so glad that I didn't listen to my fears and I found enough courage to walk through the doors because once I did, I realized that my concerns were completely unfounded. I have always felt comfortable here. I call Ron "The calm dad" he has a very serene exterior, but he's going to expect that you push yourself to your full potential, whatever that may be for you as an individual.  I'm deeply grateful that a place like Maximum Velocity exists and that Ron has created a place of healing and strength for all. He completely changed the way I understand my body and I have achieved more movement and strength than I have had in a decade.
3 The fact that you can book a time for a walk-in appointment is definitely a plus. However, every time I've had a walk-in appointment, I've waited 15 minutes in the lobby. Additionally, the last time I visited, I literally waited 40 minutes to see a doctor - appointment was for 2:40 and I was drafting this review at 3:22.   Of course, this is better than waiting hours at a normal walk-in but it still is a bit misleading to say you can make appointments. Mind you, I have read that they charge you if you are ever late for your walk-in appointment. Kind of a double-standard if you ask me.   Beyond the medical services, I do go here for massage therapy when needed. Megan Kerik was referred to me and I'd gladly refer her to anyone else. She is very personable and knowledgable.
5 I had been to several doctors after suffering a seizure.   Dr. Fabito was the only doctor who gave me my life back.  He knows his stuff, doesn't bother with all the drug addicts that are looking for drugs.  I can honestly say, he saved my life. I will be forever grateful to him.
5 Brandon's very good. He's 6'8" with a background in competitive athletics. If you think you're a big human, you're not. Brandon is a big human.   In the last couple of years that I've been going to Brandon, he's worked on me for maintenance, for miscellaneous back tweaks that one gets when with young kids at home and has shepherded me through my various starts, stops and random injuries of an on-again off-again running routine.   He does a lot of ART-based soft tissue work before he does any adjusting. For every minute he spends adjusting, he'll typically spend 5 - 10 working soft tissue and trying to find root cause. His ability to seek out and help correct non-obvious muscular-skeletal issues is outstanding.   Great guy. Wonderful practitioner. Consistently good results.
1 I foolishly switched family doctors to Dr. Agarwal a little while ago because my former family doctor's wait times were +2 hours and I'm always able to see a doctor right away at this clinic.   She isn't the friendliest doctor, and despite the clinic always being empty, doesn't really seem interested in getting to know her patients, which is something I feel is important for a family doctor to do.   But the real annoyance was last week when I went to her with a few health concerns and when she didn't have an answer for me she GOOGLED both of them right there in front of me. As if that's not the first thing I did, which lead me see my doctor? She simply referred me to other doctors and sent me on my way. Very disappointing.
1 I purchased a Groupon for a massage from Zen Massage.  I waited about 4 months to schedule because I assumed they were swamped right after the Groupon offer and I wanted a quality massage.  They scheduled me with Micco since I did not know anyone there.   I have experienced over 50 massages in many countries and this was the worst massage I had ever received in my life!  No matter how bad massages had been in the past, I had never thought of stopping in the middle and leaving, but that was all I could think of during the whole massage.  It was 50 minutes of someone barely rubbing my skin with no pattern or technique.  After my massage, I notified the clerk that it was horrible.  I asked if he was new and they said yes but "he had his own massage practice before".  She said she would have the manager call me.  The manager called within a couple days and I relived the miserable story.  Her first comment is that they are independent contractors so "they have no control or responsibility over the services".  She said she had a meeting planned with the owner and she would see if they could do something and she would call me back.  More than a month has passed and no call.  Unless you have a specific referral, I would avoid this place like the plague.  Horrible massage and no customer service!  Say no to Micco for sure.
5 ​*BACKFIT HEALTH & SPINE - PHX* I happen to live in the area and pass by the business quite frequently going to the brow place and nail salon a couple doors down. I was pleased to see the good reviews on Google where they offered a discount and convenient scheduling. My initial visit was a thorough consultation plus x-ray and scheduled a follow up visit to discuss a treatment plan. Veronica came up with a financial plan since I was uninsured at that time. I was diagnosed with Dextro-scoliosis is a specific term meaning scoliosis of the spine with a curvature of the spine to the right. Through physical therapy, acupuncture and adjustments starting with three times a week to once a week and now once a month. I couldn't be more pleased with the results. The entire staff is professional, caring, knowledgeable and patient. I would recommend checking in, when the pain has got you checked out.​
5 I absolutely LOVE this place, they give personalized one on one attention to every class. If you are at all worried about taking a reformer class this is the place to try. There are only two people and you plus the instructor in each class.  The teacher makes sure you are doing every move correctly. I love Helen, she is great, she knows me my strength and weaknesses and will help me improve. Now because there are only two spots in each class they do book up fast so you need to be on top of booking your classes, but they have a great app for that. LOVE this place referred my mom and now we go together
4 I had a positive experience here. I enjoy the doctors, staff, think the facility is well updated and innovative.  I enjoy that it is nearby my home as well.
1 I would never recommend this place to anyone... I had the worst experience with the entire staff. They just want your money, not to help you when you're sick. I'm not one to complain but when you continuously reach out to the office and never receive a phone call back, they don't care about patients.
5 Yes wait times are long but that is because she actually spends time with each patient. I'd rather wait to be seen by a good doctor then not wait and be seen by a bad Doctor. I love her and her staff they are all great. My last Doctor treated me like crap! Dr Adams is awesome! It's nice to find out what is going on with your health rather than just having the doctor give you drugs and send you on your way. I refer her to friends and family all the time. She is a caring knowledgeable Doctor with awesome staff.
1 They are inconsiderate and have no compassion this is the worst doctors office I have been to would not recommend this to no one
1 I was recently searching for a new primary care physician and was referred to Total Wellness by two different people so I had high expectations for my visit. I scheduled my appointment but then come day of, I arrived and was informed that the doctor was exposed to something and had to cancel all her appointments. I was completely content with that as I understand things happen outside of their control so we rescheduled for 2 weeks from then. During that initial visit I got a feeling of unprofessionalism in the way the staff spoke to me and each other but I brushed it off and left.  The morning of my next visit I called to confirm my appointment since I didn't receive a confirmation call only to find out that my appointment hadn't been reschedule after all. The receptionist said I could come anyway which was kind so I headed down. When I walked in I waited in a short line to check in then began filling out my new patient paperwork in the sitting room. While I was completing the forms I couldn't help but listen to the TV that was set to a channel equivalent to Star magazine with its celebrity gossip and inappropriate banter about cheating spouses and other mind numbing topics.  After filling out the paperwork I waited for 2 hours before I finally had to leave without getting seen to make it to another appointment. I understand how busy doctors are but not once did any staff member apologize for the long wait time to me or any other one of the 10-15 patients who waited an equal or greater amount of time than myself. Even a small gesture like this can make the world of difference in my experience.   Upon leaving I called to let them know I wouldn't be able to wait any longer. When asked if I wanted to reschedule I said no and mentioned that I was disappointed with their customer service thus far. Their response was an indifferent "okay, bye."   My search for a family doctor continues, but I certainly do not recommend visiting Total Wellness.
3 Just - OK and I am very disappointed as I have never had a bad experience with this office until today. I chose not to vaccinate my son at his physical visit in Jan.  In June I changed my mind and decided when I talked to the PA (who was seeing another of my children for a wellness visit) that he would get them. She told me I could just come on Friday with my son and he wouldn't need an appointment since he already had his physical in Jan. of this year and did not need to be seen. I told this to the front desk when I brought him in today, Friday, as instructed by the PA.  I was told that he would need an appointment because "it takes time for the doctor to see which vaccines the assistant needs to give." I had the lifetime immunization record with me but that meant nothing to them. I was told that I should have taken care of it in January. I can go to a Walgreens minute clinic or vaccination clinic, have the immunizations paid 100% by insurance, and not have to pay for a Dr. appt. I am so disappointed. Sadly, the PA who I saw is leaving and she happened not to be there today. She was awesome. If I was rating on that visit,  it would be 5 stars - she was logical. He didn't need to see a Dr. he just needed his vaccinations. My daughters have appointments next week and I will talk to the PA about my experience today. I really don't want to change doctor offices but I am fast becoming wary.
5 Been going their since 2008 and really have only good things to say about them.  I also have had great experiences with his female PA and his nurses have gone out of their way to help me several times.  I have recommended them to several friends and family who are also happy with them and their staff.
5 Best place to go in Las Vegas. Especially if you don't have health insurance. Dr Sharma is absolutely amazing doctor. Before I found him i changed 3 doctors who can't understand what exactly wrong and couldn't treat me right. And I don't have insurance so I just keep spending money for nothing. He was able to explain everything very well to me so I have a really good  understanding of what's actually going on with my health. I'm so thankful to found this place! Dr Sharma is very carrying and he pays attention to details. I felt myself great being his patient. He sent me for several analysis and found a problem and solution for it. Only one thing they supposed to call you after they have all results which they didn't after a week so I just called myself to reception and doctor call me back in an hour. But it's understandable they got pretty busy.   If I would know where to go in the beginning I would save a lot of money and keep myself out of so much stress. Lowest prices for great service is absolutely bonus as well. Dr Sharma is great.
5 It was my first time coming in for a massage. Booking was fast and easy online.  I couldn't help but praise the professionalism and expertise of Andrea. She's very honest and she well focused on my problem spots. She exactly knew what's wrong and manage to make my upper back and shoulder less tense as possibly. I was glad I came here and booked with her just basing on the reviews here.  Go see Andrea, can't wait to book another therapy. She only recommended to come in if the pain comes back, but she assured me that I should be okay with light exercises and I should be okay in 4-6 weeks but if problem comes back to go see her again asap.  Love her honesty and expertise. I can give her 10 stars if I could.  Only issue was they weren't able to bill my insurance directly because I didn't have a physicians/ family doctors note, which is pretty odd cause I never needed a note form the other clinics before but that's okay, hopefully next time it won't happen again, I'll for sure be back to see Andrea again that's for sure.
5 Clean, modern practice. I have only had morning scheduled appointments so I cannot comment on mid-day wait times, but I was always seen promptly.  The only doctor I've seen there so far is Dr. Singh, and he's been excellent. He's helpful, patient, and very friendly.
2 When they were Town Medical Group , we never had a problem. But over the course of the last year the service has gone down hill. Dr Roberts is okay but even she has become more of a "here's what the computer says we have to do" kind of doctor than what she was before. The office staff is rude and inconsiderate. And they literally have a 15 min window  of opportunity for your appointment so if you get stuck in traffic or take a wrong turn, you might as well just turn around and go home. They could care less and they will just reschedule you for another month out. If you have a choice - go somewhere else!
5 I received excellent care from Paragon. This family owned business is a real gem. They significantly reduced my acute neck pain and I am on a plan to full recovery. All treatments are in a private room. Thank you SO much.
2 I have been waiting weeks for my lab results and I have called during what they state as normal business hours on the recording, yet the answering message says to call back during business hours on a different phone number and not stating its their answering service.  There is no voicemail. I can see waiting a week for lab results and I have been checking online daily, yet, it was May 16th when I had the blood draw and it's now June 8th...almost a month later. My PA just moved to this practice, so I'm not sure where's the hold up when previously it took 3 days for labs.
5 Indeed the best Chiropractic doctor in town! Been adjusted by others in the past and there is no question its all about knowing the body/spine and how to manipulate it so that you feel better not worse...and Dr. Mancuso knows.
4 I like Dr. Nahin....Chose him from the list we had for Direct Care Providers through my work insurance. Kinda skeptic in the beginning but he's actually a good choice. Very precise and listens to your concerns.   I also chose him because of the location of the office. They got bigger but they're still across St. Rose San Martin hospital.
1 I initially went to Bellagio because I purchased a Groupon for 2 spider vein removal treatments for leg veins. Well, trusting the yelp reviews (at that time was pretty good), I decided I may as well see if they could help with my facial spider veins as well. I should've ran after my initial consult because I waited nearly 40 minutes before being seen by Alexis, and even then, for only 10 minutes -- TOPS!  Yah ... so stupid me, decided to purchase this "deal" she gave me -- three 30 minute laser treatments for my facial spider veins AND sun spots for $300. The same tech treated me for my legs and 2 of my facial treatments. She was very meticulous and took her time, basically all if not most of the 30 minute session. BUT ... I saw all of ONE 1/2" vein (a large one, at that) disappear from one of my legs. Everywhere else was like NOTHING happened ... oh, I forgot - nothing but the pain fr the laser. It was like getting jabbed by a needle every the laser went off.  My third treatment was by a different tech as, according to Alexis, my previous tech was too slow and patients weren't getting results. I got Kyle, who, according to Alexis, was their best laser tech. I waited at least 15 minutes before being called in, then another 10 before Kyle saw me ... then he zapped my face for all of 10-15 minutes -- if that! Not only that, but he said there were no notes on my file as to what laser settings the previous tech had treated me on. Nice. So he was basically zapping based on my pain tolerance.  Needless to say, I was NOT happy after leaving the last treatment as I felt I was ripped off my other 15 minutes of treatment time. I went in on another day to talk to Alexis about it and she tried to tell me that the treatments I purchased for was TREATMENTS, NOT treatment TIME (30 each session). I'm like - um, I have the receipt w/ that written on that I was buying three 30 minute treatments. Nice right - tell your customers they're wrong!  Alexis gave me a "complimentary" treatment for the last incident. But really ... so four laser facial vein treatments later,  there is NO improvement on my facial veins. I feel like a fool for wasting $400 at this poor excuse for a med spa. Oh, and Alexis offered to "make it up" by offering me the SAME DEAL again because I need more sessions to really see results. Ya ... fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me! I don't think so. Pass.
2 The only thing this place has going for it is Dana herself. She is good. I was diagnosed with a kidney infection, the nurses forgot to give me my prescription for antibiotics. When I called to ask about it the next day the nurse said I was never given a prescription from the doctor that the shot I was given was strong enough. At my follow up appointment 2 days after my original appointment my symptoms were worse. I was still charged for the visit and the nurses were so rude when I asked them questions...this explains why her practice has such a high turn over.
4 It's a little bit difficult to reach the clinic by phone to set up appointments, that's why I gave them 4 stars. The place was neat & clean, I went there for laser hair removal & noticed that my hair started falling out after 1 session, so so far it seems like it works.  They use Soprano XL, which they advertise as the best for laser hair removal.
5 Very knowledgable staff that make therapy fun. I had so much improvement in my knee pain after two months of their help. Would highly recommend!
5 He's a great Dr.  Spends all the time you need with him, great bedside manner, answers all questions as to the the who, what, when, or why.  Straight shooter.  I've also never had an issue with his front staff or nurses, so not sure what those comments on other's post are about.  I've been going to him since he was back on Ray/Rural.  Very nice guy, with alot of answers and advice.  I've spent time around plenty of Doctors, his demeanor is one of the best in my book.  Been a patient for at least 10yrs.  Thanks Ish!
5 Vegas is not known for having great doctors and as a patient,  we should beware and do our research. We found Dr. Chamian through a referral from a highly respected family friend who is also in the medical field. She warned us that Dr. Francesca Chamian may not be accepting new patients, but we gave it a shot anyways. My mother-in-law began seeing Dr. Chamian shortly after she had her open heart surgery and relocated to Vegas. She couldn't stop raving about the excellent care she received there. After my first visit with Dr. Chamian, I understood why she was in such high demand. To explain my experience, imagine you have a favorite aunt who is always happy and likes spending time talking with you...and she happens to be a very thorough and knowledgeable doctor. Dr. Chamian actually listens and doesn't dismiss you or any symptoms you tell her you are experiencing. In fact, she treats you like a concerned family member who should get ----- checked or tells you to see a specialist "just to be safe", unlike most other physicians who try to scoot you out as quick as possible. There is a deep comfort in having her as your doctor. She cares about her patients and her waiting room is always full of us lucky few who have the privilege of seeing her. Her staff is always friendly and jovial and try their best to keep your info up to date. I hear wonderful things from other patients about her husband as well. We're very grateful for Dr. Chamian.
1 This  clinic is run like a factory!  No personal attention what so ever. Waiting room is very busy.  They don't allow Clints to use office restroom. But rather sand you to a bathroom in another building .   I had a very invasive laser treatment by their led nurse on my face.  She promised me that my recovery will take 4 days. As it worked out it actually took 2 weeks. Big difference !!!  I believe I should have been told the truth...! Also to add insult to insury,  no one ever bothered to check on me, to make sure I was in fact ok. and taking good care of my bured off skin,the right way . When I left the office I was very much out of it.  Anyway,It never happened !!!  Also at all appts. Before , and after treatment and recover they were NEVER on time. I waited close to 1 hr. at all appts.  I deffenatly WILL NOT go back. Too many other spas out there, happy to give personel service.
5 Today my wife and I tried this place out after purchasing it on a Groupon. We had never done any type of float spa before. This place was amazing, the staff is super sweet and it was extremely clean!!! Very impressed and will be back again.
5 Petersen Physical Therapy was a great clinic! I went 3x per week for 6 weeks to help restore my strength and range of motion from a broken humerus, and every time I went, everyone was very upbeat and friendly and personable. The employees all seem to enjoy their jobs, from the PTs and PTAs right down to the techs.  More importantly, I'm a lot better off than I was before. Obviously no clinic can be expected to get you back to 100% in such a short time period, but I'd say they got me back to 70%, and I feel very comfortable continuing my exercises on my own at home as I work toward 100%. What was especially great was that I could stay as long as I needed to get everything done. I've been to PT before, and most of the time it felt like I had to be done in an hour; but at Petersen, I was often there for 90 minutes or even 2 hours - however long I needed. And every single time, the PT or PTA would spend a good 20 minutes either stretching me out or giving me a deep muscle massage. I feel like that really helped accelerate my recovery.  I think the only thing that could've been better would have been more direct attention throughout my exercises. If they happened to notice me doing something wrong, they'd correct me, but often times I felt like they weren't paying much attention to my form since they were busy with other patients. But maybe that's just what happens when there's more patients than employees.
1 This place Sucks! Sitting in the waiting area as I type this! The last 3 appointments my father in law had here we waited about an hour just to be seen for 5 min. To get a prescription refill.  Ridiculous! Been waiting for 55 min now. See people get called back that's been waiting for 10 min. Sucks sucks sucks donkey balls! Wish I can give it ZERO STARS
5 2 years ago, when I needed to have physical therapy (known henceforth as PT) after my acl surgery, I came here and worked with Lauren whom I LOVED and ADORED.  She has since moved on to have her own practice. Good thing before she left, she told me how great Ben is so when my 6 year old son needed PT for his neck and back, I knew just who to ask for. Luckily for us, Ben does do pediatric PT as my son is 6 years old.  He was soooo great with my son, my son loved going to the sessions.  In fact, he looked forward to them.  As the mother, you can imagine how touched and grateful I am to Ben that while he was healing my son, he was also playing games with him, making him laugh and happy. Ben made my son feel like he was more than just another "case" to him.  He made my son feel like he cared about him. I am also soooo appreciative of the endless patience Ben had for me as he answered ALL of my questions regarding my concerns and worries for my son's recovery. I think I can write for all parents that when we take our kids to the doctors, physical therapist, ANYWHERE, we want to go to a place where we feel cared for and feel like we can trust the person that is working with our kids and Ben is definitely that person. The facility itself is conveniently located off the 51 & Bell.  The space is large and has everything you would need for full recovery.  The owner Richard is very nice.  The front office staff is super friendly and nice.  And of course, this location has the two best physical therapists on the planet (Lauren who worked with me but has since go on to have her own practice) and BEN who just might be one of Andrew's favorite guy of all time.  Hugs all around to everyone here!
1 My Primary care referred me to this place for my injured wrist. It was one of worst experience I have ever had with any care provider. The receptionist (Kaitleen) completely ignored the fact that my Primary sent my X-Ray report and almost made me do another X-Ray there. She was very impatient and kept complaining about her working hours with her colleague in front of the patients. I had a 3:10pm appointment and did not see a doctor (Frank Raia) until 4:30pm. The doctor spent probably less than 5 minutes with me.
5 I'm satisfied with the service and wait times here. Television to watch, Water & Coffee available while you wait. They offer snacks when they can. Restroom is near. No problems while coming from time to time to do test and blood work for my new employer.
5 My daughter is a gymnast and last year had injured the growth plate in her left knee. We were fortunate enough to find TSPT. We met with Jimmy one of the PT and he was amazing with her. Everyone there is so so good to us. They are so friendly and have made it feel like home.we saw Joe & Tim also and all the PT's were cautious with her. They always took their time and explained every question we always had. They make you feel at home there. They also run a sports program for training and both my boys have been working out there ever since. They LOVE it and look forward to their crazy workouts twice a wk. I can't say enough about the facility that's always clean and the employees who always make us feel like we are part of the family. This is a place of you or anyone in your family need physical therapy you should go!
5 I have been attending group events (pilates, yoga fusion class, group run) at Mindful Motion this summer.  I have had a good experience with the group events, but I also feel that Jessica and Nathan are professional and know what they are doing when it comes to physical rehab and I would absolutely recommend them to anyone. Mindful Motion is new to the area, but both Jessica and Nathan are experienced in physical therapy.  The Mindful Motion Physical Therapy space is nice, comfortable, and welcoming.  When you find yourself with a painful back, knee, or other injury - why not check them out?!  I would.
5 Paul is great, really knows what he's doing. Had some neck, back issues + he made things alot better. Thanks Paul :-)
1 Could have given zero stars if possible.Havent seen Dr Barbee yet.Its been almost 1 hour past my appointment time.Still waiting for the doctor.
2 Having a good experience at a doctor's office is hard to come by. I found Caring for Families through my insurance provider. I thought they had to be decent if they were recommended but I am not impressed. The last time I went in to be seen, I didn't wait very long in the waiting room but I waited in an exam room for what felt like an eternity. It was freezing cold. Then when the doctor came in, I felt like I was being rushed and that my opinion did not matter. I was given some antibiotic that I said did not work the last time but the doctor didn't care. I asked for something stronger and was told to come back in a week if I wasn't feeling better. Really? I told you it doesn't work. If you want an appointment within a day or two, they are good but if you can wait for another place, do it.
5 I just finished my second session with Rowena at body resonance. It's not exactly massage and it's not exactly therapy but it is quite healing. Body Resonance works on your body's facial layer, in binding the knots in the web which covers all muscle, organs and ligaments. Interesting science, too say the least.   If you're experiencing physical pain caused by injury or accident, or physical pain that's manifesting from an emotional trauma, encourage you to check out this practice. It's soothing decor and friendly staff invite you in. The owner is very passionate and knowledgeable.  It's interesting because this technique is very good for not only has grown ups, but children and babies as well as our pets that are experiencing physical stress. You have to experience it to understand it. And I encourage you to do so.
5 It is so hard to find a doctor in Vegas who actually cares and is willing to take the time to find out everything that is going on with you. My friend recommended Dr. AJ and I'm glad she did!!! On my very first visit he probably spent 20-30 mins with me. There usually is a wait so I make sure I don't have anything planned afterwards. However, I know that I am waiting because he makes sure that he spends enough time with each patient to fix their issue/sickness and make sure they understand everything. And when it's my turn I know I will also get that amazing over the top service. Thank you Dr. AJ!!
5 This urgent care was the most pleasant and quickest one I've been to. The staff is so nice and friendly. They made me feel very comfortable and took care of all my needs. They even fill your prescriptions here, which is totally convenient. They are even open every day until 9pm! I will definitely return here and will recommend them to my family and friends.
5 I have complex back and nerve issues, and have been to several physical therapists in the last 10 years.  When a recent flare up occurred, I skipped the doctor's office and went to see them based on a referral. I am glad I did. Annie Henry was terrific. She listened, she tested my body, and retested it, then asked more questions. Her diagnosis and solutions were superior.   I went in with disabling sciatica pain, and in two visits, the pain was gone. I continued another few weeks to exercise and strengthen certain muscle groups.  Not entirely satisfied, she re-tested, and made me do new work.  The pain has not returned, now 2 months in... thanks for the dedication.
1 Was referred to the Core Institute by a Banner hospital after my motorcycle accident. My thumb had swelled up to the size of a tennis ball and at the ER they said there was no broken or fracture bones but thought I had skiers thumb. I made an appointment and was seen by a PA, a week after the accident. He found I did have a hair line fracture on the metacarpal bone by looking at the X-ray from the ER and was shocked they missed it. So I was put in a short hand cast and told to come back in a week for new X-rays. I came back and my appointment was at 8:00 am, I got there at 7:50 am. I was taken back to a exam room, sat there for 15 min and then the MA realized I needed X-rays so she had me sit in the waiting area for them. No one was getting X-rays done and the 2 X-ray techs were in the X-ray room gossiping for 25 min until one came to get me and took 3 X-rays of my hand. 2 X-rays were taken almost the same way, hand flat on the table and the only difference between them was the way I had my fingers, thumb never moved. The last was taken of my palm up. I was then taken back to the exam room and waited 30 min for the PA to see me. He came in and we went over my X-rays. 2 of the X-rays showed just a hair line fracture but the other which was one of the ones they took the same way twice had a completely broken bone. He then left the room to talk to a doctor, who I don't who and the PA came back in to tell me I needed pins put in. I asked if we could get a CT scan done cause that shows the bone better then an X-ray and I honestly believe the X-ray with the broken bone wasn't of my hand because the thumb bones were different shapes and sizes then the other 2 X-rays. But the PA said I didn't need it and I needed to schedule surgery ASAP. I told him I wanted a second opinion which he said I had every right too, but he would have the surgery scheduling dept call me. He had me taken out of my cast and put in a split in case I had surgery. An hour after I had left the surgery dept called and I told them I was seeking a second opinion at which point they became rude and gave me a hard about seeking it, so I hung up.   I got my second opinion, they did a CT scan and found it was a fracture and the bone was not broken so no need for surgery. Its been 5 weeks since the accident, I'm in a Velcro cast and the fracture line is almost gone.  The Core Institute seemed fine at first but on the second visit I realized they just wanted to do an unnecessary surgery to get more money, they wouldn't do a CT scan do put my mind at easy told me they didn't care and the fact I never saw a MD once, even when they wanted to do surgery was BS. I never even got a call back to check up on me and see if I got a second opinion.
1 Worst medical facility ever! There was maybe 4 people ahead of me and it took 2 1/2 hours to see a Dr. And it's filthy dirty. I went to use the bathroom and OMG, there was dirt in every corner and the trash had bloody tissue in it and urine stains on the floor. It was nasty.  While I was in the room waiting to see ... Well ... Anyone, I could hear the staff in the lounge across from me making fun of other patients and sharing their ailments! It was so rude. Finally when the Dr. Showed up and who was probably the worst Dr. I've ever been too. He had such an awful attitude the minute he walked in the door. I felt like a cow being herded along! He was so rude and condescending ! I will NEVER go back there again. He was so rude I just got up and walked out on him. It's a real low life scene and if I get sick from being there I'm going to sue the crap out of them. DONT GO HERE,
4 I am a patient of Kelly Harris, she is very professional and friendly. The facilities are clean, they work fast and prepares the documents well. The only reason I would rate 4 start instead of 5 is because of the poker face front desk. She sure work fast, I do appreciate that, but on the Phone she sounds cold and not care if I really need help or not.
2 I would say 2.5 stars out of 5. I have mixed feelings about this place. I went in to see the sports medicine doctor a couple weeks ago. I already had an idea as to what my problem was.  (I don't think she did all the tests, but I forgot). She didn't introduce herself...! so I didn't catch her name (or maybe I don't remember). She seemed pretty knowledgeable, however I was not impressed with their policy/billing.  I understand that you can't have patients coming in and complaining that their entire body is in pain and expect the doctor to spend hours on them giving a full head to toe physical exam. Totally understandable. However, I do believe discretion is appropriate. She said she could only examine 1 joint at a time, and they make it very clear. I told her my doctor referred me to their office for bilateral knee pain. She said that they don't see the referral until right before they see the patient (okay). We had a little back and forth, and she begrudgingly agreed to examine both knees (I repeatedly pointed out they were related issues).  Can you imagine walking into the doctor's office complaining of wheezing, tachycardia, weight loss, diarrhea and palpations and the doctor telling you to pick one, because they can only discuss one issue at a time? You should run far away.  Medicine is meant to be discussed in a holistic manner. I don't think it's fair as a sports medicine clinic to say that you will only examine one joint. Everything is related on a biomechanical level.  Weakness in one joint will eventually cause compensations.  I think it's up to them to use their own discretion to determine if other symptoms are related. In my opinion, you are ethically obligated to consider everything your patient complains of. Yes, it's important to set the line and say I'm sorry but I can only examine one issue today, but I'd be happy to discuss that with you in a future appointment. Considering their complaints are important. What if 2 unrelated issues are 100% related and a result of a systemic disease.  Acknowledging that you've considered their complaints goes a long way, even if you don't have time to look into both. Anyways, someone that is passionate about what they're doing would have examined everything anyways (eg. back pain: everything from arm & foot pain, tingling, neck, abdominals, shoulders, posture, hips to feet). I am guessing OHIP & bureaucracy is to blame.  Anyways I probably spent 10-15 minutes on my exam and interview. Oh did I forget to mention, why did she take a look at my feet and hip? They're so unrelated... Was she good? Yes.   The only solution she offered was physiotherapy. Looking back, I wish I had asked her to address some other issues, oh well too late. (She didn't seem too interested in me anyways; although I appreciate that she wasn't pushy)  Anyways, would I come back? Maybe if I had money and time to blow. I looked at their physio prices (which aren't cheap btw; there are some places that are cheaper; with one on one manual therapy and give you 100% of their attention). But I will admit I am pretty curious about what they'd have to offer.  But, from first impressions & based on the doctor's attitude can you imagine how much time & money the physiotherapists would be wasting? You could wind up coming back month after month with no improvement, if they aren't honest. No thanks, I can read up on the latest literature on my own. Bottom line, I would recommend this place, to check out. Would I say continue, well that's up to you. In my opinion, their attitude is definitely off putting.
5 I have been seeing Dr. David Williams for over ten years! In that time he has strived to learn, teach, and grow as a Doctor. He has so much to offer and can really help you feel better!!! Seems like he learns something new to help w/pain, anxiety, ect. w/each visit. Always friendly faces here and I always feel welcome :)
1 Worst experience with a Dr. office ever.  The office staff is awful and not helpful at all. Took 8 months to get a charge corrected that my insurance company and the Dr. both acknowledged was wrong but they expected me to call UHC no less than three times to follow up. I spent hours on the phone with them and they said they covered my charge. Phillips Clinic said it should be covered but they wouldn't deal with my insurance company directly so I had to waste my time. They sent my charge to collections! I eventually got it squared away but not until after wasting hours of my time. I almost paid the stupid charge just to get it over with.   I don't know if they are too busy or just incompetent but that wasn't even the issue that put me over the edge. I feel like they are Sales People in it for the money more than Medical Professionals. They convinced me to do more blood work last April and then tell me in August that some of the results needed to be addressed. Only of course after I came in for an appt. so they could make some money. What if it was something more serious? They did blood work and never looked at it?   I have since found a new Dr. and wouldn't recommend this place at all.   Then this email comes from OptumRX:  Thank you for placing your order with OptumRx® Home Delivery Pharmacy. We contacted your Doctor to approve your prescription for order number **********. However, we have not received a response from the physician's office and we are not able to complete your order.  For us to complete your order, please contact your Physician's office to respond to our prescription request. The Doctor can either fax your prescription to (800) 491-7997, E-Prescribe, or contact us at (800) 791-7658.
5 I cannot thank Dr. Staub enough for the relief his adjustments have brought me! After just a few weeks of treatments; I feel like a new person, with renewed health and hope.   I was unaware that my stress and overall ill feeling was caused by a spinal misalignment.   I'm grateful he was still willing to work with me even though I quit my program several times. He took the time to explain my condition in laymen's terms. He also explained my x-rays and other test results and what needed to happen for me to heal and correct the problem. He has given me the confidence to believe that my (quite serious) condition can be reversed and corrected. Dr Staub treats all his clients with the utmost dignity and respect. He works beautifully with children. His optimism and enthusiasm is very uplifting and encouraging; to both adults and children.   Sincere thank you, Dr Staub!
1 still negative. umc really wants to charge $26.85 for a so called david orbitz who claims he did a neck and spine ct!! seriously- so check it, if he so called checked my neck- he would have seen the carotid artery dissection! right?!, no- he wants to send over to a so called jimmy to read. it's not the point of money, it's the freaking principle! maybe he can't read as 4 other doctors from a different institution was able to see it! get outta here with your piss poor, lack of respect, lack of compassion, no degree having so called docs! i wouldn't be surprised if they were drunk like the so called doc at sunrise being sued! yes, i am filing complaints wherever i  can. yes, there are cameras in trauma and i really pray there is audio too! now, take your $26.85 and eat it. i'd rather it go to collections since you threatened me- i have it recorded too
4 I've been coming to One Medical Group for about 3 years now. It's usually just once a year for my annual check-up.   This was my first time at this location, and it was business as-usual. The service was what I have experienced and come to expect from One Medical Group offices (yes, from my two prior visits =D). It's quick, clean, and easy - the best part is that there's little to no wait time from when you see the doctor and when you appointment time is.   Oh and PS. There are 3 designated parking spots for the office! I'm sure these come handy when it's peak Scottsdale Fashion mall traffic times.
1 Do NOT allow your loved one to come here. My friend was choking so I ran to get the nurse. She came in, looked and said, well, you're breathing and talking. REALLY???? I asked them to empty the trash, they didn't. My friend hasn't been turned all day. He wanted  to change clothes, they couldn't be bothered. My friend wanted a soda refill for lunch, didn't get it. The general disposition,  they couldn't care less.
5 I just finished 8 weeks of physical therapy after a total knee replacement. I have nothing but positive experiences to report. As soon as you walk in the front desk staff are warm and friendly, and make an effort to remember your name. They also say goodbye when you are leaving.   My therapist was Erica, although I worked with Tony on occasion when she was not available. They both were very good at helping me to loosen up the knee and the muscles in my leg that were impacted by the surgery and the rehab work. Erica would ask with genuine interest how I was feeling before we started every session and she tried to tackle any problem that had come up between visits. She is very skilled and knowledgable.  My journey was a hard one, and there were days where I was not only feeling pain, but frustration and was completely discouraged at my slow progress. Everyone there was patient and understanding and simply gave me kleenex to dry my tears and encouraged me not to take on more that day than I was able to. That gave me the strength to do the full exercise course that had been designed for me.   The techs I worked with were Matt, Troy, Anika and Alex, and they also do a great job of explaining the exercises and keeping track of what i was doing and whether I was doing it right. And Erica was also right there on the floor the entire time, either with other clients or at her desk, so she was able to correct or change the way I was doing things.  If you are in need of PT, I highly recommend Foothills Sports Medicine.
5 Having a baby was hard on my body and I was extremely sad about so many changes and inconveniences I was having to live with but and I am excited to say that pelvic floor therapy was exactly what I needed! Angelique is amazing - she really helped me through a tough time and I really noticed the results! Six months postpartum and I am back to normal and feeling amazing!
4 I've been a patient there for several years and I have had very little problems with the office other than they have had some bad receptionists.  Dr. Daliah and Dr. Cory are suberbe physicians and genuinely care about their patients.
5 From the moment you walk into this office you feel completely welcome, every single person you come in contact with is warm and friendly. Dr. Brittany is extremely knowledgeable and SUCH a sweetheart! She took the time to work with my body, find out my symptoms, and take x-rays to find out exactly what was going on. The office works together to come up with a personalized plan to get people on track to being happier and healthier, I am so excited to see the results.
5 This guy knows what he is doing and he mastered the therapy for my wife's back pain. Highly recommend.
5 Doc was great. I have had tennis elbow for months. Could not work out, sleep and in pain a lot. Doc worked his magic and now I'm on the road for a great recover. I'm glad I went to them 100%.
2 Ridiculously long wait times! I'm not sure if they are understaffed or not, but to be seen for 5-10 minutes, you have to wait 45 mins to an hour with only one to two patients waiting in the lobby! We set a specific appt time for a reason.  This office is definitely lacking efficiency! In our previous pediatrics practice, whether it was a well or sick visit, we were in and out in 20 mins tops.
5 I went to 4 different RMTs in 2012 before finding Jennifer at RMT Studio and my search is now over. Whether you want a relaxing or deep tissue massage, Jennifer knows what she's doing. She has the great skill of knowing just the right amount of pressure to use and keeping it consistent throughout the session.   The location is downtown and easy to access, with a very relaxing layout and Jennifer herself is very knowledgeable and easy to talk to.   Also, another perk is the great music playlist that plays in the background. Stuff like the XX, Feist and Elliott Smith. A welcomed change from all those clinics that only play nature sounds.
4 This location is clean and very inviting - Staff is very friendly and very knowledgeable.  Keri gave me an amazing massage relieving my overall tension I had walked in with.  Overall just a great experience!  I've decided to go back for the micro-derm abrasion facial - will update after that experience.
4 I found this place on Yelp and was very optimistic about visiting here for the first time! As a Spa Associate myself, I am very picky on where I go and do my research first. Google, Yelp, and Facebook all had great reviews from clients! It was easy to book an appointment as you can call in or if you're busy in the office and unable to make calls (like myself), you can even send them a message through What's App and they will easily and quickly respond to help you schedule an appointment! This was a total bonus for customer service for me!  Upon arrival, I was nicely greeted and taken right away in my treatment room. The room was very spacious and clean. I tried out the afternoon special which came with a 45 minute foot massage and 15 minute neck/shoulder massage. My masseuse first started off with my neck/shoulder massage while my feet soaked in a tub of water, which was lined with a plastic bag for hygienic reason. The massage was amazing! Since I basically sit all day at a desk, the neck/shoulder massage really helped get the knots out of my upper back! Moving on to the foot massage...I was offered a bottle of water right before the foot massage, which was great. They even have big screen TVs in each room for you to watch while having your foot massage so there is no awkward silence during the 45 minutes. MY OH MY DID THE FOOT MASSAGE FEEL AMAZING!!! I absolutely love when I get the chance to have my feet massage and it's always never long enough when you get a pedicure...these 45 minutes were heaven to me!  Only minor complaints: my masseuse didn't speak English too well. I didn't mind too much since I don't like talking a lot during massages. Another thing I am confused about is whether these masseuses are registered? I'm not really complaining about it since I've maxed out my benefits for the year so I wouldn't need an insurance receipt. But I was not offered one at the end neither was I asked to fill out a registration/health history form at the beginning? Felt a bit odd to me since all the places I've worked (physio clinics, spas) we've always asked clients to fill out a health history form.   Anyway, I will definitely be coming back! I've told my coworkers and friends about this place and we all plan on doing a girls day here, especially with my girls that love foot massages! Can't wait!
4 Dr. Wingard has been my primary for about 12 years since my original Doctor went concierge.  Dr. Wingard is top notch in my book compared to most doctors in Las Vegas.  He knows me by name and actually listens to my problems/symptoms without rushing me through the appointment. Not one time did I ever leave without having everything addressed. Even when I asked what I believed was a stupid question, he made me feel comfortable and better informed.  He has never set me up with unnecessary tests and I never felt "ripped off".  He is very knowledgeable and up to date.  The only downside is that unless it's an emergency, appointments can take weeks, but unfortunately that's the state of healthcare today.
2 Staff is nice the dr's are nice but the wait time is atrocious!!! I had a 10 am appointment and it's 11:10 and still waiting!!!  Why have an appointment time if you can't keep it!!! My past 2 visits have been long waits.  If you are a busy person this is the place for you if time is an issue!!
5 I have seen Both Dr Holland and Janee, They are both caring and I feel so well taken care of.  I had some real serious problems to deal with and I saw Dr Holland a few weeks ago and he made sure I was taken care of and his front office staff had all the information they needed to get me the correct referrals. I never have to wait long and there is always an appointment within a timely manner.
5 I saw Kristan Hunt in ultrasound. She was amazing!!! I have had many ultrasounds in the last 2 years, and Kristan is the best!!! Thank you Kristan!!!
5 Fourth time here, and it's still a great office. I had made my appointment prior with my last visit, and yes I did receive the courtesy reminder call. I signed in and after a few minutes was placed in an exam room. I was quickly seen and out without a long drawn out visit.   I think this place is well organized and has a good working staff, everyone is very nice and I haven't been disappointed yet.
1 BEWARE!!!!!  I have gone here for years and now they have a new payment policy in place.  If you purchase your medication they take your CC number and put it on file.  I only found this out as they decided to drain my bank account without my authorization or even a phone call to let me know they were scheduling payments!  So nice of them to not obtain my approval as I had bills to pay and they will not credit my account back.  Never will I ever go back there again as Marcus, the corporate office worker, was so uncooperative and was a complete jerk!  Telling all my neighbors about it as well since we live right behind the Urgent Care.  Sad to say as I really like the staff at that location but I do not agree with how the place is run.
5 have been going this studio for over a year now. I really love going to Jordan's classes. He is the best instructor there - he just gives out great energy through out class that I haven't noticed in other instructors. his music selection, volume level of music, and loud voice tone all compliment him as a perfect yoga teacher in my eyes.  I bought the 30 class package and as long as he continues to teach there, I will continue to practice there.   Thank you Jordan and Sumit!  p.s. - I also like that the floors are wood instead of carpet.
5 I've had chronic pain in my neck and back for a number of years, that has proven to be debilitating at times. My brother recommended Kim, as she completely cured his pain. I've done physio in past, as well as chiro, accupuncture, and she is the only treatment that has been a success. She's always incredibly kind (and funny!) I'm so thankful I've found her!
5 Sawana is a great massage therapist!! She has a beautiful energy combined with her extensive skills I am thrilled to have her business in our community.  Her flexible hours make it possible for me book my appointments easily around my crazy schedule.
1 Do not go to this doctor. I went in because I was having some issues and they had me wait 2 HOURS to see the doctor WITH an appointment. When my results came in they assured me that I did not need an appointment to get my results back. But I waited THREE HOURS for them to tell me everything came back normal. They told me they were going to send me to see a specialist.( did not get a call back until two weeks later to see the specialist). What I do not understand is that every time I'm there I wait a minimum of two hours and I'm seen by the doctor in just half an hour. I do not know what the staff is doing but they are making their patients wait hours just to be told nothing is wrong.  I transferred to a new doctor and got to see a specialist the next day.
4 The Doctors and staff are knowledgeable, efficient, and caring. My husband has gone through years of misdiagnosis and treatment with no results. Once his Piriformis Syndrome was properly diagnosed he still couldnt find the correct physical therapy office and regimen. Dr. Burton listened and understood his condition and now, finally, he is seeing some results.
5 Ryan is the only physiotherapist that has been able to help me manage my chronic lower back and neck pain. What I found to be unique and effective is Ryan's use of manual Physiotherapy techniques that incorporate the use of hands to stimulate the tissue, muscles, etc. In addition, he is very pleasant and makes what is often a painful process, more lighthearted and positive.   After multiple visits to other physiotherapists that simply attached me to a stimulation machine and showed me exercises, I can safely say that Symmetry is a great place for treatment. I highly recommend those who need physical therapy go to Symmetry Physiotherapy!
5 For ANYONE who needs help for injury Rehabilitation, PT, or Chiropractic Treatment, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you visit  Healthsource of Chandler, South!  I had several bad experiences and I was Nervous about finding  a new Chiropractor. A friend at work recommended I try this the Healthsource of Chandler South location. I now am a Very Satisfied Patient!  I met with Dr David and I was immediately put at ease. He took time for a thorough consultation and I knew I had found my new Chiropractor! He took X-rays and explained my issues of early spine degeneration and issues at L4-L5 (If I remember correctly), :). He recommended a treatment plan and I Signed Up!  It turns out my Work Habits and Poor Posture over many years had caused spinal mis-alignment and needed treatment. I learned that many people, especially those that sit for hours at a computer, tend to develop issues in the back and neck.  We began a course of rehabilitation of my back.    My back in now MUCH BETTER, and  I have learned how to make simple changes in Works Habits and Posture and take better care of my back.  Of course, I felt So Good that I got back on the tennis court and played 3+ hours straight. It was AWESOME right up until my shoulder was hurting and my arm just about Fell out of the Socket........!!!-   I am such an Idiot! .............. Having just turned 50, I am finally just starting to learn that I can't just jump out there and play like I did when I was younger!    I needed HELP- again!  So, next I met with Patty,  a very encouraging and skilled Physical Therapist. She very patiently helped my arm and shoulder heal and I am now out playing tennis 2 times a week!  From the moment I arrived I was met with Courteous Service by the whole staff.   Many thanks to, Stephanie, Spencer, Beverly, Mike, Amanda and the entire staff at Healthsource.  Thank you ALL for helping me HEAL!  For ANYONE who needs help for injury Rehabilitation, PT, or Chiropractic Treatment, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you visit  Healthsource of Chandler, South!
3 Doesn't answer the phone.  While at a referred specialist there was an issue with Dr. Fihns referral.  Specialists staff and I each held on the phone for more than 30 minutes with Dr Fihns office to resolve it and never got through.  This was mid day during the week.  Pick up the phone and speak to your patients!
3 I have cycled a lot of places over the years including Lifetime, 24 hour, Mtnside, Studio 360, Madison Improvement, Core Balance to name a few. Below is my review of Forza.   Pros: Bikes are nice, and likely really preferred by cyclist who road ride.  The owner is a kind lovely woman Studio is clean and well kept  Cons: They leave florescent office lighting on the entire class (not traditional to cycle classes) The music was not loud like traditional cycle studios, nor was it current music The energy of the teacher was rather low, not very motivational  Final thoughts:  The bikes are not typical spin studio bikes, so if you are used to normal spin studio bikes these might take some getting used to. If you are a road ride enthusiast this is the studio for you, if you prefer the inside traditional cycling "spinning" type class, this is not for you.
5 Dr. Goodrick and all the RNs here genuinely care about every patient who walks in the door. It is never an easy decision to walk through the door and everyone at the clinic understands the difficulty and how strong our patients are simply by being here. We all strive to provide our patients with the best possible care, and do our best to work with them to ensure that they will receive the time and care they each individually need. Not only do we provide abortion care, but we provide different forms of birth control, and 90% of our patients walk out of the clinic on some form of birth control.
5 Without the help of Myodetox, I wouldn't have been able to persevere and progress in my fitness goals. I injured my lower back a few years ago from performing deadlifts, and was told by my family doctor that the injury would forever restrict my training, especially in the lower back which I was advised to avoid training completely. I was told that I would ultimately have to accept the fact that my back was injured and not much could be done to treat it.   Luckily with the help of another passionate gym-goer, I was referred to Myodetox. I was told they performed wonders with rehabilitation regarding gym related injuries, as they're marketed to combine methods of chiropractic treatments, physiotherapy, and massage therapy. I was referred to Boris who upon our first appointment, was quick and alert to understand what my issues were, and educated me about my injury and the treatments which were going to be done in order to remedy the injury. After just a few sessions comprised of treatment and performing instructed exercises at home on my end, I was able to deadlift again! Soon enough, I was able to resume my training regime normally, and I couldn't have been happier as this went against the belief of my family doctor!  If you have any concerns regarding your bodily functions, whether it's a gym related injury, tense parts of your body, or even require a posture alignment, the team at Myodetox quite literally has your back, and is more than competent at attending to and finding remedies for whatever concerns you may have. The analogy I like to think of for Myodetox treatments are if we're cars and the treatments are like service check-ups, cars can't keep running properly without proper tuning and service maintenance, so it's important we attend to and maintain our bodies in order to live healthily while performing movements in a pain-free manner. Definitely check out Myodetox if you have any bodily function concerns, as they do indeed perform wonders! I've been visiting them for a few years now and look forward to future sessions!
3 I saw a P.A named Micole She was nice and attentive I woke up with my eye swollen shut turns out I had a clogged gland I think She did well
5 I have been going to Desert Mountain for 5 years now and have had nothing but the best service. They listen to your concerns and put a plan together for your specific needs. Everyone that works there is great!
5 Dr. Rudd is amazing! I have a history of neck pain and I've been to many chiropractors in my life. Over the last decade, I have had the hardest time finding a chiropractor that could adjust my neck. I found Dr. Ryan and he can adjust my neck so well every single time!!! Better than anyone else ever has! I am so grateful to have found him! He is such an overall friendly, funny & genuine person.
5 I've been coming here for about 2 years.  They are always professional, kind, and hygienic.  I feel very well cared for.
1 27 days after my surgery I go on and see a gentleman named Brad takes off my splint I set an appointment for this guy to days prior like my pain level is on a scale from 1 to 10 I'm at a nine and it hurts and I'm not a person with a low pain tolerance I have a pretty high pain tolerance and I go to the court Institute for help because they're supposed to help me with a pain management but I am questioned about me having pain like as if I don't have it and he's willing willing to give me something that I know would not work for myself and apparently it upset me because my pain tolerancAt the most is unbearable but I am very dissatisfied with this placee
5 Great results with Dr. Hamic for my son Carson's football-related back injury.  He is very knowledgeable about the injuries and challenges that are unique to specific sports and player positions.  He provided exercises to do between sessions that kept Carson rapidly progressing while still sidelined by the injury.  Dr. Hamic understood the desire to get back on the field as quickly as possible.  Carson was healthy and ready to compete after 3.5 weeks of PT.  He was back to training at optimal/improved performance levels by week 6, even stronger than before the injury.  Great central Tempe location, we highly recommend this clinic.
5 I've been a patient of Dr Levitt's since she was working for Thomas Davis in the '90's.  I'm a nurse by profession for 34 years & know many doctors. I continue to stay with Dr Levitt because of her experience, thoroughness, bedside manner & endearing personality. She always takes time for me & my symptoms. I highly recommend her & her staff to my friends & co-workers. Kudos to you  Dr Levitt for helping not only myself but all of the patients under your care.  J. Russell
1 The staff is absolutely terrible. Wait times are at a minimum 30 minutes. I was told yesterday during a routine physical, which I had to wait 45 minutes to get into, to come back tomorrow fasting for blood work. I was told that the lab opens at 7:30. We arrived at 7:45. After waiting more than 30 minutes, I asked what the delay was. It turns out that they didn't have the paperwork. Why did I have to ask them after a 30 minute wait? Couldn't they have told me immediately? Why was the paperwork not ready when they knew I was coming back first thing in the morning? Other issues are that mssages don't get related to the doctors. The staff is not very friendly at all. They act as If their job is the absolute worst job a person could possibly have. Do they hate people? If it wasn't for doctor Smith, I would never come back.
1 I have been coming here for about six months and it is just a regular disorganized medical office. I hope this review gets posted, a few months ago I did a review and it was posted for a few weeks but it is no longer here.  Last time I gave it two stars but this time it is one star because there is no zero.  First thing, there is absolutely no privacy, the staff discusses the medical problems in front of everybody and the front desk lady shouts  regularly loudly at old people without regard to their feelings and conditions.  She also shouted at me very rudely as soon as mentioned I have been waiting for over 45 minutes.  It took at least 4 months to get approval of insurance company for a simple medication.  Finally, I called the insurance company and found out that they never requested the approval of the insurance company, finally I took it in my self and it was immediately approved.  Dr. Sbieh did not even acknowledge the staff short comings when I asked her later on about the problem and more than that she blamed me that I want the work being done so fast.  Is four month long enough to fax two pages to insurance company?  I will never come back here after today being shouted at in the middle of waiting room which she humiliated me in from of all who were waiting.  Doctor, teach your staff better manors and some organization.  Again it is not getting posted so what is going on.
5 Best doctors office i have ever been to. They make you feel comfortable and not intimidated at all. And they know what they are doing. Best help i have ever had.
5 Toronto Housecalls is awesome. I'm a huge fan of Doctor home visit service, if I can't see my regular family doctor because it's after hours or weekends, I would much rather wait with my kids at home instead of a crowded walk-in with other sick people sharing germs. I've used another service for years, but, unhappy with their service, decided to try Toronto Housecalls out. I am so happy I did, and I've used the service three times now.  Their doctors are friendly and knowledgeable. I am really happy to have discovered them and highly recommend Toronto Housecalls.
1 First the good: The facility looked clean and the staff at the desk were respectful if not helpful.  Now the bad: Beware if their third party advertising.  They called me and offered a free adjustment. When I arrived in was told that I didn't have an appointment.  When I explained that I had been called and had set up the appointment through the caller, I was told they use a third party advertiser and they had not set up the appointment. The office refused to honor the offer.   Basically, wasted an hour of my time and wouldn't take responsibility for their or their advertiser's mistake.
5 The facility is new, clean and neat, and more importantly, everyone is very friendly and nice - from the people at the front desk to the nurses who takes your vitals to the doctors. I have seen both Dr. Bartee-Allen (female) and Dr. DeSena (male), and both were incredibly nice. You hear so much about doctors rushing through exams, but they both took the time to sit down, chat with me, make sure all of my questions were answered, and talk through my options. They are sympathetic and informative at the same time.   They have an urgent care within the same building, and it is staffed by their own doctors, which is nice for the times when you decide you need to get checked out right away but still want to go somewhere familiar.
5 Good nice and friendly staff. Allways pleased to help. l recommend them highly
1 Went to Allied Clinic back in April of 2015 the Nurse Practitioner didn't really seem very experienced nor did the woman at the front desk.  I had asked the receptionist to call Aetna to make sure my insurance was in network with Allied Clinic, she said yes I paid my co-pay, waited 20 minutes to see the Nurse Practitioner, and got my prescription thinking I was good to go...  After a few months I get a letter from my insurance company saying Allied Clinic is out-of-network!!  I am working on my second appeal with my insurance company.  I don't think it is fair that I was told I was in network with my insurance when in reality I was not!!  Here' the kicker a co-worker went to the same clinic and Aetna covered her claim...  Anyone reading this do your own research never put your trust with the receptionist.  Make sure your insurance carrier is in network before you make that appointment.
5 I was referred here after an accident.  Great staff.. happy, knowledgable, friendly, caring, clean..would definitely recommend!
5 I went to try this therapy with my family. Was nice because with four pods we could get an appointment at the same time. Had such a great sense of "well being" after my session! Slept like a rock that night!! Highly recommend!!
1 This place seems to be nothing more than an elaborate scam to charge your insurance company as much as possible via multiple scheduled visits for the same or slightly different issues, and funneling patients through a mill and into their approved "physical therapy" partners.  They even go so far as to have another "company" on the same floor to do specific X-Rays despite clearly having the same staff working at both offices.    Don't come here if you want a legitimate answer, or legitimate help.  They'll only end up charging you and your insurance company a ton of money, and writing a generic "prescription" for physical therapy.  Complete and total waste of time, and a rip off.
5 Great staff and fellow customers.  Good classes by Laura and Devin.   Easier parking now that the construction in the parking lot  area is done.
1 Worst health care I have ever had. The staff has very little knowledge about basic medical practices  and they do not even take the time to truly address your health needs. It is convenient, but convenience is not the most important thing when it comes to health care. I recommend you find a regular doctors office before you go to this office. If it is an urgent situation there are plenty of urgent care offices that would have better medical treatment. If you don't trust my opinion ask any legitimate doctor and they will have very similar feed back. My dr now is trying to turn health care into a fast food type of business. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.
5 I met Inna a few years ago at Goodlife fitness in one of the group workout classes and since then she has been my favourite fitness instructor. As a very experienced fitness instructor, Inna has often given me advice about fitness and physical health in general. Knowing that Inna is very knowledgable and professional, I was very excited to find out that Inna is also an RMT. To alleviate my muscle tension, trigger points and stress, Inna did a combination of deep tissue and relaxation massage. The atmosphere was very relaxing with soothing music. After the full body massage, I felt like I could breathe easier and I slept like a baby! I definitely recommend her as she knows her stuff!
1 This gym starting going down hill since Golds started the $10 month to month. Since EOS took it over it has progressively gotten worse. Machines that are broke for several weeks, blown speakers that play only static on their stereo, no attachments for cable machines, unfriendly staff late at night, unless you are a particular skin color, etc etc , etc.....Late at night I would feel like I am working out in a prison yard!!! I have been a member of Golds since 2001, but have had enough.
5 I have been a patient of Dr. Coy for 2 plus years now.  Every time I am treated with respect and seen in a timely manner. I have had 4-5 different doctors in my life and Dr Coy is by far the most consistent and as long as I am a resident of Las Vegas he will continue to be my primary.  Brandon Sevruk
5 Came here today, after I left We Care Urgent Care on 75th and T-bird, front desk person was rude there.  Came in here and hearing "Welcome to Urgent Care Extra" was a breath of fresh air, I know it doesn't sound like much, but after walking in at the other one and not being acknowledged this seemed great.  Service was friendly and with a smile, waited shortly and saw Dr. Parker.  The appt. was $135 rather than $90 at the other place, but didn't even care it was worth it. I live in CA so my insurance didn't work, which I knew but will get that money back later from my Kaiser insurance.  Will recommend to family and friends.
4 Staff is nice. Facilities are modest and clean. Location and hours are very convenient.
2 First to be fair, the doctor we saw was extremely thorough. The issue was the overall service. We were the second appt of the day and arrived on time. The doctor was already 35 minutes late and then once that consult was done we waited another 15 minutes to get the shots and another 10 to get what we needed. In total we were at the clinic for 1 hour and 40 minutes!  Give yourselves tons of time if you go.
1 The worst dr. experience(s) I have ever had. Unethical, unprofessional, and just plain rude.   First: While in my appointment with Dr. Shotton: He didn't listen to my concerns; he wrote a prescription and didn't explain it at all. He insisted that 15 years worth of asthma diagnosis was probably wrong because I didn't have any wheezing during the appointment (and then he went on to bill the insurance company saying I had asthma as a pre-existing condition). He left the room without any good-bye so that i didn't realize he wouldn't be coming back. I had to send a nurse to bring him back so that I could bring up another concern of mine. He wanted me to make a second appointment (which would be fair if he wasn't so rude about it) and I told him that frankly I couldn't afford one and that I was having severe pain that limited my ability to walk. He told me that frankly he couldn't afford to spend any more time on me (after a 15 minute appointment).   Second: Prior to the appointment I had asked how much the appointment would be because I was paying out of pocket. I was told they had no idea but it would maybe be around $100. It was $250.  Third: Several months after this appointment I had another concern. I called the office and asked to make an appointment with Dr. Padilla. I explained that I had previously seen Dr. Shotton but that it wasn't a good fit and so I wanted to see someone else instead. I decided to try this place again because they already had all of my information on file and I thought maybe my first experience was a fluke.   I was told that they before they would book an appointment, they needed to call my old doctor (Dr. Shotton) for permission. I told them that it wasn't any of his business and as far as I was concerned he was no longer my doctor and had no need to know anything about my current concerns. They insisted it was company policy and would call me back once they got his permission. This is HIGHLY unethical, and I think might even be illegal.   Finally, they called me back and left a voicemail. I have since tried calling on 3 different days. Each time, a machine picked up and told me to hold. i was on hold for over 15 minutes each time. I still haven't gotten through. I'm now going to find a different medical center and a different doctor.  I would NOT recommend this place to anyone. Perhaps the other doctors are better but the bs you have to go through with Desert View makes it not worthwhile.
5 Jim is the best masseur I have ever seen. He's very knowledgeable in his massage techniques and in muscle release. I had a lower back problem for several years and his sessions helped reduce my pain and eventually make it go away completely. He excels at finding the tense places in the neck shoulders and hips and releasing them. He's a great sports massage therapist, and knows deep tissue, trigger point, and cranial sacral techniques. The combined styles he uses works better than any one massage technique I've tried in the past.    He's very flexible with scheduling, and works late nights so when I can't make it in the evening I can usually get my massage at night. Though he does out calls, I always went to him because he has a spa next to the massage room that I can relax in and warm up before he works on me, which makes the massage much more effective and gives quicker results.
5 Dr. Riley has been my doctor for 15 years.  He is such a caring, competent doctor - I can't imagine going to any other medical practices.  His staff is very nice and really good about working with your schedule to get you in as soon as possible.   I really appreciate all he has done for our family.  And I would highly recommend him to anyone looking for a great doctor!
2 Went in last week Monday (7/10/17) as I'd been feeling ill for two weeks.  Had 13 vials of blood drawn and was told they'd contact me with the results.  Well here I am a week later, still feeling ill, called in to check on my results and nobody has bothered to read them yet.
5 Dr Tafreshi is great! I'm new to LV and I needed a PCP. Saw the good reviews on Yelp. Thought I'd give them a try.   Good decision! The staff is friendly. I highly recommend Dr. Tafreshi and his group!
1 The receptionist's demeanor was very rude and unpleasant... enough for me to reconsider and not come into this office.  I explained that I have flu-like symptoms, maybe mild pneumonia and had some chest pain.. nothing that some antibiotics couldn't cure, in my opinion.  The receptionist's demeanor was rude and just told me to go to the emergency room, but then says "Still want to make an appointment with the doctor?"  Doesn't make a whole lot of sense after you just told me I should go to the emergency room.  Not everyone has the luxury of waiting around in the emergency room.  Plus, the emergency room is very, very expensive.  Reading other people's reviews.. I guess this place just specializes in drawing blood?  So yeah.. I didn't get a chance to meet the doctor.
5 Ok...it's a County Hospital...I get that...but it is difficult for me to understand some of the negative comments (am wondering if some are from friends of competing hospitals...or mayb just a bit negative by nature?).  My experience at UMC has been excellent (not "as good as it gets as in Perfecto"...but exceptional nonetheless). one morning at 3:30am I needed to be driven to the ER here...and the RN's and the MD's were true servant leaders who all deserve a medal with appreciation and respect.
5 Awesome place and Kris is great! He knows his stuff and is always on point with everything. Every time I leave I'm so much better and he keeps up with my day to day boxing strains. I would recommend him to anyone and everyone with any kind of pain.
5 If you have torn muscles or in my case need help with mobility you need to call functional perfornance. The office staff will make you feel welcomed and will review insurance options. They are professional and a pleasure to deal with. My physical therapist is sara and she is amazing .she is patient , listens and will research methods to help you. I have a mobility problem and i cant thank her enough. The place is clean the equipment is top notch. Thank you sara and functional performance for allowing me to be a client.
1 I have been to physical therapy before in another state, so I knew what to expect heading into therapy. Unfortunately, nothing was right about this facility.   I wanted someone to take my back problems (a herniated disc) seriously and work hard with me to correct them. I am young, and I was willing to put in the effort, but no one really seemed to have the desire to spend any time working with me. While I understand that no one is going to be at my side every moment that I am in therapy, I expect more than ten minutes (literally) of time with an actual therapist if I am going to be in the facility for an hour and a half. For the vast majority of my 7 visits to this facility I was left to my own devices, doing simple things that I could be doing and home (calf raises, riding a bike, etc.). And, the stretches that I was asked to do (not by the therapists, but by techs, who are not educated in PT) were not explained to me, so I did not know how I should be correctly stretching to avoid injuring myself further or actually potentially help myself heal (my massage therapist had to actually explain their stretches to me when I went to see her - I was doing most of them wrong).   Between stretches, I had to proactively go find a tech and ask what to do next, because they were always busy talking among themselves, watching TV, or otherwise entertaining themselves. It is also pretty important that, if you're working in a PT facility, you have an actual education and degree in PT. Tim Soder has an abundance of techs (ie, "assistants" who are on-the-job trained) doing the majority of his work. Because I had concerns with the way my therapy was being handled, I have consulted a number of therapists who have confirmed that this is not how a therapy business should be run, and professionals in this business don't have a lot of respect for those who hire techs without therapy degrees to work with their patients.   In summary, most of the staff members I encountered were very nice, but I would not recommend this place if you're looking for a great professional environment to help you get  back on your feet quickly from an injury.
5 I'm sure that Jim can give a great 'light' massage, but can't imagine why anyone would want one. The deep muscle work that he does is fantastic - hurts so good! - and his tableside manner is friendly and relaxing. The fact that he'll come to your house and rub your back (very affordably) when you feel too crappy to drive to his place is the clencher.
5 After over a week of sinus pressure I decided to go to urgent care. This place was extremely clean and the staff was very friendly. I saw Dr. Johnston who was great. I would recommend this urgent care to everyone.
5 I've been seeing Dr. Fischbeck for just under two years.  I am very happy with the care and treatment I've received.  Weather it's a last minute trip for stitches or to remove a piece of a broken needle from my foot (both my fault) or a regular check up, I am always able to get in quickly.  The staff is kind and attentive and the medical care is always given with a very human and compassionate feel.  I also love how, when necessary, Dr. Fischbeck tells it like it is.  He knows when to be blunt and when a little TLC is needed.   They also recently remodeled their office which makes it a much more open and welcoming environment.  I will keep going Dr. Fischbeck and would recommend his office to anyone looking for a great family practice physician.
5 Jon has been my primary stretch therapist for over 10 years and I can not say enough positive things about his performance and ability. His skill set and technical experience is superior to his peers. As a certified trainer he has likely trained most others in his specific field so I would recommend Jon over any other. He frequently works on NFL and professional sports players which is another testimonial to his high level of experience. Jon is your guy if you want it done right.
5 I went to this office for the first time today and loved it. Front desk lady very helpful and pleasant and the Nurse practitioner spoke to me with such compassion. Definitely returning
1 Saw Dr. Cummings. He had me totally confused with another pt. Was loud in the halls. I knew everything about every patient while I was waiting. Sent me to the worst physical therapist ever! Andy who owns Frogs PT (should have known with a rediculous name like that). Mri totally inconsistent with findings and he never ordered a 2nd with contrast which showed 3 labral tears and loose hardware. He's too distracted. Keep looking, ortho surgery is too serious to not get it right.
5 Dr. Levins has been my primary care physician for the last three years, and he has been fantastic.  Every time that I go in for a check-up, it is an enjoyable time.  The staff are friendly, and it does not take a long time to be seen by the doctor himself.  If you are looking for a good doctor who will take care of you and actually care about your needs, come give Dr. Levins a visit.  I'm sure you will find him one of the best doctors that you have ever seen.
5 Dr Patel has saved my life!  He has helped me regulate many unpleasant symptoms and radically improve my overall health.  He has employed both holistic and western medicine and I feel better than I did even when I was 20 years younger!  Cannot recommend him more!
1 The reception is very rude and unfriendly ! They are careless about patient ! When I called them to talk with my family Doctor, they hanged up my phone when I was still talking on the phone !
4 I was pretty happy with Northeast Family Medicine, as a source for basic healthcare and access to a primary care physician, only about one mile from where I was living.  I've been getting my primary healthcare through the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics for nearly 40 years now, and like being close to one of their clinics offering general medical practice services.  I've been cared for by the "Orange Team," and had a couple male physicians who were quite good, and with whom I developed a good rapport.  When they both moved on with their careers last year, I dreaded the need to find another competent physician with whom I would "click."  Then I got lucky and discovered Emily Jewell, a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine, and I could not be happier.  She always takes enough time to listen to what I've got to say, clearly genuinely cares about me and my health, and played an essential role in finally getting my back problem accurately diagnosed by ordering an MRI done, which revealed two herniated discs.  Although a move in 2015 made me now 7 miles away, I still use Northeast as my source for basic healthcare, and continue to be pleased with everything about it, except how busy my doctor is.  Sometimes it will take a while before I can get an appointment, but if I'm in a rush, I can opt to see someone else on the Orange Team, or request to be put on a call list for cancellations, or both.
5 I requested an appointment this morning before the clinic opened as my neck had seized up and I was in considerable pain. Dr. Huang emailed me within minutes and met me within an hour. He talked me through his diagnosis and how he would treat my issue. It's been a few hours since the treatment and I can move again. A fantastic experience.
5 Obi at Fusion Kinetics is a great trainer and motivator and really cares about what my true goals are. I gained alot of weight after I had my daughter and before I knew it- 2 years flew by and I was 73lbs  heavier. I tried working out on my own, going to boot camp classes and I even tried getting a personal trainer at Goodlife. Nothing worked until I came to Obi. He has a way of getting into your head and really finding out the real reason for my weight gain and before I knew it I was loosing weight at a surprising rate. I lost the 80lbs I gain and an addition 15lbs after that. With his app I was able to go back to previous workouts we did and workout when I'm away from Toronto for work which makes it so much easier. I also love his support staff and how they are available to me at any hour of the day or night to guide me through food decisions and cravings.
2 Good doc. Really like her. But 3+ hour wait times with apt. Literally. And no longer take credit cards for payments. Only cash. Unfortunately can't spend hours waiting for appointments.
4 Everyone here was great! It took a long time - 1 1/2 hours from start to finish - but it was because they were busy. I did not have to make an appt. People at the desk and the nurse were very friendly. Dr Ledesma was fantastic - she figured out my problem quickly and explained everything she was thinking and doing. Was quick and efficient with minor procedure. And I left with antibiotics from them so I didn't have to make another trip to pharmacy afterwards - the meds weren't too expensive from them also. This is a good clinic.
5 I just finished a few weeks with the Camelview team and they are fantastic across the board.  I always got direct service from Linda all the way through, or sometimes she had her staff finish up and they were great, I always felt like is was in professional hands.  I saw results immediately and would recommend them highly for anyone.
5 The experience with Stephanie was fantastic. It was so relaxing and smelled so good. I feel my stomach is much firmer than before!
4 I'm usually not one to write a review about a business, but in this case it's warranted.  I have had six sessions with Tammy and I will agree sometimes I have had to wait, but it's always worth the wait!  And, she has always been very accommodating.  I'll admit I wasn't very knowledgeable about crystals and their healing powers or Chakras, and I'm still learning something new with each session.  Tammy is a very intuitive, honest, kind and helpful person.  She has helped me release some negativity from my life and with each session I'm becoming a happier person!
5 Love Dr. Ryan and Love the Results! I've had back pain for the past 34 years, with flare-ups typically occurring every 1-3 months. It was frustrating, debilitating, and depressing! I've been going to Dr. Ryan since May 2014 and I am thrilled to say that I have not had ONE flare-up since. Not one! I'm sold and will be a patient for life. Gentle, caring, and effective - doesn't get ANY better than that! Thanks Dr. Ry!
5 I e-mailed the Cloud Care Clinic because I had several questions about their services. Dr. Frank Nhan responded to my message within 24 hours and addressed all my questions. Dr. Frank Nhan was professional, approachable and kind. Good customer service is hard to come by these days, so I really commend them for taking care of their customers.
5 Dr. Max is is very thoughtful and very friendly. I have been going here for years and it's always very welcoming. I always know I'll be taken care of in the right way. It's comforting to know that after doing the doctor search for a number of years that I can go somewhere that I trust.
5 I gave birth to both of my sons here and it was amazing. The rooms are big and they are very accommodating. I had no problems with the staff and their nurses treated my sons wonderfully. Thank you!
1 The Drs are decent and if you want to spend your entire day listening to "when will they call me?" "How long has it been?" This would be a good place for you. When we started coming here they were good they'd call you back within a few minutes of your appointment time. But the last 4 times (idk why I haven't learned yet and switched drs) we've been waiting at least an hour past our appointment time. And if your lucky that's all you have to wait. We've been called back after an hour waited another 30 minutes for the dr and then another 15-30 minutes for paperwork. Really need to get finding a new dr.
5 From Stacy, the owner, to the front office, Spectrum is a class organization. My wife and I have both had PT here. My wife is in a walker due to an accident in surgery over seven years ago. The entire staff has been caring and compassionate with her. Stacy is always personally concerned about my wife. Angelica is an amazing physical therapist. Everyone has been very professional and cared about our progress. If you enjoy a competent, personal touch, you need go no further than Spectrum Spine and Sports.
5 Great passionate staff here with extensive knowledge on therapy. Any issues would be taken care of immediately, would highly recommend.
5 Took two classes at Bikram Yoga Tempe and found the facilities and instructors to be top notch. Facilities were very clean and both teachers for my classes were great. The "carpet" is really cool in the yoga room...more like a fuzzy, grippy mat. The humidifier did a pretty good job for Arizona...nothing like Texas where humidity is natural, but enough to make it a nice sweaty class.
5 I highly recommend this office! I recently moved from central Illinois and had to find a new chiropractor when I got here. I have to say that I feel like I lucked out finding this place. Dr. Grant does an excellent job with his adjustments and I am very particular when it comes to getting a good adjustment. The staff is friendly and helpful. Previous Dr.'s I have seen only gave me the adjustment and maybe a roller bed after. Dr. Grant's office does so much more. If you've been looking for a great chiropractor, check this place out!
5 This was the best experience I have ever had at an urgent care. I waited for about two minutes in the waiting room and five minutes to see the PA. This was by far the best staff I have ever seen in a urgent care center.  My only concern is after reading some other reviews that they might not bill my insurance company correctly.
5 Dr. Steven is awesome! I've been to many Chiropractic offices and for the first time in a long time I feel comfortable and am on the road to recovery! I've had sever back issues that escalated to the point where I couldn't pick up my 7lb newborn daughter. It was very painful physically and emotionally. A month ago I finally made the choice that enough was enough and I gave Global a shot. My first appointment consisted of X-Rays, an adjustment, and I was asked questions about my life style. I'll never regret the choice I made to come to Global. I feel like my old self! I've been able to get back into my normal routine of working out and being active with my spouse. Dr. Steven and his staff are upbeat, kind, and welcome you by name and with genuine smiles. You can tell right away they love what they do. Stop by and just hang out and you will see that this is the place where you need to be to get better.
2 I thought this was going to be my primary care physician but after trying to schedule an appointment the other day I've decided to look elsewhere.  My first visit I scheduled a few days out as a new patient, had little wait time and actually spoke with the doctor for more than 5 minutes.  I liked that they had the portal to message back and forth with any follow up questions as well and I even referred several clients of mine to their office because of how impressed I was with how well I was treated by the whole office.   Unfortunately what's changed my mind is their lack of communication on how they do their scheduling of appointments.  If I had been told during my first appointment that they only took appointments 1-2 days out I would never have wasted my time or their time...with my work schedule I have to plan doctors visits out in advance (yes there are emergency situations and I appreciate that they value taking care of sick patients in need of getting in to the office in a pinch but there has to be some sort of a compromise with scheduling?!)  I called to come in for a follow up appointment and was looking to schedule it 3 days out, Julie at the front desk explained the scheduling rules and I explained to her I was not told this when I came in the first time and had made my first appointment 3 days out that time so I wasn't sure why they couldn't do it this time.  Rules are rules an she said sorry and I said I'd have to go else where then...I honestly was baffled that the conversation ended the way that it did.  Me being me decided to email the doctor through the portal thing to see if there was any way they could help with my schedule because during my first visit she had taken so much time to get to know me and seemed to understand that it was hard for me to get in to appointments at times with my work schedule, after getting her response it was made clear that rules are rules....and business must be good for them at desert ridge family physicians.    I even called the day I needed the appointment to see if I could get in at the time I needed and the time I needed wasn't available anymore, so clearly this system is not for me.  in the mean time I'm still on the hunt for finding a physician that I like.  :(  despite the fact they provide healthcare for the public they still are running a business and I just am in shock that they turned away business.  great doctors, convenient location, just wish the scheduling had been explained better and or could have been worked out better to meet my needs as a patient.
5 This was my first time here. I had an appointment for a later date but they kept me updated on their openings. I was able to get an appointment today. The staff was friendly and made me feel comfortable. They were very attentive. I would recommend this office to anyone who would ask.
5 Mrs. Nicky Baby! Ladies with a hundred plus degree weather and the need to have your summer body well maintained, it a Must you go see Nicky because every girl needs a B 12 pick me up in this heat! And loosing a few extra pounds is always a good idea.
1 You guys aren't going to get your money. I need to speak to a case manager as soon as possible.
5 Excellent therapists and staff. Very easy to work with. I highly recommend them for any physical therapy needs.
1 Do not go to this PT place! I was 1 1/2 weeks post-op ACL surgery on my knee and they nearly tore my ACL graft. They were way too aggressive with me and forced my knee into flexion and I screamed in so much pain that I saw stars and could not catch my breath. Tom, the owner, after he saw what happened, tried to act like it was OK. Although his face said otherwise, he knew the therapist had really messed up. He said, just "ice it a lot at home". My knee swelled up like a watermelon and my orthopedic surgeon was livid. In addition, the place is dirty, they are not meticulous about cleaning the tables and equipment between clients. The therapists don't wash their hands often. The therapists are overworked with too many clients. Tom is on his cell phone all the time, not the least bit interested in the clients or actually supervising anything. Needless to say, after being traumatized by this place, I went to another PT place that was excellent, caring, thoughtful and clean. Don't go here, especially if you are post-surgery.
2 I have been treated fairly and feel confident with seeing the PA's, as no Dr. is actually on staff. But, I have tried to be patient, waiting for a requested referral, but after TWO MONTHS, they still have not completed their job.  This is the third time referral issues have occurred. Heaven forbid if I would have had an ailment that required immediate action!
1 The billing dept. are a bunch of idiots who don't know what they're doing. If you bring your baby or kids there be prepared to pay outrageous bill thanx to the people who cant figure out insurance plans. HORRIBLE....... ESPECIALLY THE LADY WHO TAKES CARE OF BILLING. Beware
4 My dad was admitted here for muscle weakness thought due to his cholesterol medication. He had a private room and was treated with dignity and respect. When he was transferred from one wing to another, the staff came to visit him in his new room to check on him. My mom was able to spend the night the entire time he was there. My parents said the nurses and therapists were friendly, motivating and supportive.   My only concerns were that I requested a neuro consult (which he received). The neurologist in his consult suggest that he have an EMG study in his office while he was a patient there. My dad was told that Medicare would not pay for this. No kidding, the hospital would have to pay for transportation. (Being in the medical field, I'm not stupid). Also, he was place on ASA 81 and he would bruise easily. He has thin skin and he would get skin tears easily. The doctor said he was going to switch him to Plavix! WTF?! Thank God my mom spoke up and told the doctor and my dad her experience with Plavix. So my dad refused that medication while he was there.  When he was discharged, the case manager was very thorough with my requests. Including an order for neuro follow up, home health, DME, etc. The pharmacist and the nurse were very helpful and asked if he had any questions before he left.  Thank you all for taking good care of my Daddy. Even though he was stubborn at first, you guys did great. Most importantly, my dad got stronger (modified independent) and my parents were happy with the care you provided!
1 I loved this office actually what my fuss is how you miss an appointment and they terminate you from receiving care here which pisses me off when if you are getting paid why does it matter that you miss appointments it ain't like that should Matter stupid ass appointment makers
5 Oh how I enjoy escaping my troubles and worries at Zen! The hour massage is wonderful and at $49, you can't beat it. Last Christmas, I purchased the buy two get 30 minutes free. I gifted one hour and kept an hour for myself. As an educator, I keep stress in my shoulders. My assigned massage therapist always works out those knots without me asking. The staff is very professorial and I highly recommend Zen!
1 First experience was a disaster! A nurse practitioner came to house. Ok, but not knowledgeable. She ordered labs for my wife, next day girl from lab calls and states she has a emergency and cannot come for a couple weeks! We ask can't you send someone else and she said no works for herself. Then we had a nebulizer that the nurse ordered delivered and it was the wrong one. Home delivery company said we received what she ordered. Called my doctors now and they said would need to Wait a until next week to get someone else to fix it!!! Do not call My Doctor Now!!! C grade at best!
5 Dr. Chris is a great chiropractor. He has adjusted me several times and I always feel like he addresses all of my concerns. I've been adjusted by many different chiopractors and Dr. Chris is one of the best. Thanks Dr. Chris!
5 I feel the same  way like Lori about Dr. Ramsey and her team if not more. She is outstanding at what she does and so much compassion and energy and integrity. She is so knowledgable in preventive care and helps you get back to health. She has helped me tremendously and I give her an A+ (5star). You can tell she enjoys sharing her knowledge. I'm so great full for meeting with her. Your life from A to Z is very smart for having her on the show and I thank them for that.
5 I have tried many different types of bodywork over the past 2 decades; Structural Integration, Cranial Sacral Therapy, Shiatsu, Hot Stone Therapy, Acupuncture, Occupational Therapy and many more than I care to list.  I was curious about this style of Myofascial Release and how my body would respond to it.  The way Rowena explained it to me was that this type of bodywork "triggers the body's own healing response." She also encouraged me to learn more about what she does before she ever laid a hand on me.  I have NEVER in all my years had a therapist encourage me to learn the way she has.  After doing a great deal of research I was sold, still not knowing exactly what to expect I scheduled my first session with her.   The warm inviting atmosphere at Body Resonance put me at ease immediately.  As I expected it was filled with all kinds of; educational materials regarding Myofascial Release, self treatment tools, and even some very high quality essential oils from Doterra. When I was greeted by Rowena I felt a powerful healing energy from her presence and I knew that I was exactly where I needed to be.  Throughout the session she was, nurturing and powerfully attentive.  It was as if she could read me and anticipate my every need.  As she worked I could feel this intense heat pour out of her hands as if her hands were the comforting springtime sun melting the pain in my body like the last of the winter's snow.   After the session she encouraged me to take it easy and just "listen" to my body and notice how I feel.  She handed me more information about John Barnes style of Myofascial Release and how I could anticipate my healing process to proceed. She has also advised me on self treatment (which is something that I do not expect from most bodyworkers).  She truly became invested in my healing process and what's more, she clearly wants me to take an active role in my own healing.  I find that very refreshing since it seems like most Therapists just want continuous business saying to "come back at least once a month." I have seen Rowena several times since that first visit and I can't tell you how much I have learned and how the healing in my body has taken new shape. Rowena is truly amazing.
5 Impact Physical Therapy has made a huge difference in the managing of my chronic back pain. I have been to a few chiropractors and physical therapists since my auto accident in 2002. I have never had a therapist sit with you for an entire visit. After my 1st appointment I could tell a difference in the way I walked. Eric sent me home with stretches and exercises to maintain my progress. They really do care about your health and making sure that you do not have to see them for a lifetime. Thank you Impact for relieving my pain!!
1 My mother was a patient here for about 2 weeks. The nursing staff/PA  must of been "D" Students because they didn't ever have an answer for any question you asked.  I don't think any of the nurses gave a report to the next shift of nurses about their current patients - no one had any idea of what medications my mother was given and never knew if she had any tests done or any therapy. They couldnt tell me if there was any change good or bad.  The only people at this facility that did ANY WORK  were the CNA'S (aids) they worked very hard, they were thoughtful, efficient, kind and did ALL the work - unlike the nurses who were on there cell phones (texting, games, etc.) at the nurses station and RUDE when you approached them to ask for something because they were too busy to answer call light.  In case your wondering I was there 8 to 10 hours everyday.  It took me several days to get to see the Doctor in charge, I asked several times, the only  reason I got to see him was because  I caught him by accident.  I asked the Doctor about different tests he was giving my mother and I asked him if she was failing and he was very abrupt and put me off, treating me like I was over reacting - my mother died 3 weeks later - I brought her home with Hospice.  The bottom line is if you need skilled nursing care run the other way!!!  Doctor, PA, Nurses very very poor, they should be ashamed.
5 Never have I ever had a deep tissue massage like this. After a week of strenuous activities done on vacation, my dude and I were on the hunt for a good massage place. For $45 for an hour, you are getting an amazing deal!  The reviews don't lie. Jim is fantastic at what he does. This was the second time I've come in for a massage and he knows how to work out the kinks in your aching bod. He always asks for the major problem areas. If he doesn't, don't be shy to mention it to him.   He also massages the UNLV swim team on top of his private practice. Pretty impressive! When my boyfriend asked if he ever gets tired of massage person after person, he answered with a simple, "Nah!"  The only thing that might make some people feel iffy about getting a massage from him is that he does it out of a small room at his house. I can testify there is nothing to worry about here.  The dude is professional and super friendly.   I'm also grateful that he'll take you in with short notice if he has it available.
1 And now after everything they keep sending me bill, after the doctor and MA on the front office confirmed that I won't be charged for the second visit. Of course, whenever I call I get someone who has no idea how to respond to my questions and keeps promising I'll get a call back. Urgh ...
2 The part of the massage I received wasn't bad but it was INCOMPLETE. The gal, who seemed inexperienced, worked on my back forever. It seemed like she was just wasting time. She did rub my arches, which I had to ask for, but what's with massage people these days skipping the feet? Don't they know there are alot of nerve endings there that would benefit a massage? Anyway, after  turning over for the front massage, she said she didn't have any time left to do a front body massage! What, I said, I asked for a full body massage. She said sorry, out of time. Poor scheduling of time, won't go back.
5 Brent is knowledgeable and knows all about massaging and energies. He has a positive energy that feeds into his massages and was blessed to help reduce the pain in my back that I've had for months.  His prices are the best around too! I will be returning to Bold Bodywork for future massages and I have already referred my mom and aunt. Thanks Brent! I can walk tall again (as tall as a 4'10" person can walk :-)).
1 Sitting here again and it's already been 1 hr and that's with an appointment.  Love Dr.Irons but we need monthly meds and they make us come monthly when other Dr's give 3 months at a time. ..this place is the worst. ...huge waste of time, although it's conveniently located I'll be looking for a new Dr.
4 This is the only walk-in clinic my boyfriend and I use.    While you may have to wait a long time, the care we've both received here has been satisfactory.  The doctors all seem fairy knowledgable.  I fractured my tibia once and came here to have it checked out. They sent me right over to Bloor and Christie (about a block away) to get X-Rays done and called me about 3 days later with the results. That's better service than my own family doctor provides!  They also have a pharmacy located on the same floor, so you can always pick up your prescription there if need be.  I would certainly recommend this clinic if you need to see a doctor and live in the area.
5 I was traveling for work and experienced the most intense pain of my life in my lower back. Upon a friend's recommendation, I made an appointment with Dr. Dom. His staff was so friendly, helpful, and caring; I felt like they listened to me and always made sure I was as comfortable as possible. Dr. Dom spoke to me in language and terms that I could understand and took my personal history and current pain situation into account before making a diagnosis and setting forth a treatment plan. He used all of the tools at his disposal to help me during my 2-week stay in Phoenix. My only regret is that he doesn't have an office in NYC!  I *HIGHLY* recommend Dr. Dom and his staff to anyone in need of PT, chiropractic care, or any of the services that they offer.
5 I put my vack out few months ago and decided to go see doc. dave and not only did he help with that i had a fall in 2009 in that left me with constant pain in my left neck and shoulder in which that after first visit i am able to sleep on that side and not take pain  meds I still have pain but with each visit it gets less and less as he gets me adjusted I would go no where else he individualizes his care
5 Traveling thru visiting family and got super sick. Staff was awesome and took care of my quickly. I was able to get all my scripts there which was super convenient. Hate being sick but love the superior service I received just now!
1 I waited for my appointment for 55 minutes at the new location on Washington. If it wasn't for me asking the EXTREMELY RUDE front desk staff when my therapist could take me back, the office manager/my physical therapist Suzanne wouldn't have come up and told me in person that she was running behind. Needless to say, I didn't stay for my appointment because I had to leave by the time I was told she could take me back. HUGE waste of time.   If I could give them no stars I would.
5 I have the best physical therapist, tech and intern in the world who have been assisting me through a shoulder injury.  Sean, Carlos and Mari (respectively) really help me through every move, make sure I am executing them accurately, and swiftly move me through my sets.  I am really happy with the treatment I receive at this clinic and how well I am improving.  They are also very patient with me as I tend to have to cancel a lot for various reasons.    The best part of my one and a half session is the massage by Sean or Mari!
5 These doctors deserve 10 stars!  I took my aunt here to visit the doctor and I have NEVER been so impressed with a medical practice.  Everything is perfect from the moment you walk in  - you are greeted by a very professional, efficient and welcoming staff member; the waiting room is more like a friendly sitting area than a typical doctors office and the whole office has a very warm feel where you can tell the staff and the doctors care.  THE DOCTORS ARE TOP RATE - honestly,  the doctor was so wonderful, I was blown away.  There is no where else in Las Vegas that has this quality of physician.  I have never met with a physician with such a high level of knowledge, but also with the ability to communicate that knowledge in a way that anyone can understand.  The doctor is one of those people that you would just like if you ran into whatever the place - just a nice, easy going person who is kind and caring and very likable.  It is a rare gift to find such a doctor - I have searched for years and never found one until Dr. Qamar.  I can only stress that you will never find the level of knowledge in any physician in this town - this is a whole different level of practice.  The best part of this practice is that you really get a face to face visit with a doctor - not just a doctor who grabs your file and runs in and out of your room but a doctor who knows their patients by name, knows their history well - it is like an old fashioned doctors office or a high end concierge care office where your doctor is your trusted family friend and someone who you can rely on and turn to.  I recommend this office highly.
5 I was surprised and very pleased to receive an immediate phone call from Dr. David Warkentin, CEO of Verve Wellness.  There was a gracious apology for my "crappy" experience, and the unexpected charges will be written off.  Dr. W told me a little about the history of the practice and repeatedly said that he takes reviews seriously. The dentist I saw has been counseled about his chair-side manner, and I learned about a new, highly skilled dentist who will be joining the practice I have to recant my previous review and say that I will return to Verve.
5 Dr. Christy Thomas is one of the most caring, knowledgeable health care professionals I have ever visited as a patient. She is totally  focused on the patient, spent a tremendous amount of focused time explaining why she was making suggested strategies. Her approach has changed my life. I feel a thousand times better, sleep like I never have before and just feel better about life. Thanks doc!!
5 i have seen dr. patel for over 10 years. my children and family love him. he is very caring and a really good doctor. if your tired of your old doctor this is the person to see.  .
1 do not go here!!!!! they sent in a ton of lab tests that had nothing to do with what i went in for and i had nooooo consent in taking. now i have a bill from sonora quest lab for 698.28. i have called this urgent cares billing so many times to ask them about the tests and all they say they can do is contact the doctor,  well its been since june and they still "cant" get ahold of the doctor who sent in the tests!  do not go here!!!!  if i could rate them 0 stars i would
4 Got the groupon deal for eyelash extensions. There was no wait. Took less than an hour 30-40 mins. Daisy was very nice.   Lashes look great.  Only four stars because I don't think it was 50 lashes each eye as I was told.. You can try counting and it'll only be around 30.  I've had lashes done before and those appointments took almost 2 hours.
3 I just switched my kids to this practice.  We have had several visits already and they are usually prompt.  There is a sick/well waiting room separation and they can almost always accomodate a sick kid visit with pretty short notice.  I have had good experiences with the two docs we have seen, but the nurses/assistants are a little off.  Once my twins weights/heights were switched on the charts.  I guess with two kids at a time it can get confusing, but their job is to be accurate.  They are boy/girl so that should have curbed the mistake.  The second time the nurse took my son's temp and it read 99.  His cheeks were bright red and burning to the touch.  I asked her to recheck it and she got a different thermometer and it read 102.6 degrees.    The practice does seem to be almost always available.  The Wynn location is 24/7 and though they do not have pediatrics, they are more convenient than the ER after hours.  Also, the nurse line has been pretty helpful and available.  This practice is overall much better than the practice we just left. They are big and corporate, but sometimes that works to the patients benefit.
5 I know that the providers here truly care, and that makes a big difference.  I've been to doctors that are abrupt and act bothered to take the time to listen to you or answer your questions, but the vibe here is different.  Whether it's ordering tests or explaining things to you, the doctors and PAs, I have met here have all been easy to talk to and very informative.   They are open late, take walk-ins, and even have movies playing in the exam rooms to make the wait more pleasant.  Grateful for my good experiences here.  Would definitely recommend them!
5 I had never been to a chiropractor before going to Mesa Chiropractic, but I'm so glad I tried them! I've been adjusted a few times by Dr. Eric now after some back problems due to improper rowing technique and he has helped me out so much! I could barley walk before, and after just a few sessions, not only is the pain completely gone, I am still rowing. Everyone is incredibly welcoming there and although I haven't had an adjustment by Dr. Rob, I have talked to him a couple of times and he is very warm and friendly as well.
5 I had a fantastic experience here. I went straight there after getting in a car accident and they took such good care of me. Dr. Marc and Dr. Alex are both very personable and gave me excellent exercises to help with the pain. Dr. Garret and Dr. Scott are very nice and do great adjustments. Over all I was very impressed and would highly recommend this facility.
5 While training to become a yoga teacher I felt something tear in my upper hamstring. Overdoing and over-stretching. I was an avid runner and spinner, as well, and suddenly found myself in pain every time I tried to do the activities I loved.  An ultrasound showed a pretty sizable tear in my tendon :-(    My primary doctor recommended SEMI and told me about this crazy science-fiction sounding procedure (in my opinion) called "Stem Cell PRP".  Stem cells removed from my bum would be injected into my tendon tear along with my own platelets and VOILA- the tendon would grow and repair itself within 6 months.  It seemed too good to be true.  But I was desperate to go back to a pain-free active life.    Dr. Stoddard took the time necessary to explain the procedure and walk me through recovery.  He was kind and knowledgeable and professional every step of the way.  And always responsive to my questions and concerns. It took about 6 months of physio and a break from running and high impact activities....but it actually worked!!  It worked!!!   I am now PAIN FREE!  I am running and kick boxing and stepping and spinning and I can fold forward without any pain!  As a yoga teacher, that's pretty important.  The follow up ultrasound showed my tear was completely healed.  I am so grateful to Dr. Stoddard and the team at SEMI.  It may seem like a lot of time and trouble at first glance, but take it from me--- it's soooo worth it.  6 months is a drop in the bucket compared to a lifetime of pain free movement. Thank you SEMI for giving me back my active lifestyle!
5 This was my first time ever going to physical therapy but there's no way it gets better than this place. I'm 25 and I was having constant knee pain. Knowing I didn't have an injury, I decided to seek PT to see if it would help. After my first appointment my constant pain was gone! Seriously, one appointment. My pain degraded and I was only having soreness in the knee after being active. Eric (& Frank) worked hard to identify the root of the problem and helped me strengthen those muscles to get rid of the nerve pain. They were always friendly and pleasant to work with and after 7 weeks i'm back to running and yoga with absolutely zero pain. I can't recommend them enough.
5 Everyone here is so awesome! I have to come a few times a week, but I'm not even mad because they make me look forward to my next visit.  Karrine and All the ladies are so helpful when it comes to gym time, but especially Amber because her presence is just so pleasant when she's around! Amazing vibes. I definitely bonded with Jackson since the first time I came. Thank you everyone for being so wonderful and taking care of me! I almost don't want to get better ;)
5 I am a big believer in supporting independent business owners instead of going to one of those "massage chain" places. I have been receiving massage therapy from Rebecca every  2 weeks for a couple of months now and she is hands down the best at what she does. I love Ashiatsu and she is one of the very few in Vegas that knows how to perform it.   Just today I went in with a very bad pain in my lower back. Rebecca was able to right away show me what was going on in my spine and was able to massage and stretch that area to the point that I walked out of the building pain free! Her massage techniques are spectacular, she always listens to her client's needs and whether she is using her hands or her feet anyone who goes to see her will be very happy that they did!
1 UMC has employees that work in patient service that has access to your name social security number date of birth and they steal it from you and sale it
4 I have been going to see Dr. Michael Wade for many years after he was recommended to me.  I believe that Dr. Wade is the most compassionate and caring doctor that I have ever had.  He truly cares what happens to his patients. I now recommend him to all my friends.  He calls me as soon as he receives the results of my - blood tests, x-rays - so that I don't have to wait and worry about what the results are as most of my other doctors do.  His nurse, Cindy, is also very nice and gets things done in a timely and friendly manner. When I have an appointment to see him, I never have to wait more than a few minutes.  His front office staff is very pleasant.  One of the girls at the front desk had an attitude problem a few years ago, but someone must have spoken to her because she has turned a new leaf and is now just as helpful as the rest of the staff.  My only problem is with the phone answering system.  I have never seen anything like it.  Through the years I have waited for sometimes 1/2 an hour to speak to a human.  This is uncalled for.  It never happens in any other doctor's office.  I can't imagine what the problem is.  But there is a light at the end of the tunnel.  The other day I had to call the office for a referral, and I only waited on hold for 5 minutes!  There is hope yet!
4 I've been a patient of Dr. Mark Heisler's for over 10 years.  The first time I saw him, he took the time to get to know me as a person, as well as a patient.  I am able to get in to see him when I need to and value his expertise and his advice.  He has a wonderful manner with his patients and I have referred others to him.
1 Sent me to trop office when doctor was at cheyenne location. Waited an hour to tell me he was not at that location but they can take me as a walk in if I wanted to wait at least another hour and half.
5 The facility is very nice and a new building. I would strongly recommend this for you as they are very fast. I have never had to wait long. Also they have late and weekend hours. As a bonus, there is an urgent care on site. Whenever I have had to make a same day appointment, I have gotten right in! I see Emily Vanderburg- PAC and she is really great and spends a good amount of time with you.
5 Let me by saying that I do not feel as though nurse practitioners or anything like a real doctor. With that being said I went into the clinic today feeling a tad bit under the weather. The wait was it typical doctor's office wait and I can't really complain about that. It seems standard that you book an appointment at 11 and you're not seen till 11:30. The nurse practitioner was super nice. She let me talk and explain what was going on. It wasn't anything serious it was just a letter of my allergies but she was able to explain what's going on what I can do and recommend some practices to help me best manage the allergy problem that I had. She even hooked me up with a little bottle of Flonase. I don't think I would make them my primary care physician this was not nearly as bad as some of the reviews I read on here
1 Why the heck is this place still open? Should be closed down for good! I visited this place 2 months ago, when I purchased a groupon for facial and massage. What a horrible experience. Not only did the lady make me wait for an additional 30 minutes, but she left the door open the entire time! NOT PROFESSIONAL at all... especially if I'm naked under a sheet of blanket!! She was also talking to me the entire time. I came here for a massage, not to have a conversation with you. Please stop talking when someone is trying to relax after a stressful day, because most likely they're not interested talking to you. Let's talk about the facial... the lady was microwaving her food while I'm lying down with mud on my face. Just because my eyes are closed doesn't mean I don't know what you're doing. I can smell the food (door) and hear you chewing like a cow. It's very unpleasant. Please be a little professional!!! Don't demand a tip when the service is like crap. It just makes my blood boil when I'm reminded of this awful experience. Everyone, stay far away... you've all been warned!
1 If you value your health go somewhere else.  I found Dr, Swenson to be as cold as a reptile, with a heart of stone, and zero intellectual curiosity.  This doctor flat out doesn't care for the welfare of another human being.  I knew when he told me that he only the insurance company gives him 7-minutes to spend with me he didn't care. When he told my wife and I that my problems were in my head and that I needed a psychiatrist, he didn't care.  After 5-months of being passed over and misdiagnosed by Dr. Swenson, I finally found someone that took the time to listen and care. It is scary when you complain about something over and over and he doesn't put the pieces together and you find out because of his "lack of intellectual curiosity" that he has missed your cancer which could have been diagnosed months ago.  If you value your health find a doctor that cares.
1 I have been waiting for 2 hours to be seen. I had an appointment for 1120 it's now 106. And still no Dr. Ready to walk out. Beyond frustrated.
2 If I hadn't moved out of state, I would have taken my daughter out of this office. The wait times are horrendous and the front office staff (mainly the woman in the picture) is so incredibly rude. I think she's on a power trip. Since this year started, it is next to IMPOSSIBLE to find parking. I don't know what happened, but it has taken me upwards of 20 minutes just to find parking within a 5 minute walk of the office. That's 25 minutes down. Ridiculous. Next, it doesn't matter if you check in early, on-time, or late, you will still be expected to wait for unnecessarily lengthy amounts of time. A quick checkup shouldn't take away +3 hours of my day.   I gave an extra star because the doctors are awesome here, but there is no reason for patients to be subjected to rude office staff that wants to punish people for being 5 mins late after being forced to walk a half-mile to the office. And I've never waited less than 20-30 mins anyway! On the day the photo was taken, our appt was at 10:20am, the photo was taken at 11:30am and as you can see, we were still in the lobby. Unacceptable. I wouldn't stand for it and I hope you don't either.
5 Nikki and MJ are amazing and make me feel so comfortable. I'm down 25 pounds in a few months.
5 I was looking up Dr. Sobel's website to send to a lady I met at Home Depot and saw these Yelp reviews.    I just had to post.    I am not sure if these negative post are just from grumpy people or what.    I will tell you our experience.  We had a Doctor that we loved.  Our insurance changed and we had to change Doctors.  We were upset and the only thing that kept me from crying was when we realized we could go to a  new Doctor and if something big came up, we would go back to our old guy and pay out of pocket.  I had a friend who I had heard talk about her Doctor many times and how wonderful he was, so I thought at least this is a place to start and got his name.    It was Dr. Larry Sobel at Sobel Family Medicine.  We went to him and have never looked back.  It has now been over 25 years.  The office is a one stop shop all setup.  It is a office of  3 brothers who are Doctors, one is a MD, that is Larry, one is a DO, that is Bruce and one that is a Sports Medicine/ Back and Spine Specialist, that is Jerry.  Also there is  Audrey Sobel who is a awesome miracle worker Physical Therapist.  They also have a Chiropractor in the office.   They do their own labs so you don't have to go elsewhere for that.  One day I said I thought I should probably get a bone density scan and they said sure, when do you want to do it?  I asked, where do I have to go for that?  The answer is just down the hall, we do it here. They even do the Ultrasound Carotid Arteries test there.  I am sure there is more that they do that I don't know about or I am forgetting to mention.  I do know they are progressive and open minded.  The bottom line is, I trust them with my life and the lives of my family.    Yes sometimes there is a wait, but I imagine it is because these are very busy and very through Doctors and I figure they are taking care of someone else.  I have never felt rushed or pushed out for the next guy.  They listen and they care.  They have a huge staff, so I imagine someone might be rude sometime, but honestly I have never encountered anyone there who has been anything but kind and caring to me.    In the years we have been going to see Larry or his PA we have had a few serious health problems and they have correctly diagnosed  them each and every time.  When they feel we need a specialist, they have consistently referred us to only the best doctors.  They don't do unnecessary  test and they don't just push drugs.  I have referred friends and family to them who in turn have referred their own friends and family to them too.    So after reading some of the negative reviews I just had to put in my two cents worth.  We have told Larry, that we are sorry, but he is not allowed to ever retire.
1 The front desk women, the Lab Corp phlebotomist, and the billing women are all totally unprofessional and rude!  I have been going to DCOM at Spring Valley for over 5 years and have been shocked and dismayed and the constant decline in patient care and patient service.  It is appalling that this center does not have a management team to reprimand these people who are rude.  Not only do they all have shockingly bad manners and are inept, Dr. Burke books out about 6-8 weeks in advance.  If you are ill, they will not get you in the same day or even that week, despite the signs posted that says "walk ins" and "same day appointments" are welcome and available.  They will tell you to go to Urgent Care.  After so many years, I am disappointed to have to look for a new PCP, but I guarantee wherever I go, the staff will be more friendly and professional than here.  Good riddance!
1 I would NOT waste my time as they wasted mine extensively.  I had to go there for 3 visits, only to be told that they do not handle the original problem that I called in for.  How does this happen?  They ask WHY you want to be seen, then when you get there, you are seen by a PA who tells you that you need to see someone else. The next person turns out to be a nurse who knows nothing. And, finally, on my last visit, I am told they do not treat.  WHAT!!??!!
1 Went in for a 3 minute drug test, filled out the forms, sat there for an hour and a half wondering why I wasn't called in yet only to find out nobody entered my info in so I was sitting there for no reason. Wasted an hour and a half of my morning.
5 I would HIGHLY recommend this facility for anyone with balance or dizziness issues.  I was diagnosed with BPPV, and Dr. James Mortensen and his team were wonderful!  They performed the Epley maneuver and recommended vestibular rehabilitation.  They have helped me immensely and designed therapy specific to my needs.  The office staff is wonderful, always a greeting and a smile, and the therapists are knowledgable, patient, understanding and compassionate.  I couldn't be more thankful for this team!
5 My significant other Wesley has been going here for a long time and the results are amazing.
4 Went in for a sick visit & office staff was friendly. The nurse and doctor were great. I felt comfortable and didn't feel rushed. Wait time to see doctor was average. I would definitely return.   If I had to be picky I would say the only thing I didn't like was the smell of the office I don't know if it was a "medicine" smell but definitely had strong odor.  This was for the Lone Mt & Decatur location. I don't remember the the doctors name but he was an elderly male of asian or hispanic background :)
5 I decided to check out Goodyear Chiropractic after hearing nothing but good things from an old friend. The clinic surpassed all of my expectations. I was very impressed with the friendliness and professionalism of the staff. Dr. Legg took the time to explain everything and really made me feel comfortable before my initial adjustment. I would recommend this place to anyone without reservation!
5 Dr. Reed and his staff are great.  He does a great job addressing specific concerns and also maintenance adjustments.  My son was having issues with his feet and Dr. Reed made an adjustment to his feet and the pain immediately dissapeared.
3 Doctors are fine but service is not good. Excessive paperwork for new patients and then another 15 minutes at the counter to repeat what is already in the paperwork. This was at the Ballantyne office.  Made a follow up appointment in Matthews (based on doctor availability) because results did not correct the discomfort. I took my 5th grader out of school, took the day off, drove 45 minutes to find out that the phone associate made the appointment for the wrong day. The ride back was an hour and 15 minutes. I am now sitting at Minute Clinic. Thanks Ortho for wasting my time. I told the lady making the appointment that my daughter likely just needs an antibiotic, and not an appointment, but much like my expressed availability, the phone associate paid little attention.  I'm hoping this is just a one off but felt compelled to share the mishap so others might be prepared.
1 So, This has been my primary doctor for almost year now. I wasn't impressed with the quality of service at first, but no real complaints initially. I needed to get an ultrasound done. I was not given any instructions, so I ate in which I was not suppose to. I ended up having to come back for another appointment. When I came back for that appointment, I was advised over the phone to the women who called me that I would just be getting my lab results, that turned out not be true. The doctor did come in an apologize for the sequence of mistakes. I continued to come for my check ups. My husband began to go as well. My husband needed to get blood work for a position he applied for, to prove he mad received his measles immunization ( we could not find his shot records) usually with blood work, they are very fast. Well, it has been over 2 weeks and still no results, we've called multiple times and nothing. My husband actually missed the job because of it. I tried calling in all day yesterday, no answer or call back, even after emailing. At this point I feel it is best to find a new Primary, for my husband and I
5 If you are in pain, this is definitely the place that you need to go. The first visit is completely free. This is my second review! This is the best place and I feel awesome!
2 I came to this facility early in the morning with neck pain and difficulty swallowing (the swallowing issue being the main reason, I thought it best to get checked out). It was slow and we were greeted by the female staff, who were very pleasant. I explained why I was there at such an early hour (difficulty swallowing) and they went on to report "a lady with a stiff neck" to the on duty doctor. Great, that's not what brought me here, but ok.   A short time later I'm greeted by an older doc who saunters up and asks what brings me here at 0400 in the morning, with an undertone of "I-bet-you're-here-for-drugs."  I said "it's not for the pain, it's because I'm having trouble swallowing and that's a bit scary. I'm not here in an ER for a neck-ache!"  Even after explaining that, he continued to be what I can only describe as annoyed I was there. This was making me pretty angry--and insulted--as a healthcare provider myself to the local community and visitors.  I came to your facility for help, not to be talked down to like street scum.   They did do a CT to check the soft tissue and found nothing, discharged me. I still have the symptoms and swallowing problems. If they continue, I'm never going back to Boulder City that's for sure.   To be fair, the female nurse was very kind. But I would try another facility like DeLima or the new Henderson location if you don't like being talked down to by the on call Dr. if you hate your patients, it's time to retire.
1 WOW! Is all I can say! First time ever trying to go to a CareNow location and the most awful experience.   Checked in online at 7:50pm and got my call. It's 8:30pm and the employee who calls is not friendly and proceeds to tell me they can't take an X-ray of ribs and I need to go to the emergency room  FOR A SORE RIB?! So I ask about not being able to take X-rays and she just says "we don't do that..".   So I'm thinking, okay weird because on the website it says you do take X-rays. So I call another CareNow location just to inquire about if I would really need to go to the ER because at this point I don't trust this location. And what do you know, the person who answers the phone is SO NICE and is the X-ray tech. He says EVERY location is able to take chest X-rays and that I DO NOT need to go to the ER.   My take on it is that the original location did not want to be bothered to have another patient come in so close to closing time. Despicable.
5 What else can I say about Mountain Park Chiro except for "PHENOMENAL".  From day 1 service has been exceptional. I feel cared for and cared about. Great Customer Service.  Keep up the good work.
5 2 years ago I developed sciatica on my right side after an aggressive yoga class combined with lots of heavy lifting. Since that cleared up I'd been dealing with back pain and associated hip and leg aches especially when I worked long hours on my feet.   I found On The Markit through Yelp and decided to give it a try, even though I'd been to two chiropractors in the past with largely unnoticeable results.   After assessing my condition Dr Erika Bell recommended a combination of stretching, ART massage, and acupuncture. I began noticing results after the very first treatment and after three sessions my condition is markedly improved. The rest of the staff have been equally professional and great to deal with. I'd recommend Dr Bell without hesitation if you're looking for an awesome chiropractor.
5 My experience at JPT was extremely positive!  All the staff, from the ladies at the front desk to Casey, the PT, to all the staff in the gym, especially Mercedes, were very friendly, professional, caring, skilled and attentive.  I haven't had any prior experience with physical therapy prior to JPT but I don't see how it could get any better.  They were all very pleasant to work with and I truly believe they cared about me and my progress.  I even came to look forward to my visits and always felt better upon leaving.  Casey was very dedicated to me throughout the process and should be commended.  Thank you JPT for a great experience.
5 I have been a patient at Warner Family Practice for 10+ years bouncing from doctor to doctor, as their turnover rate is high.   All that has changed since I started seeing Dr. Crandall. She is a compassionate doctor who listens to me and does not come across as in a rush to see her other patients. I would highly recommend Dr. Crandall as she is a great asset to Warner Family Practice!
2 I've been coming to this location since it first opened as Gold's Gym. The check-in staff have limited customer service skills often keeping their focus on their Netflix as they're checking you in. This gym is also always filthy. In the men's locker room, there's always garbage on the floor and overflowing from the garbage cans. There's rarely soap in the dispensers, too. Some of the nicer amenities are their pool, sauna, and hot tub, but considering they can't keep the locker room and gym clean, I have no faith those areas are clean. Overall, I avoid this location unless the location I go to is closed.
5 Dr. Fauer is in my lifetime - the best doctor I have had.  I've NEVER felt rushed or insignificant.  This is the doctor that you want in your corner when something is wrong because he is like a Sherlock Holmes - he doesn't leave a stone unturned and is extremely thorough.  He is very down to earth.  I walk out feeling like I saw a doctor that "practices" exceptionally.  His staff follows up in a timely manor with results as needed.
1 This doctor made me feel very bad and it had nothing to do with medicines. The  Dr. oath is to not do any harm. I was hurt and feel terrible. I wish I was treated kinder.
2 This place has always been super busy the few times i have been there. When you make an appointment, they ask you to be there 30 min prior to your appointment. You get there, fill out a sheet with some info...and wait. Then you get taken back to a room to be seen by your doctor/specialist...then wait some more.   i had an appointment today at 830. got there at 815, filled out my sheet, then waited. got walked back to the exam room...then waited at least another 30 minutes before the doctor came in. She literally talked/asked questions for 3 minutes, then rushed me out. Was not happy.   Sadly, this has been my experience everytime i have been there. The doctor was very nice and cordial, but each time i saw her, i always had to wait much longer than i should have, and was always rushed out of there.   i understand that its a busy place, but at least act like you care about your patients.
5 Great doctor! My wife had an allergy reaction to Penicillin and I had to take her to an ER. They gave her a shot of Benadryl and that was it. I asked about steroid treatment as this had happened before and the doctor said that there was no need. We went home hoping it would get better and it didn't. Next Sunday morning my wife got worse. I called Dr. Dana Forte for  an advice and she immediately offered help even she was out of state on vacation! She said what I thought the first doctor should have done in the first place. Dr Dana gave her some steroids treatment and right away within an hour the rash started going away!! Thank you for your help!
4 I highly recommend Larry Flisser as the best PT guy in Vegas. He truly cares about each and every patient's needs, and takes time to get to know you, shows real care and concern, and is very "hands on"...he has many years of experience, and is quite knowledgeable about how to help people during therapy and making good suggestions for things to do at home too.
5 Excellent! Staff is attentive and kind, making sure that we had a great experience. Absolutely love the vibe in this place, I got 50 min of relaxation while burning some cals. Definitely I recommend this place!
5 First time having physical therapy done. I was absolutely impressed with the positive energy there. Everyone was jolly and friendly, made me feel comfortable from day 1 to the last day. I would recommend this place to anyone who needs it. I am glad to have full mobility of my ankle; I appreciate the time and effort they had given me. Thank you very much!!!!!!!
1 a totaly disrespect from staff and dr. wrong lab and test results and dr. do not want to take in consideration. lies and unprofessionalims if you do not respect yourself, your healt and your money please stop by
5 I got in at 7:55am, was out of there by 8:30. Doctors and nurses were sweet and diligent! Thank you!
5 Definitely one of the best doctors in the area of obygn not only is he even my annual doctor but he also perform surgery on me and he's one of the most honest straightforward doctors that I've ever had he has a big family of his own and you can see that he takes pride in helping you build your family and really cares about your health highly advise if you're looking for a new obygn Dr
4 Woke up and my back was killing me. Quickly found a RMT and was booked with Brandon. Very professional and thorough, explanations were understandable. He's also licensed as a chiropractor but didn't try to upsell me to different services. He took a very targeted approach to address my pain and gave me exercises to practice at home. Went to see him for three sessions and noticed improvement with the pain. Now I gotta do my part and maintain the momentum at home. Establishment was clean and well kept. Receptionist call the day before to remind you of your appointment.
5 This is a great place to help with all kinds of pain. They listen and adapt your program to match. It is fun to laugh while getting better. Dr Bob is the best, he zeroed in on problems I had been dealing with for years. Things other doctors missed. His staff is wonderful and caring. I recommend this health and wellness office highly.
5 I was having problems with my leg and lower back and had physical therapy to treat my symptoms. All progress was doing great, but my problem keeps coming back and again I got relief. It took time to get rid of me problems. The staff was friendly and very helpful
5 Dr. Page is awesome!  He is a miracle worker! I've been to more doctors than I can count, and they always wanted to just give me drugs, but go no farther. Dr page has experience in every treatment available, and he always goes above and beyond to help my pain. I'm so happy I found him, and I would HIGHLY recommend his office to anyone living with severe daily pain.
5 Very friendly and welcoming staff.  Mary is great!  I had a physical here earlier this year and it was a pleasant experience, I love that everything is done in the same place.
5 I'm honestly really surprised by these reviews. I have always had great service here. The staff are always friendly and Dr.  SUAREZ is by far one of the best doctors in Vegas. She is one of the few doctors that doesn't seem rushed and will answer all of your questions. She even called me kn a Saturday as promised to give me test results. Not many doctors will do that. I love this place. And most of all this dr.
5 Dr. Robertson listens to "mother's instinct" and he works with me  to ensure great health for my 2 year old and 8 year old. I switched my pediatrician of 6 years to go to him and I am so mad at myself for not doing it 6 years earlier!!
5 Dr. Roach is the only chiropractor who has the perfect mix of finesse and force. Some doctors can crack my neck 1/2 way and some can't even get it to budge. They just make it hurt more. However, Dr. Roach is the ONLY doctor who can thoroughly "crack" my neck each and every time.   I'm a tough case b/c I was in a swimming accident (neck/back) and a major interstate auto accident (neck/shoulder) within a 6 mos time frame about 7 years ago. Unfortunately, due to ignorance, I waited about 4 years too long before getting after care. Now, my body is super tough to manipulate. I'd see Dr. Roach every day if I could but I live and work too far away. I highly recommend Dr. Roach for tough cases and newbies. See below for his office hours. Call ahead to schedule an appointment.  His office now offers trigger point injections by a licensed N.P. I've had these at other establishments and they work wonders on old, tight, stubborn tissue (ie, knots). They're great when incorporated with massage.   My personal advice is to invest in Ibuprofen, Bio-freeze, and a heating pad. I'm trying to get this location to invest in a Far-infrared Amethyst Crystal Bio Mat for use by the paying public. (Do it, Now!!!!!, Dr. Roach!)  Dr. Roach accepts insurance and has a club membership, too, for non-insured patients.
5 First time at this location but I was very pleased with the service! I loved how nice and attentive they were! Definitely going to be recommending them!
5 Great customer service.  They really take the time to get to know you.  I felt great after I left.  Best chiropractor around.
5 I have struggled with chronic migraines for at least 10 years. I would normally get at least 2-3 migraines a week lasting 2-4 days at a time. Recently, I had been having extremely bad back pains so I went to see Dr. Steve. This was my first time at a chiropractor so I didn't know what to expect. Dr. Steve not only helped my back pains on my first visit, but he also noticed immediately that there was a curve in my neck that had been causing my migraines. Within two weeks of going to Global Chiropractic, my migraines were completely gone.   I have never felt better! My back pains are gone, my headaches are extremely rare. I have and would recommend Dr. Steve to anyone. Not only is he an amazing doctor, but he is very friendly, and his office has such a welcoming environment. I have never had such luck with a doctor before!
1 DO NOT GO TO UMC !!!!!!! WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE.   NEGATIVE STARS IF I COULD !!!!!   The labor and delivery was very nice rooms and the staff was ok. I had an a doula so she did most the work.  As soon as I got over the post partum area the nightmare began. It was after hours and the nurse told me I could only have one person with me and it had to be a female. Wtf? They didn't want to allow my boyfriend, which is my daughters father to stay in the room. I had just given birth and your going to tell me I have to be without him? I told her I wanted him there to help because I was tired. She goes "there are enough nurses to help" uhm NO! That's my baby and me and HER FATHER will take care of her.  I was beyond pissed. LOOONG story short after they called security on me because I was speaking my opinion the main head chick said it was ok for him to stay. But they never gave him a chair or anything.  They forced both of us to sleep on the bed because they wouldn't even give him a chair.  The second night I took a shower and the whole bathroom and half the room flooded (there were two beds in each room). So I told the nurse and four hours later they still had not cleaned up the water. So finally I had to pee and asked the chick where should I go because it was flooded and I was afraid to fall. She said "you can go into the lobby" WTF? I'm bleeding everywhere and you want me to walk (which was hard to do with all the stitches) all the way to the lobby. Again I was livid and finally they moved us to an "upgraded room" btw all of this was between 11pm-4am. I was exhasted and they could have just done that in the first place.  NEVER AGAIN WILL I GO TO UMC.   that doesn't even mention how horribly they fed me. One piece of French toast for breakfast and can food for dinner. My boyfriend said jail food was better. Luckily my friends and family brought me food every day or I would have starved.  I didn't want to breastfeed from the beginning. So after she was born I asked for bottles. They told me they had to get it approved by a doctor because they "wrote it down wrong" about 2 hrs later I was FINALLY able to feed her.  They are way to pushy with breastfeeding and I told them way before I even got induced I was going to bottle feed.  The girl in the room next to me was having a hard time getting the baby to latch on and was getting frustrated and asked for a bottle and the doctor told her no. You could tell the baby was in distress because it was hungry so I finally went over and gave her one of mine.  How are you just going to neglect a child of food because the mom didn't want to breast feed.  -dumb ass hospital-  Definitely the worst experience of my life.  Please if you can go somewhere else DO IT. I never want anyone to experience what I had to.  Child birth is a beautiful thing and UMC makes it a nightmare.
4 My frame of reference: I've been lifting weights and doing cardio for 12 years at various gyms across Canada. I workout for health and aesthetics. I like to engage in bodybuilding, weightlifting and powerlifting exercises. Cardio and classes are not my priority as I'm already skinny and get my cardio from sports.   Totum is great for:  1. Amazing atmosphere: high ceilings, exposed light brick walls, lots of sunlight, hardwood floors. It's a great workout space. There's also a large area to stretch, punch boxing bags and skip rope.  2. Classes: I don't participate in classes, but they have a HUGE variety of them and the instructors' excitement is tangible. People who take the classes swear by them. They seem to run at all hours of the day.  3. Cardio: There are stepmasters, tons of treadmills, bikes, spinning bikes, etc. I haven't had to wait to access a treadmill since I joined. 4. Staff: The staff are friendly, especially the desk attendants. They offer chiro, nutritional advice, physio, the works. The personal trainers all seem great.  5. Towels: towels are included in your membership (small gym towels for while you workout, large ones for when you shower.) 6. Conscientiousness of members: people put their weights away and wipe up after themselves. They are also polite and friendly. Mostly young professionals. 7. Pricepoint: reasonable for the area and the quality level.   On the whole, great gym and I'd recommend it. I'd give it 5 stars if it had a standard squat rack, a preacher curl rack and opened later on the weekend. They have a squat rack, just not the usual cage kind. They also have a smith press for squatting, for those who like the guide.
5 Just received a phone call from an employee of The Little Clinic asking if I was feeling better today! The service is clearly outstanding.
5 I have been a client of Erin Smith for 2 years now for recovery athletic massage treatment. Both Erin and her partner Fanaye are very professional and offer excellence in massage and physiotherapy services. This is a new facility that they opened up over the past year. Erin has a very high level understanding of treatment for strains that I have sustained in my shoulder, back and elbow. Her treatment has been very effective in helping me to increase mobility, decrease pain and recover strength in all these areas. Many thanks to Erin for her help!
4 I started with Chandler Chiropractic when Dr. Joshua Bock was the chiropractor.  After he sold it to Dr. Mike, I continued going for quite awhile.  I always got great service and they helped me resolve many health issues, including getting my period to be less painful and more regular.  After I stopped having health insurance, I continued to go, but I had to buy packages to afford the adjustments.  But, even after that, it wasn't affordable for us anymore and we had moved a lot further away, so even less convenient.  If you live near here, they give excellent service and care.  Both my kids also got regular adjustments for as long as we could afford it.
5 I have been coming to the Adelaide Clinic for 15+ years. In that time, I have seen a number of health practitioners (chiropractic, physiotherapy, massage therapy and Chinese medicine) there and have always felt like my concerns and treatment was taken seriously and addressed to the best of their ability.  I am also seen on time which is a rare thing in a doctor's office! The staff, doctors and practitioners here care about their patients.   Reagan - for a massage that is out of this world, especially if you like deep tissue vs "light and fluffy".   Jumy - for TCM, helped me address some issues through acupuncture and other treatments, which I use as an integral part of my health care.   Last but not least, Dr. Lee has been my chiropractor for over 15 years, and he is the reason I first came to the clinic. In that time I have sent my husband, my mother with spinal issues, my grandmother and several other family members to see him.   Dr. Lee focuses on the root cause of the problem, never just an "adjustment and done". Over the years, he has helped me recover from a knee injury, repetitive strain in arms and shoulders, back pain. He has also helped me be more aware of my body alignment and areas to strengthen, which keeps me out of his office, rather than in!   To support his patients, Dr. Lee is always striving to further his knowledge and  techniques, to work in partnership with other health care providers even when they are outside of his clinic, and genuinely cares for his patients and their well being and experience.   I gladly continue to come to the Adelaide Clinic as partner in my health care.
1 HORRIBLE!!!!   This doctor and staff has the worst customer service my family has ever experienced. First let me say that since this doctor has a large portion of his practice that is pediatrics, however, they do not have the common sense to make the waiting room somewhat kid friendly. Although that is clearly not the reason anyone would choose a doctor the reason for pointing this out is because I honestly do not believe we were ever attended to on time for our appointments. Even though this office never was on time, they have a strict rule of patients being on time or they will require you to reschedule your appointment. We actually showed up 5 minutes after our appointment once and we were turned away. Just know this, we NEVER got out of that office in under 90 minutes. Clearly the doctor believes his time is the only one that has any value. So, if the standard practice is never being on time then at least having something to distract young children as they wait impatiently in this standard waiting room. This is simply a good business practice by providing what the customers need.  The front desk staff is completely unprofessional as well. We constantly had to wait as they finished their personal conversation among themselves. This unresponsiveness also continues throughout the course of the visit when we have been sitting waiting for well over an hour just about every visit we went on. Whenever we asked how much longer it would take for the doctor to come see us because our infant child was tired, grumpy, and agitated they would look at us with a blank stare as if nothing was registering in their head and simply told us the doctor would be in soon.  As for the doctor, well generally, he was pleasant when we would finally see him. However, from the moment he walked in it was clear that he had already moved on to his next appointment. Every time we asked questions he would respond appropriately but he would hurriedly say "Ok any other questions?!!" while making the motions of clapping his hands as if he was trying to push us out the door. Now I realize he has a busy practice and that's great for him, but as first time parents we always had many questions. We never really felt like Dr George wanted to spend any more time with us and our child than he absolutely had to, which was completely unprofessional. Finally, something that we found a bit disturbing was that he always posed the same question to us prior to leaving an appointment "So when are you having another baby". At first we believed that was very thoughtful, but as we got to know him better we came to believe that he was simply seeing dollar signs and only trying to fuel his practice with new children. Of course I realize that is natural in any business, however, I don't think he needs to be so pushy about it. Those types of decisions are very personal between my wife and I, we should not have to be pressured by our doctor every single time we go in for a visit.   It is for these reasons that I would never recommend this doctor to anyone and I simply want to share my experience with others so that people have this information prior to choosing one of the most important people in your child's life. We have since found a doctor that is always prompt to his appointments. Between the time we get to the doctor at Sunshine Pediatrics (our new doctor) till when we leave its generally half the time we would spend at Dr George's office, on average.
4 They are very nice. Always willing to work with my work schedule. PT hurts like a son of a gun... But it's well worth it. I go for pinched nerves in my back and my neck. The massage part is what hurts the most.. but they are very gentle and considerate. Thank you guys!!!
5 I love this pediatricians office! My hubby and i are self employed and dont have insurance, these folks let us pay out of pocket and its only $55 per visit.   Dr vu is caring, knowledgable and great with kids. I also love the nurse practitioner.   They get me in & outquickly, are always polite, and the last two times I had to get my kids in quickly, they scheduled me for THAT DAY.  Also there are separate waiting rooms for sick/well patients, and toys and books for the kids in the waiting room. Five stars!
5 I wish I could give Dr. Johnson more than five stars!  I don't even know where to begin with how happy I am with his care for my family.  He is the most caring, professional, compassionate doctor I have ever experienced.  Always there for me and my family and so easy to work with...no insurance headache!  He's the best.
1 Never go to this place. Not professional, not kind, poor knowledge. Even my husband didnt have any problems, they sent him to the emergency room because their data reading was wrong and they said "it looks strange"! We tried to contact them for the bill, but nobody answered.
5 I went to Dr. Mohajer to get help managing postsurgical pain from a cervical fusion. He helped me manage my severe immediate postsurgery pain and then my pain levels moving forward. Dr. Mohajer was knowledgeable about all options for pain management and explained them to me clearly. He also listened to what I was comfortable with treatment-wise to determine the most optimal treatment plan.
1 I had been a customer for about 10 years, but hadn't been in for 2-3 years (change in insurance meant allergy-related visits were much more expensive, and then I just got busy...).  When calling to make a wellness check appointment, they said it had been too long and they'd have to add me as a new customer, and they wouldn't do a wellness check unless I scheduled another procedure as well.    The point of a wellness check is that it isn't in conjunction with diagnosing or treating any other conditions.  Why would I schedule a needless procedure just because they're greedy?  Now I need to find a new doctor.  It's just as well, I had never been extremely satisfied with this office.  While I was going more frequently, I would see a variety of their doctors and PAs, with varying results (some were good).  It was decent enough to not look elsewhere, but I frequently felt that I was mostly given the brush-off and shuffled out as quickly as possible.
5 I come here about once a month to help my crooked back. As far as convenience goes, you can't beat The Joint. I come in during my lunch hour and I'm in and out within 15 minutes.   Dr. Judge is great. Twice I've had to come in because I injured myself to the point of limited mobility. Both times I was back to normal within a few days. The most recent was a shoulder injury. I was actually out of town when this happened and went to a full service chiropractor seeking relief. The other chiropractor hooked me up to a bunch of fancy  machines and... no results. Time and money wasted.  Came back to Dr. Judge yesterday and immediate relief.   If you have any issues with your back, I highly recommend coming in for an adjustment before you seek additional, expensive treatment.
5 I want to start by saying that I hate going to doctors and the entire traditional medical process. Most of you will identify with this horrible process after reading it. It starts with you getting sick or pain that drives you to want to see a doctor in the first place. Not a good experience already! You call to make an appointment in which you first encounter a rude receptionist. Then you finally make it in to your scheduled appointment and actually get to meet your rude receptionist face to face. Without even a greeting she barks orders that go something like..."fill out this, give me that and take a seat until the doctor can get to you." Get to me? Umm hello? I think I made an appointment for this specific time. I'm busy too! This system only works because your sick and desperate for help. It could never work in retail or any other form because you know people would return that shit in a heart beat!! After waiting for hours to be seen by your money hungry physician that clearly overbooked himself, he rapidly and condescendingly delivers some hypothetical diagnosis, and prescribes some drugs that are sure to just cover up your real issue. You have just left the doctor upset, confused and vow never to go back unless you're dying. At least that's what I have said...until I met Dr. Alex.  I visited Dr. Alex for an all natural proactive treatment to help improve my thinning hairline. Upon arrival for my 10am appointment I was immediately greeted and taken back to meet with her. She made me comfortable and talked to me like a human being. Best of all she made the time to answer every single one of my questions/concerns before starting the treatment. I felt like a was talking to my really smart friend and getting great advice rather than taking orders from a pompous physician. Never did I feel rushed or intimidated. I will continue treatment with her and visiting for any other medical issues that come up in the future.
1 Although the doctor may be okay, the customer service is terrible. I was 10 min late to my appointment and the front desk girl checked me in with no problem. I sat there for almost 2 hours waiting to be called and the front desk girl never said anything to me. When I asked her what was taking so long, she said because I was late they were skipping over me. How inconvenient and a waste of time. All she had to do was tell me so in the first place and I would have rescheduled. I definitely will not return and will not recommend this place, as they have no respect for their patients.
5 I was fortunate to be referred to Phyllis Euley for physical therapy due to unrelenting back and neck pain. I have been in physical therapy for many years, and spend many hours there. I am probably one of the most compliant patients.. She gives me excersizes and I follow through with in home instruction . I thought I had experienced all I could learn in excersize treatment. There is always more to learn!Phyllis is quite experienced, spends time explaining everything.. She does 95 percent of the work with me directly. I appreciate that. She is an extremely pleasant person,which helps make the time pass. I am not kept waiting in a waiting room or on a table but constantly active during the time I am there with Phyllis. The staff is very pleasant.. My only future request would be privacy at each patients table.
5 Incredible massage. I have suffered from back and neck pain since an early injury, and have had many massages by many different therapists- Ed is by far the best therapist Ive been to- he knows exactly where to focus, and he relieved me of acute pain in one session
3 i have been practicing "regular" yoga for a few years, off and on, and tried out bikram for a couple months over the summer. i even went seven times in the first ten days, and it did help me feel better, overall.  so the facilities at this studio are really great. the room is huge and has a soft floor that soaks up all the sweat so there aren't giant puddles everywhere. the air flow and circulation are really great; even though its super hot and humid, the air doesn't feel stale or stagnant.  although i honestly feel that going to this bikram practice helped my shoulder begin the recovery process from a pretty serious injury, i do not think bikram is the practice for me, even at this place.  i go to yoga for the "zen" aspects and to help build overall strength and flexibility. bikram basically is just holding stretches, not necessarily challenging your strength. and just because you are sweating does not mean you are getting the workout of a lifetime, it just means the room is 105 degrees!  one negative aspect of this place is the instructors; they act like this is a boot camp workout.  "straighten your leg."  "STRAIGHTEN YOUR LEG."  "STRAIGHTEN YOUR (EFFING) LEG!!!!!!"   each repetition of phrases like this would get louder and actually more MEAN sounding. and btw, that was said to the whole class, not just to me individually.  i know i might come off as snobby here, but i do not really like many of the people/clients who practice here. many people are soooo inconsiderate of others' practices! i guess that goes to how this is more a trendy fitness bootcamp then a zen yoga practice. some people leave and come back (multiple times?) during class (they say not to). when the practice is over, i like to take a few extra moments in shavasana to collect myself but a bunch of people jump up to leave immediately (nothing wrong with that) but they make so much noise rolling up their mats and just leaving the room, not respecting others practices. also, i got sweat dripped (more like poured!) on me when someone walked right over me with their sweaty mat.  and they talk about this bikram guy like he is the second jesus but it just seems like the whole thing is all about money.
5 Saw Dr. Shelly Rodriguez. I needed to see a doctor the same day and she had an appointment available. I was the last appointment of the day and there was no one in the waiting room. Seats in the waiting room and in the private rooms were very comfy. The whole place was clean. Everything went smoothly and this woman listened to everything wrong with me and was very patient and understanding. She seemed like the sweetest woman, also very young and I couldn't believe she was a doctor because she was also cute. Staff was friendly and I had to pay cash for the visit: $77. Pretty reasonable to me. No complaints here.
1 Licensed staff seemed fine and listened. Rest of the staff is worthless although to be fair they seem to be understaffed and overworked. Hung up three times after being on hold between 20-30 minutes each. Now on the 4th time call and they at least picked up the phone and acknowledged my wait 20 minutes into call but I am going on almost 40 minutes on hold... and still holding. I wish I had a 4 hour drive to be sitting here on hold for. Got x-rays to bring to specialist that I finally got referral to only to have a blank disc, went back and they still couldnt figure out how to get it printed. Only reason I even go to this place is for specialist referrals and last time I went a year ago, I gave up. Went again this year for another problem and tried again to get referrals to follow up on issues I still had pending from last year and gave up. Definitely going to be looking for a new primary care practice after getting through these immediate issues.
3 first time patient, very attentive customer service, good doctor, and more reasonable than others price wise, however after you are done on the day it seems like they are not as quick nd efficient to call you back for next step ( for example test result) i knew for the fact my test has been sent from the lab but i had to go in person as they delayed getting back to me! hummmm like many other fast in getting your money! what about compassion!
5 Dr. Steven is awesome! Took great care of me. I would highly recommend them for anyone looking for a great chiropractic Dr.
5 I've been going here over a year now. The environment is really comfortable, extremely kind staff, excellent doctors and amazing Physical therapists. I want to name people but everyone here is great and I don't want to leave anyone out. My lower back pain is significantly better then when I first started coming here. I highly recommend Pain Stop Clinic
1 Do not come to urgent care extra. They just send you elsewhere. They don't have a dr available. We were seen last night the pay was nice but she did not know how to diagnose a broken bone that was clearly broken on the X-ray. She told us my son had a bruise and gave him a sling. When I looked at X-ray you could see it is broken. She gave me a number for follow up and they were unable to see him. I got in with another dr this morning and they will not accept the X-ray taken last night. So you will pay twice as your insurance will not cover the same thing twice. Pretty much the same thing happened last time I went to urgent care with my daughter but the next dr used the X-ray they took. These places are a scam to take your money and not do anything for you. Stay away. I will be going back to ask for a refund and for them to not submit to my insurance as their services need to be repeated. Ironically I asked if they could treat his bone if it was broken and they said yes. They lied. They did not know if I could just pay cash they are only concerned with how they can milk your insurance for payments and the. They balance bill you as they take your credit card.
5 Best urgent care I'v been to. Office is new, spacious, and clean. Also, it's not busy here and they aren't under staffed. The doctors here are great and answered questions that doctors at other urgent cares couldn't. I wasn't rushed and got all the insight i needed on what to do to fix my problem. If you check in you get a free in-house prescription. So my Vicodin was free, awesome.
5 I just had a massage with Sawana and I can confidently say that it was by far the best massage I have ever had. Not only is she extremely talented, she is very knowledgeable. She took the time to talk with me to get a good understanding of my needs. Her studio is a warm an inviting space.  I was immediately at ease as soon as I walked in. The entire experience far exceeded my expectations. I will definitely be a regular client!
2 I 100% agree with Lisa's comment. The doctor is super nice but that's about it. Pointless to schedule appointment time when you always have to wait over 45 minutes- always. Had some issues with getting a referral also. And my ringworm was diagnosed as dry skin. Will be looking for a new doctor.
4 My appointment was at 2pm today with Dr Mahadevan who was a great listener an did a great job of explaining how he would attempt to handle my issues and address my concerns. The receptionist and medical assistant were both very nice and appeared compassionate and attentive. I left the office feeling like I was on an decent path and had some slight confidence his course of treatment would be helpful at the least.  The only issue I had was the provider said he was going to prescribe me a few medications to help me manage my symptoms, but after 4 hours my pharmacy stated they never received the prescriptions and that it doesn't take longer than 2 hours so I should contact my doctor. I called the office, which is now closed (6pm) and the option to speak with the on call physician goes directly to voicemail with no ringing. However I did receive a call from the Doctor within an hour  of leaving the message to which he apologized and re-sent the prescriptions to the pharmacy.  This provider asked my willingness to change to him to continue treatment during my visit and at the time I was slightly agreeable. Based on this experience its still a possibility. Aside from the little hiccup with the pharmacy I would recommend the doctor and staff. Thanks!
5 From the gentleman at the front desk to the doctor, everyone was kind and professional. In an out with thorough directions.
5 I've only been to 1 session thus far but my experience here today vs. my previous PT session was like night and day.  I just had knee surgery Monday--ACL reconstruction and meniscectomy--and my orthopedic surgeon Crovetti wanted me to start PT within 2 days.  Since I had such short notice to find a PT, I had initially gone to Paragon of Summerlin for my first visit where they accomplished absolutely nothing, did not seem like they were sure about my injury, treatment plan, or progress expectations. It was such a bad experience and I instantly knew I did not want to go back.  Luckily, I did some more research right after that awful experience at the other PT this past Wednesday, came across Modern Athletic Science / Donatelli Physical Therapy and was able to get an appointment for today (Friday). So glad I decided to give them a shot as they specialize in helping athletes and definitely look and sound like they know exactly what they are doing. Being a NASM CPT myself and athlete most of my life, I have high expectations and standards when it comes to exercise and training so rest assured you will be in good hands here.  First, as soon as I walked through the door, Bob pointed out that my crutches were incorrect and helped adjust/fix them. Then, in the treatment room, he used a special machine with some red lights and heat that helped reduced the swelling in my knee significantly within just minutes.   Throughout this process, he explained in detail what the machine did and how it does it though I don't recall all the details I do appreciate how knowledgeable he was about everything. Also, both Bob and Georgi clearly explained the expected progress / timelines for when I should get full flexion of my knee (approximately 1 week), when I could expect to build back my quad muscles based on his firsthand experience rehabbing another body builder with a knee injury (6 + 15 weeks), and even when I can go back to my normal strength training (5-6 months).  After the swelling went down, we did some simple exercises and he wrapped my bandage back up. Overall, it was a good experience and they make you feel like family here. It is so rare nowadays to find businesses and people, especially in the medical field, that actually care about their clients/patients and take pride in their work. It is clear that is the case here and I'm glad I found this place! Lucky they take my insurance and looking forward to working with everyone to get my knee back to to 100%
5 Very satisfied with treatment here at Az Spine Disc and Sport. Keeps me healthy and strong in my career and hobbies such as trail running and rock climbing. Special thanks  to Dr. Christopher, Dr. Rudd and Auden Leyva!
1 I have had several bad experiences with this clinic.  I had explained to one of the Dr's that I was super emotional and it was really out of the ordinary for me...she kept saying I was depressed or suicidal, I wasn't...it's a hormone imbalance for which another doctor is helping me with and I'm feeling much better...next I was late by 8 minutes to an appointment, the front desk informed me that I had to reschedule as they wanted to close the office as I had missed my appointment.  Bedside manor is seriously lacking.
5 I had severe vertigo, was bedridden (for 8 days total!!) to a dark room and had to wear an eye mask to help stop nystagmus, regular vomiting, couldn't walk without falling over, waking up in the night feeling like I was a sailboat in a storm, the worst medical experience of my life.  My doctor "prescribed" gravol, and said "there is no cure, no indication of how long it will last and no known cause". Que panic stations - no cure was my worst nightmare. While she was sympathetic and rubbed my back as I dry retched, they were not the words I wanted to hear!! After getting home from the Dr, my husband looked through Yelp to find a chiropractor (my stepdad is one in Australia so I am comfortable with chiro and have had it most of my life) and Evolve came highly rated. We jumped in a car2go and drove there straight away - me in track pants, a hoodie, sunglasses, slippers and a bag to puke in :( - on day four of my hell. The girls on the front desk were so lovely, they held open the door so my husband could carry me in, got me some peppermint water (turns out peppermint is a natural remedy for dizziness), dimmed the lights, everyone spoke quietly - even the other patients. I must have looked like death, plus I'd not showered properly or brushed my hair in days as I'd vomit if I did either. TMI? Maybe, but you need to know all the priors because after seeing Dr Sommers ONCE (who was incredibly empathetic even though he said this was the worst case he'd ever seen), the vomiting and "sailboat" feeling stopped. By the second visit, the next day, the nystagmus had stopped, thank god. By the 3rd visit I could walk unassisted and open my eyes properly. I felt like singing gospel from the mountain tops.  Both my husband and I now see Dr Sommers every month for 'maintenance' and preventative chiropractic care, he's very gentle and practices active release technique, which feels like a combination of chiro and osteo, so don't be deterred if you think chiropractors are 'bone crunchers'.  It also doesn't hurt that he's just a super nice guy.  Highly highly recommended.
1 I can only speak of the customer service. As I have waited over 2 months to have my son seen. It took forever to get an appointment and then when I did it took over a month for them to go over the evaluation we had, then submit it to my insurance. Every time I called they kept saying "oh wait 2 more weeks if you don't hear from us call us back" seriously you can't keep track of your patients and make courtesy calls to people that are paying you for your services. Honestly if you need to hire more employees to keep up with your massive amounts of patients then do that, or stop excepting patients you can manage in a timely matter! It's frustrating when you put the care of child into the hands of people who can not communicate properly. Yes I could have went to another place but it just wasn't worth starting all over again with my insurance. I can only hope the therapy we need for our son will be much better than their customer service. The office staff is less than stellar, so if you are customer service orientated this is not the place for your child.
1 If you are legally medicinal cannabis patient whom uses it for SEVERE PTSD as proven with documentation....they won't treat you for your illnesses because they are illiterate or something even though it's 2017 and google is free. Dr. Adrian is an old school crook stuck in the Regan era and needs to retire of go back to school. Complete and utter TRASH.
5 I've been to almost all of the reflexology spa's in Richmond Hill and this one is by far the best one. I was kind of skeptical at first because it was new and there were no reviews to go by but I'm so glad I went. My bf and I had a couples back massage followed by a foot massage and for someone who doesn't even enjoy massages, he LOVED it. As soon as we finished he bought us a package so we will definitely be returning soon!
5 Everyone was amazing! I went in broken and left feeling great!  Everyone was very friendly and helpful.  The traction and adjustments were scary at first but after a couple times it felt great and I looked forward to it, plus after I was done I got to sit in their comfy massage chairs with some ice. I feel the difference from when I first started to come see them.  I also liked how they were able to work with my work schedule.
1 DO NOT COME HERE.   I found this place from ZocDoc, which actually seemed like a decent location to go. I showed up half an hour early, to fill out paperwork and make sure everything was squared away. The receptionist did not greet me, and was chatting on her personal cell, and made it seem like I was bothering her when I asked to check in. After filling out paperwork, I waited for 45 minutes before being shown to a room.   The office seems very old and creepy. Each room had a floor fan and a beat up desk. One of the hallways didn't even have its lights on! Just completely dark, very creepy.   I waited in the room for an HOUR before finally getting up and searching for someone. I couldn't find any nurse or doctor (which is very strange), and even went into their break room! The place just looked completely deserted.   Finally I found someone who informed me that the doctor would "be right with me". I had other errands to run, so I packed my things and was walking out the door when the doctor came running up to me. She informed me that she had another patient to see before me, and to wait 15 minutes. (At this point I was very upset and frustrated). I told her that I would not wait, since I had been waiting already an hour in the patient room. She asked me to wait a moment, that she would tell the other patient to wait and then she could help me.  She was knowledgable, and her beside manner was good, but it's not worth the wait. She examined me, wrote me a prescription (had to wait another 20 minutes for this), and I was finally free to go. Oh, and that receptionist was still on her phone when I was waiting in the lobby.   Moral of the story; don't trust ZocDoc with their recommendations. I should've checked Yelp to see what people had to say. This could've all been avoided if I had seen all these reviews first! And don't go to this practice!!! THE MOST unprofessional and unpleasant experience I've had the displeasure of living through.
1 The worst doctor's office I've ever dealt with.  I give this place 1 star because the PA, Alice Peterson, is excellent.  I went to Dr. McCoy for a chronically painful hip (osteoarthritis). He sent me to Physical Therapy, even though I'd already been once before. PT was excruciating, so I returned to McCoy. He gave me serious narcotics (too strong) and got me an MRI. A week after the MRI, I'd heard nothing back. Called the office and found out the doctor hadn't even read it yet. When he did, he saw a labral tear in the cartilege and sent me to an arthroscopic speciatist. That guy told me that there was no point fixing the tear, I needed a hip replacement. So had to wait for an appointment with good hip surgeon and then wait for surgery date.  I needed a pre-surgical physical and blood tests, which also were ordered through these people. Again, Alice was great. I had everything done 2 weeks before they were due. Again, no response, no feedback on tests. On the Thursday before they were due, I called and was told that they would be marked "urgent". Today, the Monday the results were due, I called my surgeon -- no results had been faxed. Turns out they'd been faxing USM the previous Thursday and today too. I called USM and they told me they would mark my request 'urgent'. Ha! Ha! I told them they'd already done that and that I could come down and hand carry the results to my surgeon. I was very irate. They put me on hold, apologized, told me the results had been faxed that day and would be faxed again. We'll see.  The front desk has been consistently rude and incompetent. Once I said I needed an appointment in 4-6 weeks. The front desk person said, "46 weeks"? I moved to AZ recently and had this office recommended to me. I will NEVER return.
4 hi.. jst went to Zen..we had a couple massage.Swedish massage was very good and relaxing.You can ask for wht you are looking for and thy deliver you hwo u lik it. Ambience and total experience was good
4 Pleasantly surprised by this place!  To be honest, my first encounter there was a bit off-putting as they messed up the scheduling and wanted us to wait 40 minutes, but after rescheduling and completing my first appointment my grudge is gone :)  I had the one hour thai massage. Upon first glace looks like a medical building, and not like it will feel "spa-like" at all but looks can be deceiving. The staff are very friendly, the place clean, and the massage room was great. Dim lighting, candle lit, fountain running with relaxing spa music playing.  My tiny masseuse was stronger than any man, and seemed to really know her stuff. Talking was kept to a minimum (which I like) and the massage was one of the best I've had in ages - surpassing my most recent visits to Elmwood & Scandinave.  Prices are reasonable, and parking is free.
5 Sawana is an amazing healer. She has a uniquely intuitive way of picking up on exactly what is needed for mind, body and spirit. Sawana is one of a kind.
5 I received the referral from my orthopedist and insurance. It took a couple days to get the insurance approved and my first appointment set.   The first appointment was great. The physical therapist completed a full assessment, asked my goals, and we set a plan of action together.   This office has lots of therapists, techs, and equipment available for all your needs. They work together as a team so your waiting time between exercises or treatments is very minimal.   I also appreciate the staff's positive and encouraging attitudes. That's what I need to achieve my goals.
4 When you're sick and need help NOW, and the general practitioners that you call can't see you for TWO WEEKS, where do you go?  To the urgent care clinic.  East Valley Urgent Care is the closest one to me.  Now, when you go to a facility that offers walk-in service, you may find a waiting room that's nearly empty, or an absolute full house.  I've seen both.  Frankly, I didn't care--I'd rather be able to wait a few hours to get care today than at an appointment in two weeks.  The kids crying can get a little irritating, but the facility is neat and clean.  Service is good once you get a room.  They accept insurance and at all of the times that I have been there, members of my family have received excellent care.  I almost wonder if I really need a general practitioner at all at this point.  If this is the one place that can guarantee me care when I need it without having to go to the ER, maybe I'll just stick with these guys.
3 $$$$$ will work with u for cash, Getting a jelly type substance (hypodermic acid) make sure U ask for Euflexxa or supartz; they R more natural so safer 4 ur body) shot in my knee  so I don't have to have knee surgery.   At first they wanted me to get a knee replacement. Don't do it research google prp & orthopedics. The body is an amazing thing, One Dr. here does this prosedure however I can't remember his name.
1 Very bad experience.  The two therapists my wife experienced had no compassion or other people skills.  Perhaps the large captive market for physical therapy services in the nearby senior living communities insulates the staff from the need to treat patients with respect.  Or perhaps they just don't care.  We found another local provider and will not return.
5 Wow a doctor who actually listens AND allows you to have an opinion about your health care! She takes the time to explain things too. Great personality. I will definitely recommend her to anyone.
1 This place is straight out just a joke.The so called "doctors" or training doctors wtf ever they are will confuse you question you and contradict themselves. Ive been seen specifically at their labor and delivery and i am disgusted with the way i have been treated. I went in with blurry vision and headaches and nausea i felt just crappy the nurse had the nerve to say to me..."are you really having any symptoms or are you just coming here because?" i swear i could have told her off and walked right out but i didn't i kept calm, On top of that they checked my urine and one of them behind the curtain was like her sugars high and the other said loud enough for me to hear "I'm not surprised" i have gest diabetes, so that was really rude of her. They didn't even check my blood sugar which had been fine all day. They have badgered me for not have been seen by a doctor since I'm so far along in my pregnancy and no doctor will see me unless i pay out the butt. They kept saying well you need to go, your baby could die if your not monitored while having diabetes's etc. I monitor my sugars take my meds and eat the way i should, so WHY would my baby DIE just because some doctor didn't get paid to do the same thing? I absolutely will never go there again. Every time Ive left there in tears for feeling like crap because specifically the way they talked to me. Honestly Ive been 100x more stressed out since i started going there and i will no longer.
5 I went for my first appointment yesterday.  I had a referral from my doctor and brought my MRI. Everything was WONDERFUL!  The front desk was really nice (probably because I am not a crazy or whiny human) and got me set up right away.  The nurse was awesome, the Nurse Practitioner was GREAT and very thorough also she explained everything perfectly to me. She even had my Rx sent to my pharmacy and it was ready for me to pick up on the way home.  (non-narcotic, which I prefer and a medicine that is perfect for my condition and I had never even heard of before.)  Then Doctor Pico came in and also was WONDERFUL he saw my MRI and said he wanted to get me in for a shot asap. (which I did today, and again everyone couldn't have been nicer or better in any way).  I also saw the chiropractor and scheduled an appt for this Friday, I have high hopes for that as well as again he was very nice, down to earth and explained to me what to expect.    I hardly ever review, but before I went I read all of these reviews and got a little scared to go.  Now I am reading them in a totally different light.     The office is great, the staff is excellent, the care is exceptional.
5 I have seen Melanie overt the past 3 months, during that time I can attest that my mobility has improved immensely. I am  recovering from a badly damaged shoulder and rotator cuff injury. With Melanie's therapy and exercise action plan, I am very pleased with my progress. I heartily recommend Melanie at MYOCARE whether you have specific treatment requirements or just want a relaxing tension releasing massage.
4 Dr. Darzev is very nice and knowledgeable.  The physician's assistant came and spoke to me first and then she came in for further clarification.  Very personable, upbeat, laughing and gave a great explanation of what she thought was going on and why she was going to have me on the meds she prescribed.  The other nurses and front office staff were also very courteous and friendly.  Very good experience and I'm glad I randomly chose her out of my insurance's "find a doctor" website haha
1 I wish I could give 0 stars. I have never  spoken to such a rude & inconsiderate "general manager" in my life. I called to make an appointment and she repeatedly cut me off asking for my name & information  as I was simply asking for the price of the massage. Then she began asking for the credit card number with out answering my question of the price or availability.  When I finally demanded that she paused, then give me the price... I had enough. I told her thati was going somewhere else...  Her short reply: "fine"  Then she hung up.  This is a terrible indicator of what their massage service would be. Who wants to be stressed out about a rude front desk person when you are trying to relax with a massage?!
5 Wow what a great amazing place to be when u r in pain. This staff knows how to treat their patients.. they make u feel amazing even when u dont want too. Keep up the great work .. they are always smiling and asking u how ur day is. This place is top of the line. Best chiropractors ever..!!!
5 Love bold body works. Great massage very professional strong but not to strong and feel great after...thank you so much Brent.
5 My Goodness was this Medical Center a breath of fresh air when your feeling HORRIBLE from all ends! With no insurance I had called everywhere only to be shot down until I called this number. None of my questions were bothersome and they quickly made me an appointment. Likewise I don't go to see the doctor often unless I have really bad symptoms or any type of chain reaction from being more care-free and most of the time self healing. Doctor Bikas Sharma is so professional and predicted what may have caused me and my partners sickness even. Great smiling staff. I would refer refer refer anyone to this doctor. He has given me hope in the medical field. He was so attentive, informative, professional in my experience AND FOR SUCH A LOW FEE. Highly recommend for those without insurance. Bottom line this Doctor was inspiring. Thank you to Trails Family Medical
5 This place is great! Smart, effective Physical Therapy. They are seasoned, sports minded therapist. They're focused on service and getting you back to the level of activity that's important to you!  Sad to say, I've seen a lot of PT over the years. The atmosphere here is the best! It has a very down to earth, professional vibe. It's all about recovery.   My doctor recommended I go to rehab associated with his practice. But it seemed too sterile. A friend recommended Rehab Plus for his successful recovery from knee and IT Band problems.   My hip and knee arthritis was keeping me off the court and day to day activities were painful. My therapy regimen included basic strengthening and sport specific exercises that improved my game.  Someone's with you at all times to ensure you're doing the right thing, working with proper form. They're attentive, enthusiastic and patient.  I highly recommend Rehab Plus!
5 I had a very positive experience through the my 2.5 month rehab for shoulder/ rotor cup issues. Ed and his crew were very attentative to my progress and healing regimens. Great crew. Great facility.  Healed shoulder!
1 A friend recommended this doctor, 15 mins on hold before I hung up. Couldn't even make an appointment.
5 Wow. I cannot begin to tell you how much Urgent Care Extra has come through for me.  After moving to AZ, I got hit with a MAJOR case of allergies. No exaggeration, I had never ever been that sick in my life with any kind of illness as I was with these allergies. I seriously thought this was the end.  I was greeted immediately upon walking in and after a few sheets of paperwork, I was on my way back to see the provider. They got me all fixed up and within a couple of days of using the medication prescribed, I was on the road to recovery.  $50 gets you in to see a doctor and $15 will cover each prescription if necessary. This is a GREAT deal especially if you don;t have insurance coverage. (fyi, use the yelp check in offer for a free prescription to save a few extra bucks).  I would highly recommend this location if you are in need of immediate medical assistance.
1 I have to agree with the majority of the reviews here. This place does not even warrant a star. I will say the staff was very apologetic, but Dr. D Wachs bedside manner is HORRIBLE!!! I do not care what type of radio show she has the patients are customers that keeps her in business. As a referral from another doctors office I will let them know that Dr. Wachs is not worth the referral.
5 Awesome facility.  I moved here last year and was excited to try cryotherapy.  Angelo makes you feel comfortable and at ease.  They offer a ton of other treatments for muscle pain and inflammation.  I have been doing 'shock wave' treatments to break up scar tissue with Dr. Taylor (she is amazing). It is life changing!!  If I could give 10 stars I would!!
5 10 stars for this ER, trauma, and burn center! I'm sooooo happy we rushed to UMC when ER Spring Valley hospital neglected my boyfriend for an hour while his skin was burning. He was burned very badly from our bbq pit on his face, neck, hands and arms. Unknowing that UMC had the only burn center we rushed to the nearest hospital which was Spring Valley. Such a mistake! After I noticed how neglectful they were as they watched my boyfriend run around the ER in agonizing pain and did nothing to help, we ran out of there! (I have a full story about that ER btw) Anyway we ran into UMC ER and as we were frantically looking for the check in desk the security guard pointed us to it. There was a boy in front of us who took a couple of seconds. When it was our turn the gentleman at the check in desk asked for ID and I handed it to him. He asked my boyfriend what happened and he replied he was burned and placed his hands on the counter. The burns were pretty obvious. His hands and arms were charred and blistering at this point, his facial hair was singed, his eyelashes were gone, and his nose was raw, plus him groaning and jumping around proved he was in serious pain. The gentlemen immediately handed me back his ID, not interested in inputting his name in any computer system, and instructed someone to get him a wheelchair and rush him to trauma. He saw a doctor and was given pain meds and a tetanus shot within minutes. They cleaned him up spread ointment on all the burns and gave him an order to go to the burn center the next day. He was discharged within 2 hours! Luckily they were 2nd degree burns. Still very painful but could have been worse! The burn center is just as good and deserves 10 stars as well! Virtually no wait time to see the nurse. The nurse rubbed all of the charred and dead skin off and bursted all of his blisters (pretty painful to watch but cool too) She wrapped him up very well and gave us instructions on how to take care of his skin to avoid infection. She told us where to get his supplies and got his prescription promptly. She was so kind! I am so appreciative of this place and my boyfriend definitely is!
5 Brenda is just simply fabulous. She takes her time to get to know her clients and the best way to accommodate them. She always leaves me so relaxed and rejuvenated. I would definitely recommend her to others. She's very personable, affordable, and sure knows how to give great  massages. :)
1 Absolutely horrible experience!! Do not see this fraudulant medical clinic. They should not be practicing medicine. AVOID at all costs.
4 Very Hit and Miss.   I have been here a few times and the front staff can be very friendly or a tad rude.  I have waited about 45 minutes in the past.   I think they are improving because my experience last week was great!  I only waited about 10 minutes with a room FULL of patients. I had a great nurse and she was very professional and nice. I have officially found a great doctor. Dr. Hailstone did not rush me out of the room. He is worth a potential wait and rude front staff. I would absolutely recommend him to anyone.
5 I had my first massage three months ago and had a very relaxing experience. Anna, my massage therapist, did an amazing job of making me feel relaxed as well as listening to all of my concerns. I felt extremely relaxed when I left.   The staff is very friendly and very eager to help. I joined the club so I could continue feeling this good!
5 Why, why, why did I put off coming here for so long?  As for many Montrealers, the first snowstorm brought me a shovelling-induced wrenched back that I manfully thought I could treat with Scotch and Robax. I was wrong. For three whole weeks I was wrong. Manfully wrong, but wrong nonetheless. So at Oh-God hundred hours this morning I went online and booked a nine-thirty masso-therapist appointment.  Yep, within three hours I was answering health-related questions in preparation of a full-body reboot. The therapist really knew her stuff, finding and treating muscles that had been angry at me for months.  I haven't felt this good in seemingly forever. One or two more visits and I'll be back to Original Factory Settings!   The staff were all wonderful; friendly and professional, and the clinic  - being newly opened- was comfy, cozy, and clean.
5 The doctor was very good to me and treated me well. The staff is kind and there wasn't much of a wait. I plan to use them as my regular doctor from here on out. My favorite part was that there was not a long wait.
5 Dr Stewart and his staff are incredible! We started coming here after a car accident 2 years ago. My daughter had some pretty bad reactions to the accident. After 6 months, Dr Stewart had her straightened out (she literally had a crooked back)   Unfortunately we recently had to seek treatment after a second car accident. But knowing that the care we receive will get us back to our regular routines in a few weeks puts our mind at ease.   They are knowledgeable, friendly and caring. They have made my 8 year old daughter feel like the only client in the office when she's there. They listen to her stories, inquire about her ailment and respond to what she's feeling. She feels like they are her friends and looks forward to visiting everyone in the office.  I appreciate the thorough attention they give and the genuine interest in recovery. I wouldn't go anywhere else!
5 Love the dental clinic here. I got upper cosmetic veneers done and now I love my smile! It's a teaching facility, so appointments can take a long time, but its understandable since the student dentists need to get certain steps in a procedure checked by the faculty dentists.  The students are very professional, and I love how I got several different aspects from different dentists/faculty and student dentists. The costs for procedures here are very inexpensive compared to the private practice I used to go to! If you have insurance, you can get an insurance claim form at the end of the appointment. But I also believe they are starting to take insurances now. I think the two insurances they take are Aetna and Blue Cross Blue Shield.
1 Completely Unprofessional  My experience was horrible, the back story is that I was once a patient there. I moved but file was still with them.  I needed to get some insurance claim forms filled out, I called a week or so ago and they said that yes they have my complete file. I tried to get my family doctor complete the forms and unfortunately she couldn't and suggested I call Sheriden Medical to book an appointment and get the doctor to fill out the form. I called and booked an appointment, I tried to explain what the purpose was of my visit; unfortunately, the person answering the phone was minimally conversant speaking English. I got my appointment booked.  This turned in a fiasco, I waited there for 30 mins. I asked the receptionist if I need to see the doctor to have the forms filled out. She then advised me that no they can't assist me as this doctor I was seeking to see was not my family doctor. I attempted to explain that I was given the incorrect information as I had called in previously. Yes I was frustrated, her next response didn't help. She told me she was trying to help and not give her attitude. She then directed me to the next person who could give me my file. She re-iterated not to give her attitude as she was trying to help.  After my initial shock that they can address people like this, I tried to explain the fact that I can from Brampton to have this for filled out. I was trying to be rude, she cut me off. That's when I asked her not to interrupt. It was then that the Doctor came out and called my name. I explained he can't assist me and explained the situation. He said that we wasted your time and patted me on the shoulder. If the receptionist had the same attitude I would have shrugged, say I'm not happy but it happens. Instead they kept being belligerent, never saying sorry we made a mistake. She gave some documents, and when I didn't say thank you quick enough. She told me your welcome and have a nice day. I had to just walk away, this unprofessional-ism boggles my mind. The only saving grace was the Doctor I was scheduled to see, instead of having a chip on his shoulder and being unprofessional he was a true gentleman.
5 Dr. Dalessandro is unlike any doctor I've ever experienced. She saw things other doctors missed and is like an investigative reporter of feet. I feel blessed and super lucky to have accidentally gotten to have her see me. I have now made her my primary doctor in this office. Jenn and Crystal are her assistants and together, this is a medical team of my dreams. I've never experienced what a real medical staff, who really cares, can be like and it is amazing.   The front desk area...well is kinda chaotic and not super friendly (from the 5 visits I've had) but once you walk through the doors into the exam rooms...it's a whole different experience. Thank you so much Dr Dalessandro, Jenn and Crystal.
5 This was my first chiropractic experience. Admittedly I wasn't quite sure what to expect. From the moment I (barely)walked in the door to where I am today has been a remarkable experience. Dr Steve and his staff are what makes this office stand above the rest. It's not just about a smile and a "good morning", but you can truly see it in their eyes that they do care about you.  I have every confidence that my healing will continue to progress. I would recommend Dr. Steve and his staff to anyone that may be in need of a reputable chiropractor.
5 I have been seeing Dr. Nemanic now for almost two years. I initially went in because I have plantar fasciitis. He has helped me be able to continue to run and box, even with this condition. I count on him to put me back together before any of my race events. I have come to rely on his knowledge of the whole body as well. He has helped me figure out some other medical issues that my other doctors did not find.   Dr. Nemanic is very in tune with the whole body and how everything works together. Just because you have foot pain, it's not all in the foot. There may be other areas that are creating the problem. I have refereed many of my family and friends to his office and they all have been able to find relief and solutions to their problems. They are now return customers as well.  I would recommend Dr. Nemanic to anyone who has a health issue and needs answers. I am very grateful to have met him and will continue seeing him for all of my medical concerns.
3 I have been with this facility for years, the doctors are good, however, when they said they the patient first, I don't agreed 100%.   When I gave them my wellness form from my health insurance to fill in and fax it to my insurance. I provide a specific instruction and 2 originals. I told them I need 1 original back and have them make sure to have the doctor sign, print the name and dated. Then let me know to collect one of the original copy. Waited for more than a week, receive no call so I went to the office expected to collect my copy. The front office give a printed a copy of the original from the computer. The form does not had the printed doctor name and is not dated. When I ask for the original form, guess what, the lady at the front office again print an in filled form from the computer. I told her I want the form that I brought in for them to fill in, she said they shredded the form once they scanned it to the computer. This is terrible, this happened to me last year so I gave specific instructions when I gave them the form, so even after I provide them with specific instruction, it's USELESS. So they don't put you, the patient first, it's the procedure or rule FIRST. Come on be really, those advertisement are JUST A SLOGAN...
1 Dr. Shi is the most condescending Dr. I've ever come in contact with, and l've work in the medical field for years. She was in our room for a minute if that, had no empathy for my sick kiddo. Have no idea why this woman chose pediatrics, she has no bedside manner. Her office staff was nice, no wait time (I can see why now) Only saw her today because Dr. Schnitzler at the wigwam office was booked. Won't ever go back!
5 The staff at Coury Family Medicine are very professional and pleasant to be around. Dr. Coury is an excellent physician and always takes the time to listen to you as a patient. I am completely satisfied with the care I have received at this practice.
5 We've been a SEEK family for over a year now and have a profound appreciation for the care and education they offer. We have one typical child and one special needs child and they are both highly engaged and learning at impressive levels. The teachers are definitely highly qualified and care very much about the kids and their education and well being. The teachers are also supported by professionals and we work as a team to work with both kids. We're grateful for SEEK and would recommend anyone exploring SEEK as a learning solutions for other families.
5 The staff was very polite and the service was excellent. Had a very relaxing massage and will definitely make another appointment.
4 I do like the facility here.  It's very big with a large staff and very easy to get an appointment.  They've even been accommodating to me as a walk-in when I first got my concussion.  I was seen within a half hour and I didn't have an appointment.  I definitely can't complain about that.  You're able to make an appointment online (or at least make the request for the appointment), which is convenient.  There's a pharmacy on premises, which is always helpful when you don't want to make a second trip.  The only reason this is not a 5-star is because before I moved, my PCP was a one-man practice.  It's hard to get used to being one of hundreds of patients and not really getting a connection to a single doctor the way you can with a small practice.  I've been trying to see the same doctor (Kimberly Brabentz) and she is really good.
5 Dr. Daftari and his staff are great.  Thorough and professional.  I have been in pain for a long time and they have a plan not using drugs.  Even though they are prescribing meds, I am treated well.  Some places I have been treat me more like a criminal.  Nicole is also great and always friendly.
5 Carlos and staff are all amazing and very encouraging! Not only did they take great care of me while I was there for therapy, but right off the bat they sent me home with tools to also do exercises from home so I could always be working on strengthening my knee. I injured my knee so bad I was constantly wearing a knee brace and even using a cane for a bit. They quickly had me getting around without those items and in a few months I was back to most of my normal activities. I can't thank them enough!!!!!
1 Walked in Sunday morning and tried to ask a question.  The door was unlocked, I tried to get my question out 4 times and was cut off every time.  The staff at the front are extremly rude, If they don't want to be bothered they should leave the door locked until they are "open" instead of being short with people and giving attitude.   I've been here before and never had this issue before.  Ended up leaving due to the lack of customer service and extreme early morning bitchiness.  I will not be back here.
1 Worst place to apply at they say the are doing a background check, yet its a driving record check. What does that have to do with C.N.A work? Nothing! They are very unprofessional don't apply unless you like dysfunction. I wouldn't even give it a 1star, but I had to rate it.
1 Today I went in for an ingrown toenail and Dr. Forte... The owner, walked in, didn't even introduce herself and immediately started talking about my acne and how I should go on oral medicine for it. Not only was I NOT here for an acne consultation but I found it very offending. I am no longer going here.
5 I have been to dozens of chiropractors over the years as the result of playing sports and a serious car crash. Most chiropractors are adequate while there are a much smaller percentage of good ones. Then there are a very select number of talented & gifted chiropractors that are extremely hard to find. Dr Nemanic is one of these guys. Phoenix, you are lucky to have this guy. He confidently can do the tough adjustments with ease & understands the human body as well as any physiotherapist or MD. I have C1 and C2 problems and Dr Nemanic does these adjustments better than anyone I have ever been to (many chiropractors shy away from C1 and C2 adjustments). I highly recommend Dr Nemanic.
4 Fast and easy process! The doctor answers all questions and explains everything to ensure you understand.
5 Dr. Talley is one of the best doctors we have seen.  Our family has been going to her for years now.  She will see everyone in your family children and adults alike.  Se always takes the time to listen.  She will test/ treat or medicate as necessary but does not just jump to perscribing antibiotics.  She has a wonderful and balanced approach to medicine.  She is very friendly and extremely caring.  We have never had a problem getting an appointment even for a sick visit always within 24hrs.  Times when the sick visit was urgent her staff would find a way to get you in.  For children she always gives a very thorough annual exam.
1 My wife went to see Dr. Izadmanesh, based on a referral from Summerlin Hospital.  Went in on a Friday for an x-ray, and waited over a week for results, even though my wife left four messages for an update and callback from Dr. Izadmanesh.   The doctor and staff were unresponsive and did not return any calls. Nearly impossible to speak to someone on the phone due to their automated voice system.   Will never use this office again and would not recommend them.
5 I really like Dr.Reddy and his staff. Dr. Reddy takes his time to listen to you and address all you issues. He is sometimes difficult to book because he is in high demand, so I will see Marlina Robinson who is amazing! She is so compassionate and caring. I feel like she s my close friend because she has shown how much she cares about me and my health. I went through a difficult time and she was there to support me emotionally, as well as throughly her medical care. She is one of the most caring providers I have met. I definitely recommend her and Dr. Reddy.
4 Very useful facility, it was New Years eve and I needed my prescription refilled. My pharmacy could not do auto fill since my doctor denied it. Now I was caught off guard, since when I get my auto dial from them. I assume its just a reminder for my prescription. Apparently they were trying to notify me that my doctor denied it! Well my doctor office was closed for the day and I had to get my prescription. This place brought me in and checked me out, and gave me a prescription. I would have been out of my medicine for about four days.  Great place, nice people
1 I just fired these guys as my provider. I found an excellent family practice doctor who doesn't game the system to fill his pockets. There is enough honest money out there for those that are willing to work for it.Warner just sent me an e mail stating they will be requiring certain tests on my physical which "may not" be covered by my hyper expensive insurance and I will be required to pay out of pocket. RUN from these guys!
5 This place is fabulous!! Dr Diorio is an amazing chiropractor and the staff is always pleasant and courteous.  Victoria, Martha, Mariah, and Erika always keep a smile on their faces and a pep in their step!  Highly recommend this place
5 I have had 3 surgeries by Dr. Frank Raia. One in 2012, 2013 and just had one on December 9th, 2015. I have been very pleased with every surgery. Tried seeing another doctor at the Core Institute and it didn't work out. Long drive to see Dr. Raia but well worth it. Very pleasant, understanding and puts up with my excessive talking. Very professional but still has a smile for ya when you come out of surgery. He explains everything exactly how it will go before and after surgery and has not failed me in any way. Whether you travel 25 or 45 miles, he is the hand surgeon you need to see. Hope he never leaves the Core Institute. These doctor's don't have long periods of time to talk to you, but listening to them is very important. Do all the tests they ask you to do and if surgery is needed, they will be the first to discuss it with you. By the way, this surgery was carpal tunnel release and trigger finger release on right hand. Doing quite well.
1 I scheduled a free consultation which went fine for the the most part. They appeared overbooked and Dr. Kim seemed rushed because of it. I spent less than 5 minutes talking to him but got a good vibe from him and his reviews as a physician were very good so I scheduled a procedure. I asked that they verify that the procedure would be covered by my insurance BEFORE my appointment. Two days before my appointment, I called to verify that it was in fact covered and things went downhill from there. The staff couldn't answer the question and kept saying they'd call me back. No call back even after speaking to 3 different girls, 3 different times. I called again the day before before my appointment and got the same thing! No one would answer my question! I kept being put on hold and then told someone in their insurance department would call me back. After another couple of calls because of no call back, they asked for my insurance information again because they couldn't find it! All the calls I made and they finally decided to tell me they couldn't find my insurance information. Yeah, no thanks! I cancelled my appointment. My suggestion to Dr. Kim is for him to clean house and get rid of the clearly inexperienced staff, OR get a manager in his office that can train his employees properly as YOU ARE LOSING CUSTOMERS! Is no one in that office reading these reviews?  Additionally, the reception area at the Thomas location is too small and needs work. Cheap pleather couches and metal folding chairs......not a good look.
1 My brother in law needed back surgery asap. Heard about CORE and called right away. On hold several times for over 20 minutes. Was promised that their patient relations person would call to explain. No call. Ever. 2 days later was booked and had surgery completed by competitor. I'm sure the docs are fab but front office is killing the business.
5 I've been going here for probably around 5 years, maybe longer. Dr Steve is great!   I found this place purely by accident because my back went out and he was open to see me on a Saturday. While his office is not very close to where I live, I prefer going to him because he fixes me up just right. Other chiropractors I've been to are overly gentle when sometimes I need a doctor who will put some muscle into it so that I can actually heal.  The adjustment also includes therapy like muscle stem or whatever applies to your ailement. My issue is a rotating hip and sometimes my low back just goes out or I just need a good crack of the neck and he gets it done right.  Highly recommend this place even if other chiropractors are closer to you - Dr Steve is the best chiropractor I've had!
1 I would like to speak to the care or lack thereof provided by Pro Care. The physical therapist/owner was one of the nicest people you could encounter. However, his approach to my husband's total replacement was anything but desirable. After 8 weeks and 20 visits the surgeon demanded my husband abandon Pro Care and use another company to ensure proper treatment so my husband's future ability to be mobile would return. Pro Care did VERY little in strength and balance for the new knee. After eight weeks he could barely walk. His goal was only to obtain flexibility. As an estimation my husband's recovery is maybe four weeks (he says six) behind schedule. With the new PT provider the life has returned to my husband's eyes. He is walking very nicely and the strength and balance are returning to his knee.   We felt a provider listed on the Banner approved list and were told they follow the prescribed protocols set by Banner we would have great results. How we were fooled. Banner should follow up with providers to ensure their patients are getting the best treatment before adding a provider to their approved list.   The goal of this writing is to make people aware. We felt a very local provider would be a great benefit to the community. Now we feel bad if everyone gets the same type of treatment. Pro Care may have great results with some things but maybe staying up to date as to treatments would make them a better provider. We would never recommend this provider to anyone. This is tough to say because of the people who work there are very nice individuals. But nice does not make them a good Physical Therapy team.
2 Already been here three  hours, after spending two hours at a walk in (that sent me here).  Frustrating to see nurses an doctors chilling out, hanging out, (when not yelling at the cleaning staff), and not a single patients name has been called since I've been here.  It is not that busy (probably other people know to go anywhere but here).  There has to be a better hospital, but I don't know the area well enough - so I'm stuck.  (May come back after performing self surgery...which may actually be safer, and cleaner - certainly faster!)    They do have cops here though - in case patients get out of hand waiting.  Who have been assholes to some patients...(still have not seen a doctor). (Oh, and to tell me not to take pictures).  This is the only "attention" you will get at this hospital...
2 I wanted a general practitioner just in case something happened, and once I found out they do lady appointments too, I thought 'great, one stop shop.'  I stayed with Peppertree for a year and a half and I'm over it.  Don't come here.  It's not the medical and nursing staff - they're fine.  It's everything else.  If you call for an appointment, be ready to wait on hold for at least 10 minutes before you get to talk to someone...every single time.  I've waited for 25 minutes before getting tired and hanging up.  And I can't forget the time that I'd already been on hold for 15 minutes when the main St. Joe's operator picked up and told me that the entire Peppertree staff had just left for lunch and wouldn't be back for another hour or so.  He suggested I call before the lunch hour next time.  "I did.  15 minutes ago.  I've been on hold."     The people at the reception desk are bored at best and rude at worst.  They're irritated at you for standing in front of them.  Don't expect to see the same doctor over and over again.  Want to create a trusting patient/doctor relationship?  Won't happen.  In the year and a half I went to Peppertree, I saw 4 different doctors.  The first doctor I saw there ended up moving but I wasn't informed until I went to make a follow up appointment with her.  No letter informing me of her departure... nothing.  I started seeing a new one but when I needed a certain lady procedure, they said they'd only do it on a certain day and the doctor that had already been up in my business wasn't working then.  So someone else got to poke around up in there.  There are more stories, but I think I've made my point.  Finally, after making the decision to switch, I went in to fill out all the paperwork to obtain my medical records.  It's been a month and I still don't have them.  I called to follow up and I was transferred FIVE times because no one thought it was their responsibility.  Eventually I end up with someone who was able (willing?) to track down my request...she says they were sent.  I never got them.  No problem, she says, she'll send them again... but it's going to have to be 10 cents a page.   *facepalm*
4 Got a group on!! I am a first timer to bikram  and I really liked it..I have not been to other in Arizona  but this is well maintained and the teachers are good.. Unable to make it all days of the week..but three days per week is not that bad. I really likes it..it feels like you after you come out of asteam bath and i get goooood sleep :) definitely going to take a package when my Groupon subscription ends
1 Horrible bedside manner! Sitting in the patient room waiting for 40+ min. Listening the the staff screaming at each other, complaining about something! Horrible service!!!
1 The place looks nice. The doctor was impatient and unwilling to help. He had the same kind of attitude with another person that wanted to ask a question. Go there at your own risk.
5 I want to thank Dr. Gary for saving me from shoulder surgery last month.  If it wasn't for him taking the time with me, I would've had unnecessary surgery last month.  Thank you so much!! I'm doing great now thanks to him, physical therapy and a cortisone shot.  Great Dr.!!
2 I've always liked every doctor I've seen here, but the service has gone downhill.  I called in last week to get an emergency prescription refill and they said they would call it in.  About 2 hours later I called my pharmacy and they said they had received nothing.  Called back again and the receptionist put me on hold for a long time then came back & said "OK, now it should be sent".  No apology, no explanation.  Went in again yesterday just to get labs.  by 45 minutes after my appointment time I went up to ask what was going on and the receptionist called the lab and said nobody was answering.  She said she would try to find out what was going on so I sat back down and 10 minutes later they finally called me back.  I can totally understand that things can get backed up for various reasons and appointments can sometimes be late but I'd at least expect some acknowledgement of the situation, like "I'm sorry you've had to wait so long, we're really backed up today" or something.
5 I have been a patient of Dr. Nelson's for about 10 years.  You can't find  another caring person in her profession.  Her PA LaCosta is the greatest.  The entire staff at Desert Ridge Family Physicians should be commended for their caring and professionalism.
5 Dr. Gruber is awesome. Very friendly and caring. Sure the wait was long, but he was worth the wait. He took care of my needs and made sure I was comfortable with everything we did each step of the way. I will be back. Can't thank them enough for all of their help here.
1 Reading the prior reviews,  I think I must have visited the wrong place.  I  was assigned Alex, who seemed unable to find any trigger points to help to relieve my shoulder.  In the  past a therapist has moved my arm in order to diagnose where the issue is,  He proceeded to use one hand and  lazily pinch my shoulders, for a half hour, never getting to an area that would cause release of pain.  Similarly he seemed not to deal with my neuropathy,  He asked few questions.  When my hour was up, I felt the same as when I came in, took all my pains with me.  He is one therapist I would not recommend.
5 Bought a Groupon for 45 minute Full Body Hot Stone Massage ($29) and it was worth every penny. This place is definitely one of those hidden gems you dont even notice you drive by daily.   My masseuse was Eriko and she was excellent. Here is the highlight of my visit: - they ask you what areas you want to focus on and they really work on those areas in the session. - they have a set timer but Eriko stayed past her time to make sure she finished the full work completely. - full body here means head to toe, back and front, and a bit of face. Most places only do back and front, so I was pleasantly surprised by these added extras.  - as they do reflexology work too, the masseuse seem to know the right "pressure points" that work really well for me. They also tell you if you have other tight areas and work on those. - I asked for them to work on my feet and I think they did a bit of foot reflexology even though it wasn't part of my package - so that was a big plus. - they offer you water or rice tea at the end of your visit. The tea makes the experience really "complete" (or maybe I was just thirsty then). - plenty of free parking available. If not, it's just a 10 minute walk west from Finch subway station.  Overall, this place was great! The only bad thing I can think of from this place is their skipping music track, but it really is no big deal. And don't be fooled by their "office looking space" - the rooms are clean and are exactly as the pictures shown here. Half the time you will be asleep anyway from the awesome massage and your masseuse soothing voice. :)  I would definitely recommend this place for those looking to try out for something good and affordable.
5 Staff treats you like family. The treatments they give you really make you feel better
5 I have been seeing PA Courteny Barnes now for a few months now and I absolutely love her!  She is so down to earth and I feel as a patient communicating with her is so easy.  I moved to Vegas a few years ago and had tried another office before finding Forte Family Practice.  I have referred several of my coworks to the office and will continue to do so!  Such stella office staff!
2 I've given up on this practice, not because of the doctors but because of their disinterested and condescending front staff.  I even tested to see if I wasn't being touchy. I had my wife listen over speaker phone one of my conversations with the staff. Her jaw dropped at how rude and simply "over it" they are.  It's a shame, but I'm not returning to doctors I like, simply because I don't want to deal with their office.
5 I have been to many doctors in many states an I can honestly say that Dr. Banister is the best doctor I have been to. She is so great that I switched my daughter and husbands doctors to her. She is unlike any other doctor because she spends as much time talking to you as you need. Also when I went back to her she remembered what we had talked about previously and asked about a prior problem. The front desk staff is polite and her nurse is personal and very friendly. Dr Heidi Banister is the best doctor!
1 This place is a total nightmare! I went in for routine follow up bloodwork. They make you make an appointment, wait for way over an hour, pay a copay, get your vitals taken and see the doctor for about 4 minutes before they draw the blood- the only thing you went for. They told me it would be about a week for my results. Two weeks, several messages and emails later I get fed up and called the main office. I was on hold for over 45 minutes to be told they can't give me results over the phone. So I am terrified at this point because they tell me they can't tell me ANYTHING over the phone, that I have to speak to the doctor in person. I freak out and rush right over (because he's only available a couple days a week) to sit there and wait for just slightly under two hours, pay a copay, get my vitals taken, see the doctor for under a minute for routine results. I wasted so many hours, got so angry and stressed out for nothing at all. Then he wants me back in 2 months when 6 months is standard. Absolutely not. Worst experience ever from start to finish.
5 I have been a patient of Dr. Brad Sorosky for several years.  I am not exaggerating by stating that he and his practice have allowed me to return to a level of fitness and health that I was told I would never again achieve.  When I initially went to Dr. Brad, I found him to be a partner in my recovery.  He always listened to my concerns, gave me several options to address issues and always made me feel like I was of utmost importance whenever I was in his office.  I also have seen Dr. Susan Sorosky and can't say enough about her talent in quickly identifying the root cause of an issue.  I went to three doctors who were uncertain of diagnosis and at my first visit, she identified the cause which was later confirmed by MRI.   Additionally both doctors and their office have actively fought to ensure I received insurance approval for appropriate diagnostic testing and treatment.   And Kristy at the East Valley office has always been incredibly kind when I have had a bad flare up and called when in pain.  The epidural injections have been a lifesaver for me.   I have referred numerous friends and family members and they have all thanked me for the referral. Hands down the best physicians and office in their field.
5 Been going here for a few months and see Lupita, she is absolutely wonderful! I highly recommend her if you like medium pressure and focus on neck and shoulders.
5 Dr. Bakty and her staff go above and beyond in service.  Dr. Bakty's knowledge of traditional medicine along with her studies in Naturapathic medicine give her a unique perspective and ability to best serve her patients.  I am happy to have found her and the options she provided in lieu of invasive surgery.
1 The lady that deals with the patients is nice. The doctors will tell you to get procedures you do not need. The doctors also say your insurance will cover it 100% and then send you a bill. Do not go there! Derek S
4 It's ok. It's not like amazing. I went in due to an allergic reaction to something,but the night before I had an "aha" moment and I figured it out myself. Needless to say I still went in. Dr. Chang is cool. I told her everything I felt was going on with me and she waited and then responded accordingly. All the nurses are friendly and took their time with me. The only drawback for me was the front restroom was gross! I came in this morning and it didn't look like anyone cleaned it the day before! Ugh! And I have a thing about restrooms. Other than that, everything else was normal.
2 UPDATE: Extra star for Janel Hillstrom who was great, and If I had an entire afternoon to waste in the waiting room again, I would come back just for her. She is quite amazing.   It's officially an hour after my scheduled appointment. Well let me rephrased that. Appointment they took upon themselves to reschedule because the doctor I saw two weeks ago chose not to stay with the practice. The same doctor who ordered a slew of blood tests and a pulmonary function test and put me on a "treatment" plan. Now I'm waiting hours to see another who will have no idea about what's going on and I'll have to explain all over. Did i mention she will be the third (3) doctor/pseudo doctor I will be seeing in my three (3) visits at this craphole? Last time i waited two hours to see anyone and had to prove to that the previous doctor that I was prescribed certain medication by physically showing him the bottles. He claimed there was nothing about it in my chart and he was glad that I had the bottle with me. They will try and rip you off on copays so be careful if you do choose this mess. I'm just waiting to get my medical records before I head to a different place this Wednesday. Stay far far away! Yes I love spending 3 hours on a Saturday at a disorganized mess of a shithole while I have a six month old I could be spending time with.
5 I trust this place like family! Everyone is so kind and always looking out for my best interest. I've been going on and off for years and love the staff there. They do sooooo much more than just an adjustment. Physical therapy, muscle work (aka a chair massage!!) essential oils. I took my baby in for an adjustment when we was just days old - they even do things like help with his flat spot on his head and opening his tiny sinuses when he's sick. I'm so grateful to have a chiropractic office I can trust.    I've been going to Dr. Jenny the longest and few like she knows by body and what I need but the other chiropractors at this location are also really great and have treated me a few times as well.
5 I absolutely love dr. Que . I'm a hair stylist and stand on my feet for hours , so when I found this facility I can say that I found my cure for my achy legs and head aches. The whole staff is very informative and friendly . The atmosphere is calming and relaxing unlike some other pain management places I have been to that seem cold and sterile .
4 Very nice Family Practice.  They are new to this location, starting back in November 2014.  Everyone was very friendly and knowledgeable at the office.  They have 4 Drs/Practitioners to choose from . Also, you are not bound to 1 Dr., you can float between them all.    They open early and stay open till 7pm normally, so they can work around your schedule.   I just went in for a checkup, but they seem well adapted to handle a lot of things.
2 I had to get my annual physical examination done. Never thought it would take more than an hour, when there wasn't even a lot of crowd. The front desk was courteous & helpful but that's where my good experience ended.  Showed up at scheduled 12:45 PM , got done only at 2:10 PM when all they did was weight, health, blood pressure, waist circumference , & tethoscopic inspection ( blood work was lab-ordered as it had to be done fasting.
5 As a local massage therapist, I frequently refer clients to the team at Bloor Bathurst for their physiotherapy needs.  I've received very positive feedback every time!  Clients are impressed by the comprehensive approach and advanced techniques.  They are really made to feel that their needs are being looked after.  We will continue to confidently refer patients here, and feel very fortunate to have Luis and his colleagues in the neighbourhood!
5 As a PA student that recently rotated at AMC for 6 weeks, I must say this clinic has some of the most compassionate and knowledgeable providers and staff! Whether you see one of the MDs, PAs, or NP, you are sure to be treated as a whole person and not simply an illness. The patient population at AMC is extremely diverse and the clinic is more than equipped to accommodate patients of all ethnicities and languages. The extended clinic hours allow patients to work around their busy schedules, and the on-site lab is also very convenient for ordered lab work. If you need to bring your children in for a check-up, or even just along to your own appointment, there are movies playing in most patient rooms and even games in the waiting room! Lastly, the providers at AMC are passionate about incorporating their patients' faith into their overall healthcare experience, which is certainly a unique element to this practice. I would hight recommend AMC to all who are looking for a warm, compassionate, and knowledgeable primary care provider!
5 Dr. Sharma is amazing! I have had horrible experiences here in Las Vegas. First off the $75 payment for someone without insurance is great  verses others that require $200 deposit before you are seen bc you do not have insurance. Finding this Dr is a blessing. I had a mini stroke and it has been a very scary situation & he made me feel so comfortable & confident that we will find the cause. He is very compassionate. I am telling everyone I know that they must check out Dr. Sharma.
5 I've been going here for a few months now and could not be more impressed. The staff goes above and beyond to make you feel cared for. They have very convenient appointment times, a nice, clean facility and staff that is passionate about your well-being. If you like the idea of being treated as if you are part of the family then this is the place for you. I highly recommend South Mountain Physical Therapy.
5 Ich war vor kurzem das erste Mal hier. Habe mich ziemlich schlecht gefühlt und wollte so bald wie möglich vorbeikommen. Habe zuvor dort angerufen und die Dame am Telefon bat mich auch, schnellstmöglich zu kommen, da es nachmittags dann nicht mehr ginge.. So weit, so gut. Die Damen empfand ich nicht als übermäßig freundlich. Ich saß dann fiebrig und fantasierend ;) 1,5 bis 2 Stunden im Wartezimmer. Ziemlich deprimierend, so viele Leute kommen und gehen zu sehen, während ich immer noch wartete. Es war aber auch richtig viel los.. Schließlich war es dann aber soweit und ich lernte Herrn Dr. Klenk kennen, der äußerst freundlich war und sehr gelassen wirkte. Er nahm sich Zeit für mich als Menschen, nicht als Nummer xy im Wartezimmer. Obwohl ich zuvor immer skeptisch gegenüber homöopathischen Mitteln war, nahm ich das, was er mir aufschrieb und konnte gar nicht glauben, wie fantastisch es wirkte.  Fühle mich zwar momentan kerngesund, sollte sich das aber ändern, werde ich mit Sicherheit wieder hierhin kommen ;)
1 Even with an appointment I have waited about 2 hours to be seen.  This place is not professional at all.  The girl at the front desk is very rude (the one with the curly hair that sits on the left) rolled her eyes at me as if I was a bother.  One time I called on a holiday and some guy answered with his music really loud and said the office was closed.  I will be switching Doctors office... I'm scared even to do my blood work there since they don't even wear gloves when taking out your blood.... An inspector should look into this clinic.
5 this has been the most amazing experience , Jolli is very informative,  about the therapy,  and what it all entails. . Her office was so clean, and very nicely decorated. .! she is very knowledgeable of the differnt things HIDING in your bms.  she made me feel very relaxedand comfortable,  After each session we would chat and she would always ask me how I am feeling, and offer me fresh fruits and vegetables,  before leaving.... I completed my 1st three session three weeks in a row and she always made sure to keep me in the same time slot, so that we are consistent in my detox... Also I was interested in a liver,  gallbladder clease , so Jolli, made sure thar my next session she had a list of the things I would need and the instructions on what to do..If there is one thing you should do for yourself and your health, is make an appointment,  and try one out for youself you wont be disappointed at all.  THANK YOU JOLLI.
5 Dr Sharma is a good man, and thourough. (Lebowski quote) I wanted an actual Doctor vs. The procare/quickcare I'd been relying on for a while because they always seem to RX the same zpack/cough syrup/nasal spray package regardless of what I have as a sickness and lately don't even seem to try to figure out what I have just RX meds. In January I got really sick and am pretty sure it wasn't diagnosed as serious as it was. Now sick again in March with lingering shortness of breathe from January's bronchitis(?) I read Dr. Sharma's yelp reviews and I'm glad I did. In and out in less than an hour for a new patient was good enough for me. Friendly listened and RX a steroid to get rid of possible chest infection from Jan. and antibiotic for current sickness (sinus infection?). Friendly, patient and efficient. Seemed to remember and be familiar with his existing patients. Didn't RX seemingly unnecessary things. When I asked for natural remedies he had some suggestions there too. I will go here from now on. They accept walk-ins and if you don't have insurance there's a flat fee for appointments as well.
5 Northwest Family Physicians is the best!  I have been going there for about 10 years or more. Incredible service all around.   Dr. Larsen is my favorite physician ever. He is very personable, friendly, and professional - - and even in these fast times, ALWAYS takes time to listen intently to every concern (even if I have a list) without judgement - a model for all doctors to follow and live up to.  He's very logical and thorough, so I know there is no stone left unturned.  And it's always clear during these discussions that he is up-to-date on the latest in medicine. I moved to Durham, NC, over a year ago and he's still my primary physician!  Wouldn't have it any other way!  Dr. Larsen's nurses are also great - friendly, professional, and very attentive (won't name names - don't want to miss anyone).
1 I won't go back. Here's why.  1: Misdiagnosis: One doc I won't name couldn't figure out what was wrong with me on one occasion so she writes 2 scripts, recommends tests, and sends me on my way $120 lighter for the visit, plus $130 in script costs. When her scripts fail to work I snap a picture of the problem and send it to a family doctor / Hospital Chief Of Staff we know in Nebraska. She immediately diagnosed it, recommended over the counter stuff and I was healed in 72 hours. And when I told the COS what the scripts were she laughed and said Seriously? She gave you THAT? You wasted your money!  2: Book a 15 min appoint to make sure you cover your issues, she rushes through and doesn't seem to really listen to you.  3: Won't renew even simple scripts for $4 meds without an expensive doctor's visit.  4: Loves to make referrals and especially to labs. Lots and lots of lab work.  5: Front desk staff: Overworked and it shows.   In short, Las Vegas healthcare already has a bad rap. This clinic does not help the perception problem one bit.
1 The front desk staff is beyond poor. All this clinic wants is to push more pills on you.  The doctors don't even seem to know what they are talking about, which makes sense since the front desk workers are legitimately so under qualified to even deal with simple paperwork.  Customer service is non existing.  Do not go to this clinic.
1 BEWARE NEVER EVER GO HERE!!!! I would give 0 stars if possible. This office is disgusting and the Doctors are unprofessional and unorganized. They are being investigated.
5 I've been seeing Dr. Herrera and Jenna (PA) for several years, since CCM first opened. Dr: Herrera and Jenna are awesome, but they book out far in advance often. Recently, I saw Kyle (PA) and he was awesome as well. I highly recommend Dr. Herrera, Dr. Smith, Jenna and Kyle. I've seen their other providers, but none made me feel comfortable like the providers I mentioned.
5 I normally go to the Durango location, but it was urgent, so this is the location that could get me in the same day.   Dr. Baird had the best bedside manner of the four docs I've worked with through this organization (it is of note that they all rotate around locations).   Understanding that I was between health insurance, he figured out a plan that kept costs as minimal as possible (from treatment, to meds he prescribed).   The front desk girls were friendly.
2 I think this location is in great need of more Physical Therapists, as I believe, from going to this place 5X, there's only one overburdened Physical Therapist and too many Assistants, who could be trained to do more hands-on work.  This was my first time going for Physical Therapy and, having once worked in a Chiropractic Office, I had a basis for comparison.  There were times I left there in similar pain, as when I arrived.  The assistants need to supervise more.  I ended one exercise, no assistant in sight to supervise, and I found her in a side office on her Smartphone.  Not very professional IMO.  I won't be going back.
2 UPDATE: While my rating is still low, I gave an extra star due to the fact that I was contacted by the business owner who accepted responsibility instead of making excuses. I've had a better experience at this location a year or two back and may have run into a glitch this go around.  I may be big on customer service and proper follow up, but it is what it is. If I'm told that I'm going to be contacted back after my insurance is verified so that I can schedule an appointment for treatment, then I'd like to be contacted. This didn't happen when I contacted the office. I heard back from one of the owners right away, but when it came down to the staff following up on coverage, the ball got dropped big time. I contacted a different chiro office, was verified within 15 minutes, and scheduled and have been treated twice already. My wife is also scheduled to be treated this week. Maybe if I'd have walked in and stood there I would have gotten better service, but who knows?
1 I visited a year and a half ago. Yes, a year and a half ago and I'm writing this now.   I knocked myself out in a sports accident and ended up waking up and fumbling towards the nearest person who could drive me to the ER. We got there, I got put in a chair, and wheeled to a bed. Good.   Nurses were examining my forehead and top of my head where some bruises were. They failed to check the back of my head. Turns out I had a big gash that had oozed out blood slowly which I found out by simply grabbing the back of my head in pain. I had to tell them that the back of my head hurt before they even looked at it.   A few minutes later they were in another room about 40 feet away with the door open. I heard one nurse say, "What should we do? Should we give him stitches?" which didn't bother me but kind of threw me off when I heard it. I figured she was a newbie. I could tell they were talking to the doctor. I could hear them talking about staples and then a nurse came over talking and preparing me to get two staples.   Later on the only doctor there (some out of shape old white guy about 5'8" 160lbs in his late 50s) came to my bed with the medical stapler in hand and didn't even formally greet himself (which I didn't care at the time cause I was just trying not to fall asleep). So he immediately sat himself down and asked me what my name was. I responded thinking it was a test to see if I remembered who I was, because this same guy was just talking about me 5 minutes ago in another room. Then he asked me where I lived. I said the city, and he repeated the question again, so I told him my exact address, still thinking this was one of those tests. He then asked, "What are doing all the way out here?" I explained my situation. He then asked, "Why weren't you wearing a helmet? Hmm?" I didn't respond right away because the question threw me off, and my body was on the verge of falling asleep. He then asked, "Are you too cool for a helmet?" In that sort of tone like, "Was it you that chewed up the furniture and pooped on the carpet? Hmm?"   He completely dismissed the injury at that point. He wanted to make it personal. Probably because he doesn't get the chance to tell off younger males in the slow city of Boulder on a regular basis. I knew he would help me, but it was a matter of when. So I said to him in frustration, "Can you please just help me?"  He sat there for a second taking it in. He then bent my head forward and put one staple in. Then the 2nd (and last) staple. I could see his body move a lot just to get the second one in. And I could feel the second one go in crooked (not parallel with the 1st). I thought maybe the wound was shaped like that. But I thought that he was probably just being too quick to put them in. SO I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT HE PURPOSELY MESSED UP ON THE STAPLES until I got home and checked with two mirrors. Pic related.   And so after he got done with the staples he said, "Maybe you should wear a helmet next time." In that same tone while not looking at me when he said it. I could sense the tension. He hated me because I'm simply a young male. He walked back to his desk. Mind you the desk was literally 30ft in front of the foot of the bed I was at. A few minutes later he calls over some nurses to randomly talk to them about what to do if a patient gets violent. I'm just laying there listening to this, figuratively shaking my head. Later on I got my head further examined and then I went home.   I have attached a picture with the fully healed scar a year and a half later, today. As you can see, the 2nd staple left a crooked mark from the skin being pulled together on the lower right. The wound itself was a straight line.   If you live in Boulder City I would advise you to not go to this hospital, in all sincerity.
5 Dr. Galli is an AMAZING dr. She treats you like family and honestly cares about your success after surgery.  Her MA Abel is the bomb. He jokes and kids with you and is on top of any concerns. If you have the need for a foot surgeon, please check them out. My experience with the Core Institute,  including their physical therapy department has been nothing but outstanding. I highly recommend them.  Bonnie
5 My new gym and I love it!  First time I've had a 'posh' gym membership. Normally I end up working out in the 'muscle' type gym's but for convenience, opening hours and facilities, I signed up to the Nuffield. It is not cheap but worth the money if you go regularly.  Clean, plentiful equipment in working order. Large range of classes at times to suit any needs and the pool is fantastic. I do love the steam room as well with its dark ceiling, fairy lights and menthol steam.   To start, I had a health MOT - working out at 6am meant I could get this the morning after registering so all the height, weight and cardio measurements taken. Then the next day I was set my customised programme, based on what I wanted to achieve and what I liked doing. This part I like as if I don't like something, I'll not do it so my instructor listening to me was great :-) Check up will follow two months after the first assessment and then my programme will be modified so I don't get bored.  I am a gym, equipment and pool kinda gal so I can't comment on the classes. The facilities are lovely and clean anytime I've been in and the babyliss hairdryers are really powerful so this is a bonus.  All in all, really love it here. Happy working out 5-6 days per week and more than getting my £43 worth a month.
5 I have been a patient for over seven years and Dr. Pat Dietzgen is the best doctor I've ever had. Her and her staff are always comforting and caring and I can usually get an appointment right away when I'm sick. Her husband, Dr. Mark Dietzgen has helped me with acupuncture treatments and supplements. I would highly recommend their practice to anyone seeking a primary care doctor.
5 I have been a patient of MVFP for over 10 years.  I have a great Dr. (Roseann Collins). And I find them to be organized and efficient.  Nothing but good experience with them. Richard
1 Especially the office located on McDowell in Goodyear IMS.  The medical assistants (who go to school for how many months?) are righteous, know it all, disrespectful, no patient customer service skills, poor attitude, argumentative, won't listen to the patient, won't get the correct message to the provider, late, always in break room eating food that the pharmaceutical reps bring, and condescending.  I give the star to the nice medical records, Peggy.  I have given this practice several chances because I liked the provider, but now they lose my business.  I have choices in healthcare and need to be in control of my choices, not scolded when asking a question to the MA regarding my care.  I have a big family and we are all transferring care out of this practice.  I wonder if these unprofessional assistants would have acted the same if they knew I am a healthcare administrator........for over three decades.
5 They do an excellent job. All the therapists are great. Office staff is organized and helpful.
5 I love this studio.  Everyone is wonderful.  I have had the best sessions ever here.  The best part is the lovely cool scented towel that happens at the end.    My favorite class is the "biltmore express", which is only an hour long.  It's quick and while it doesn't seem like it, that makes it a bit easier.    The staff is very caring and friendly.  All the other people who come to the studio are also very friendly.  This is my favorite studio I have been to anywhere in the phoenix area.    Hot yoga isn't easy, and it isn't for the faint of heart.  But remember, everyone else in the class is way too busy focusing on surviving the class themselves.  They don't care how "perfect" your pose is, or if you spend half the class flat on your back.  You stayed in the room, you made it.  Everyone has been there, and even the most accomplished yogis have "off" days and have to do it.  Just do you and you'll be fine :)
5 Dr. CHAD Campbell only doc your WHOLE family needs to see. Awesome.  He was on Shea / Tatum at PV fam medical e but left last year or two, any my family FOLLOWED him.  I tired other docs at PV fam Med but no go.  (I loved his assistant Nicole as well but the girls at Southeast Medical are also very sweet, thorough and QUICK too!)  So I see Dr. Campbell (40) my husband 33, daughter 23 (FYI She just graduated UofA she still called him for anything, and made the quick trip to see him if needed. I also have s 17 yr old, plays sports, a 6 yr old and a 2 yr old.    He is just awesome, like a great friend, not condesending, smart, genuine, quick, INSTINCTUAL!  Tell him everything, let him get to know you and he will do all that is necessary to make sure you are cared for, especially if you COMMUNICATE with him.  Follow up with him on medical care, meds, everything.     Honestly, I still live in North Scottsdale but drive the 101 to the 60 off on Country Club - 17 mins. Out of office in 30 - 40 min or so maybe depending on what we are seeing him for.   I just can't say enough but I must add that I've referred SEVERAL friends and their families and they ALL love him!
5 I don't normally give reviews, but in this case I felt I needed to let people know how nice and thorough Dr. Gupta is. She really cares about her patients and it really shows! She listens and makes you feels vey comfortable. Her office staff is professional and I have never had a problem scheduling an appointment.
1 Brighton Family Medicine has been my only doctor when I lived in Vegas, unfortunately it pains me to write this review because I adore Dr. Kim and the staff and unfortunately the other doctor, Dr. Vasso Anest who works for him has treated me unethically and unfairly. Dr. Vasso saw me one week while I was sick and Dr. Kim was out of the office- she took over my account (even though I wanted to see Dr. Kim) and continue to be my primary physician. I had moved to New York back in August and since my insurance was one from the west coast it was hard to find a good primary care doctor out in NYC. Like most of you, I am very particular with who I see for my health so it takes some time to find someone who will care for me and my family. Back in February, I ran out of my birth control so I tried to call Brighton family medicine for refill. Over the course of two months, I called several times a week in towards the month of March I called several times a day to try and get my birth control refilled. The staff there was very helpful and friendly however they said they sent it to several different pharmacies and it never showed up. Or it showed up at the wrong one, there was always an issue. I was leaving out of the country for a month and I was desperately wanting a refill, but the staff continued to have an issue. On the day that I was supposed to leave, yet again my birth control was nowhere to be found and I find that really feeling this prescription is fairly easy. I wrote an email, directed at the practice in general, no one specific, where you could easily hear my frustration and I did use the word "incompetent", because to me it didn't make sense that this was something I had spoken to several people over and over again about. I never received a response, and when I came back Dr Kim graciously refilled my prescription. I had asked one more time for a prescription refill, and the woman at the front desk was really kind and I had told her that I had just found a doctor that seem to measure up to Dr Kim. I sent over my prescription and I arrived again at CVS and there was nothing to be found. Obviously upset because the same issue happened again, I called Brighton family medicine and Dr. Vasso (who wouldn't speak to me directly) told her staff to tell me that I need to find a new doctor it's been 11 months, that I wrote a nasty email and that she wouldn't refill a basic prescription. I find her response completely out rages and rude, because the email was never directed to her or anyone specific. This practice usually had high standards and service, so when the quality of service wasn't met over and over again I was extremely fast rated. For whatever reason, she took her anger out on me and became vindictive using her medicine license as a way to hurt me or "pay for the for the email I wrote". This is supposed to be the doctor that I trust with my health and ultimately my life and she wouldn't even speak to me for 5 minutes out of professional courtesy. I understand that I need to get a doctor in New York, but I spent half of my time in Vegas and wanted to keep my primary care physician that I feel comfortable with. Long story short, I highly recommend the practice with Dr Kim but I would never recommend or refer anyone to Dr. Vasso. Otherwise the staff is very kind and professional as well.
1 I've been here a few times with different members of my family, the wait time is good, the staff are friendly, but when receiving my last bill I was charged for 2 services ($30 and $10 icepacks) that I never received (didn't want and didn't need them, but they were never offered either).  I called the billing department and they removed the charges, but when I asked if it was standard practice to bill for services not provided they said that no, but the services that I was billed for was standard procedure for the injury that I came in for.... Seems like they are trying to get more money from the insurance companies because if my bill would have gone straight to insurance then they would have paid it because it was standard procedure....  This makes all of our insurance rates higher... Won't be coming back here....
5 I am very pleased with my decision on coming to see Dr. Reed. He is very polite, professional, and knowledgeable. Same goes to his staff. Do not hesitate to make an appointment!
5 THE ABSOLUTE BEST IN CARE!!! I LOOOOVE THIS DOCTOR!!!  She deserves a thousand stars!!!!!!!  She is so sweet, caring, kind & gentle!!!  I am SO blessed and lucky to have found this practice.  Dr Yellen and Dr. Busker both make you feel better right when you walk through the door, without even treating you yet!  Then, she does manipulations and/or acupuncture, & she has this cool new device which just touches your ear & requires no needles!!  IT IS AMAZING HOW FAST IT WORKS!!  Plus, no needles YAY!  I thought I would need to see her for a long time, a few months prob, for my current injuries/sore muscles, but I have only been in 2 weeks & I am almost good as new!  Of the dozens of doctors I have known in my life, Dr. Ava Yellen is one of the few doctors I know who actually cares about people & their health and actively works to improve it in every way!!!  She is truly a blessing!!!!!!!
4 I found this place around the time my previous doctor's office closed and SCFP was pretty much brand new at the time.  I almost always see Dr. Mendelsohn and concur with the previous review by Tre.  Dr. Mendelsohn is very knowledgeable, and takes time to ask questions so that he can try to figure out what's wrong.  He will do whatever it takes to make things right and always makes patients feel as comfortable as possible (for being in a doctor's office anyway).  The office had some staffing issues at first as some of the front desk staff were less than friendly and unwilling to help, answer questions, or return calls.  Thankfully, these have been resolved (likely due to patient surveys).  The staff currently there are very nice and always eager to help and answer questions.  Another good thing about this place is that my eye doctor moved next door at around the same time.  Come to think of it, that may have been how I found out about SCFP.
2 I thought Amanda was great. However, my husband saw other PAs of which none offered help other than "hang in there buddy".  Don't go here if you want to see a doctor. We were only ever scheduled with PAs, without even telling us that was the case. Bleh, don't recommend.
2 The doctor is great, but the staff needs serious work. You ask one of them a question , you get an answer, then when you go in you get told something different and the only response is " Do you know who told you that" or "I am not sure why they said that".  i came in and asked about a physical and the staff stated that it is preventative and 100% covered. I met with dr for the first time discussed all my health problems and was given the sheet for bloodwork. Later i get a bill in the mail saying I owe for that visit.  I call to ask and told them I was told it was 100% covered . The woman stated that because I mentioned a health issue to the doctor they changed it to an office visit and so i had to pay. I went back and forth with them as I thought it was crazy that the dr asks how youre doing and about your medical history and I was being billed for basically answering.   I had other issues with staff losing paperwork, not returning phone calls ( to the point I had to physically go down there), etc.  The doctor is great, but the staff is a nightmare. make sure you get people's names when asking any important billing/insurance questions.
5 If you need PT don't look anywhere else. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and talk to you in layman's term when describing the process.
1 Had a 7:30 am Saturday appt for a follow up from a visit on Tuesday earlier during the week, it's now 8:08 and just paid for the co-pay?! Seeing people being called in that walked in and "signed" in after me, so asked why and was told I was "put" on the appt time of 7:30 with the rest of the patients that made appts weeks or months ago, and because it was only a day in advance didn't have my "paper work" ready yet! Huh, so calling and making an appt a day before with Dr Forte, even with her who had instructed me to do was not enough time? Very poor excuse, how do you OVER-BOOK, easy, bad staff! They don't acknowledge you when you come in and just ask if you have an appt or not as soon as entering, that's it! Making an appt is a joke, it's all first come, first serve. Wait times are truly a joke, in the waiting room, in the patient room. Left the building @ 9:20 after its all said and done! Would not recommend this office just because of the front staff!
5 I'm very picky when it comes to doctors and their staff. The new location is a nice change over the old one (which always had a strange smell). I've been coming here for a few years and I really like it. Dr Schlotterback is really nice and patient (he doesn't make me feel rushed either). He also makes me feel like he genuinely cares about my health. When he isn't available I have seen other doctors all of which were very good too. I have always had pleasant experiences with office staff (far too rare these days with doctor's offices). One of the things I like best is the extended hours. They are open until 8pm Mon-Thur which allows me to make my appts without taking time off work. Words cannot express how much I appreciate this!
3 The DR's are very nice and thorough. They do their job well, & are very friendly people you can be open with, they don't try to rush you out or get rid of you. They get 5 stars. Only reason I gave 3 stars is because the receptionists/girls answering the phones are rude & don't have any phone mannerism. I explained to the girl on the phone that I felt terrible & had terrible pain in my abdomen, explained a good 5 min story about how the hospital screwed me over & misdiagnosed me... I get back in response ".....ok, so I have tomorrow available". Not friendly at all, couldn't care less about me. I always dread having to call & speak with them, I haven't had a time where I called & had a good/refreshing experience. Other than that, if it weren't for that part, the DR's are awesome & same with their MA's! If you can get passed the phone calls, the Doctors are very lovely & Caring.
5 I discovered this place through Yelp reviews. In the past yelp ratings have strayed me to something that wasn't as good as the reviews were so I was a bit skeptical. However i am more than thrilled to have discovered this place.   I have only been there once so far, my masseur was Chuan, He was wonderful. Knew exactly what i was referring to where i needed pain relief and i didn't have to explain in detail either. He got it right instantly.   I highly  recommend this place
4 Fantastic enthusiastic staff! These guys have cracked it! Welcomed into the reception and they addressed me by name after the second visit:) They are thorough and really work problem areas. I am so impressed with the progress that has been made! Try them you won't be disappointed!
1 I had the worse experience with this doctor today!!!!! Friday night on August 26 I slipped and fell on the floor. I went right the way to urgent care for a diagnostic. After an X ray the PA doctor told me that two bones from the wrist are broken and I need to see a specialist. Saturday and Sunday the offices were close. I look up on the internet and I found this Dr. GARY, who had very good reviews,  therefore today August 28, early in the morning I called the office and I made an appointment. I had such a horrible pain,,,,and when I got to the office, the girl from front desk asked if I have the x ray with me. I told her that I have only the CD. She took ,the CD went back to the Dr. And after few minutes she came back and she said that, the Dr can only put a cast on my hand but the chance for recovery it s only 50%, and he recomend for me to go to Emergency room and to not tell them I went to see a specialist, only to say that I have a very bad pain and they should take me in and probably there will be a specialist who can resolve my problem. I was shocked, fist I was thinking Dr Gary is not a surgeon. He knew I broken my arm since Friday and have a lot of pain, he did not even come to talk with me, I still thinking why he refuse to see me and also to offer me a surgery if needed, at least to explain me why he said to go to the Hospital while he is a surgeon. Unbelievable, these days the Dr s care only about money? Still , I refuse to believe that. Very disappointed..
4 I recently had foot surgery and have been going to physical therapy at this location for a couple of weeks now.  The staff is friendly and courteous.  Parking is an issue - I mean, you are rehabbing some body part and shouldn't have to walk far to get inside.  There is also a "no waiting policy," so they guarantee that you will be seen by your appointment time.  I have found all of the assistants to be very helpful and nice, although they can be a little unprofessional at times.  I don't need to hear your personal coversations, nor do the rest of the patients.  They seem to be pretty busy and each assistant will have a few patients at a time, so you don't really get personalized care.
5 This rehab center is outstanding.  My son, who plays football, got a fracture in his upper thigh area, which was quite painful.  The doctor recommended rehab to help the healing process.  The therapist at Rehab Plus worked within the doctor's request.  They were very hands on keeping him active and moving. Some days he came out sore but he felt good about his progress.  When his time of therapy was over he was back to football.   This team is world class;  today his therapist called me to see how he was doing.  It wasn't a general call,  it was a call that showed he had thorough notes and knowledge of my son's injury.  It's a rare instance when a medical practitioner checks on you as a follow-up.  Also, the receptionist is great, very personable and friendly.  I appreciate all they did.
1 The first few times I went there i would've given them 4 stars. .. but after that it just went down hill.  Even with an appointment u are still waiting at least 30 min to an hour before the doctor sees u. So what's the point of an appointment then?   Then the doctor you've been seeing is no longer with them anymore.  So u get stuck with a new doctor that judges u for getting a prescription that u need and judges u because some ppl in Vegas work weird hours like I do. So what's the issue if i work late and get off at 2 in the morning? Does that make me a drug addict?  No it doesn't. But it makes for one really awkard doctors  appointment.   And this was the final straw.  Call them to get results for blood work and get put on hold for 10 minutes only for them to tell me to ball back the next day.  I call again and they put me on hold AGAIN for 15 minutes only for them to tell me that they have to call me back because they can't access the file room. Seriously?  What are they doing that the file room is bz? I don't get it.  And then to call them for the next 2 days to be given the run around again. No answers to my blood results but more excuses as to why they cannot access the file room.  Then the kicker? They called me 3 weeks after they were supposed to call 5 times on 5 different days even after I explained to them nicely the first 2 times that I already received my results. Get your stuff together staff! No need to continuously bother your customers for no reason!!  Won't be back. And if i were u, I wouldn't either.
5 The staff where very nice and helpful. Dave the technician was extremely nice and made me feel comfortable and relaxed when I was struggling with my lungs.   02/20/2017 Returned for an ultrasound and Kristan Hunt was awesome with my ultrasound and made me feel very much at ease. All the staff where very professional and very nice.
1 I went for a massage here and it was the most inappropriate massage I've ever had. I feel the need to warn women not to go here, I was actually afraid. I kept panicking, realizing that I was in a very vulnerable position: naked, laying face down on a massage table alone with this man in an empty office that was locked
5 Dan Miriovsky is amazing.  I have seen him for 3 different injuries.  He is one of the best physical therapists I have ever met.  Highly recommended.
5 Great bed side manner and listening skills.  I just needed a doctor for my medication refills.  One is a controlled substance, so I can't get refills, I have to come in monthly.  I understand though, as some people ruin it for the rest of us.
5 What a Excellent Clinic!  Dr. Lindsay Kostal and her staff are what we at The Natural Pet Enrichment Center have been looking for.  A knowledgeable, Caring Vet that listens to her clients, discusses options, and is open to a holistic view of veterinary medicine.  We have been referring our customers to her ever since I met her to take care of Bing's issues with Arthritis.  So glad that she now offers Laser Therapy.  Please give them a call, you will be happy you did!!!!!
1 Worst office staff ever. They lost are paperwork twice.then the office manager flat out lied about loosing are paperwork . Now they want us to pay $240 for the office visits and when the insurance company pay them they will pay us back. Something just doesn't sound right about this place.
3 We have been done a lot of research on doctors in the Scottsdale,  Phoenix,  & Chandler area since we moved  from Dallas TX.  We are very pleased with this place!!! Awesome staff!!awesome medical assistants, awesome front desk!! and close to awesome hospital . Class A services and very diverse group of people ... our visit was on Jan 18 , 2016...... But their billing system is or something is wrong. My experience was I paid a co-pay andthwy said I did not have to pay but I paid anyway.....to go a bill 2weeks later saying I am late on a copay and went to collections. I paid it...  either confuse me with my son or another Tony Brown but there are SSN to verify who you are dealing with...
1 Don't waste your time here.  I had an appointment and showed up on time.  Filled out the necessary forms.  I waited half an hour.  I could hear the doctor talk loudly on the phone through his door.  Just go to your family doctor or walk-in clinic.  I had to leave because I was on my lunch break.
5 I've been very pleased with the caring and professional staff that have helped me recover from knee surgery.  Patients are treated with dignity and respect. The staff takes a personal as well as clinical interest in the patient's recovery and progress. They take the time to explain and demonstrate the exercises and are quick to correct any improper form. Highly recommend.
5 I started treatments with Dr. LaTourette after injured in a car accident. After a very thorough analysis and subsequent diagnosis, I have fully recovered and regained the quality of life I once enjoyed.   I highly recommend Dr. LaTourette as an orthopedic surgeon.
5 First time with Dr. Ariana Rabinovicz, she is now my primary. She was very welcoming, knowledgeable, made me feel comfortable and recommend a ob doctor that I already have appointment with.
5 Love this place, every Dr I have seen has been so nice and friendly, my favorite Dr there works Saturdays and she is just so friendly and comforting! Will continue to be seen by her
1 This place is horrible. If you can get your healthcare somewhere else do! They are NOT family friendly at all. The wait times are an hour or more. Their turnover in physicians is high which makes it extremely hard to get even mid-line care. Of course there was only one professional decent front desk clerk which is atleast more then I can say for other offices I guess, otherwise the front desk staff is bitchy and rude... Typical for Vegas medical care. It's just really sad that the healthcare system is so horrible and there's really nothing that can be done about it.  The physician assistant was good. He listened and explained well.
5 As a long-time Elements customer, I found myself appreciating them again after returning from a vacation where I spent almost triple than what I pay at Elements only to have a so-so massage at a resort.  The value and professionalism at Elements distinguishes them from other choices in the area.  The therapists at Elements are very experienced and seem to genuinely care about providing a great service.  Because they've become so popular, sometimes it's hard to get a last minute appointment....but good for them...they've earned their success!
5 Dr. Coy is a great physician. He is kind, caring, and collaborative. He takes time to listen to your concerns. He makes referrals when needed and is thorough in his examination.   My spouse and I both see Dr. Coy and have very different expectations and needs in a doctor. I prefer a natural approach and I'm very proactive in my care; my spouse is more ambivalent and less health conscious.  I really hate going to the doctor in general, that said, I feel comfortable with Dr. Coy and trust his judgement.  He is willing to consider non-medication related options but will also prescribe medications when needed. Dr. Coy respects my values and practices ethical medicine.  Please note that this review is specific to Dr. Coy and not Healthcare Partners, the organization that employs him. I have frustrations with the staff there, but they do not reflect on the medical care given by Dr. Coy.   Decent medical care is hard to find in this town as it is. If you need a doctor, check out Dr. Coy.
5 Morgan and his staff are fantastic.  I have been going to physical therapy for over 2 months here 3 days a week. Jose is very friendly and encouraging.  We love this place so much that my hubby decided to finally have them see him to help with his back and boxer knuck problem and is seen by Tiffany .  Im not sure what insurace's they take but we have Atena PPO that doesn't require any kind of referal.
2 I have been here a couple of times. The massage was run of the mill. The therapist didn't really ask me many questions about my problem areas, and then despite me requesting arms, he did not massage my triceps or deltoids (?!). Also, he rushed into the clinic 10 minutes late. He gave me my full time, though. No self-care prescribed. A BIG turn off for me was the POS machine prompting for a tip. Really?? This is a multi disciplinary clinic, and you're *requesting* tips?  This seems highly unprofessional for regulated health care professionals.
5 I visit Scottsdale a few times a year and have been looking for a great place for massage - I have found it! The environment is professional, clean and calming and my therapist, Warren, was fabulous. I have chronic back issues and he did a wonderful job - he listened to my issues and massaged accordingly...ahhh...I also made appointments for my daughter and husband, and when scheduling, the receptionist asked thorough questions to ensure that we would all be matched up with the right therapist. I will be back during this visit to Scottsdale and in the future!
4 My son and I are patients of Dr. Ashlee Robinson and are very pleased with the staff and Dr. Robinson. Very friendly and professional.
5 This is a large practice with several doctors.  I called around to many offices but wait times at other places werae several days.  Here I was sble to get an appointment for the next day, which was great.  I saw Dr. Alfreda, who is really nice and personable. He spent quite some time with me and was very thorough.  I am really happy that I found this practice!
1 I went to Hatfield Family Medicine for many years and I had a consistently horrible experience.  I kept trying to hang in there, but it was just ridiculous in the end.  1)  They have no concern for patient's time.  Average wait is 45 minutes (WITH an appt!), no apology.  It's standard practice there, especially the Gilbert office.  The Chandler office averaged about 20 minutes.  I lost months of my life waiting in these offices.  2)  That said, they are VERY inflexible with the patients...being 5-10 min late or having an emergency reschedule is not allowed without threat of fines or getting kicked out.    3) The office staff at the morgue is more friendly and helpful than this one.    4) I found the Dr's to be brusque and NOT engaged with patients.  I never left after seeing a Dr. there feeling a sense of concern for me as an individual.  They even seemed rather arrogant for the most part.  5) The only helpful medical staff were the 2 PA's. They both left and with them, the last of the decent medical care.    There is too much quality care out there to put up with this practice...I finally left and wish I had done it sooner!
5 I have had chronic lower back pain for some time and Dr. Landers and his staff have been terrific in treating and managing my condition, delivering life changing results.  They also happen to be wonderful people that you can trust and enjoy as a patient.  You will not find better chiropractic care.
5 Another perfect massage from Celesst this afternoon!  Always a serene experience. Staff is more than accommodating.
5 She is very good family doctor. If wasn't her we never knew we had lots of small things in our body to take care of . Even if you are not sick she will ask you to do the important things. you must do it to take care of yourself, and will tell you what your insurance company will cover or not. Other doctors doesn't care about what kind of insurance you have all they do just send you billlls that happened with me once. I'm very thankful to her hope you like her too.
5 Jennifer is absolutely amazing. She is a sweetheart. She always goes out of her way to make sure she has everything taken care of for you. She is also very well at prescribing the RIGHT medication for you and not just grabbing her pad and med-ding you up!  I've gone here for almost a year. The front desk lady, Nancy is a complete sweetheart  as well. Always leaving me the cutest voicemails if I don't answer. Great positive vibe here. Everything is run smoothly.
5 This place is wonderful! Just had my physical with Dr. Nikki..she is sweet and caring..great family physician..and LGBT friendly, if that is a concern of yours. I will recommend everyone nearby to go to her! I scheduled my appointment over the phone with Margarita right before they closed on 9/21 for 8am on 9/22..but they also take walk ins! As a new patient, I was in and out in an hour...and the main time consumer was the paperwork (as i was doing so someone else, a previous patient, even walked in without an appointment and was seen before me, and it didn't seem to affect my wait whatsoever.) Also, there was a waiver included in the paperwork agreeing that you aren't coming for narcotics. I love that they are not supporting the use of opiate pain medication. Keep that junk out of your body and off the streets!  Sidenote, they only do bloodwork on Monday Wednesday and Friday. I was aware of this when I made my appointment, just thought it might be a helpful tidbit for others with more time sensitive needs.  Needless to say, I have found my new physician.
5 If you want to heal injuries New or Old this is the place to go. They useART and other techniques to heal areas with a lot of scar tissue.Ay,Miles, Dr. Oku, hats off to you guys. You really want to heal people. If you want to put down the narcotics and get better this is the place for you. So many benefits from this treatment. It's something you can truly feel after only one treatment. Elite professional athletes flock here. This is the place to come as an alternative to operations. Those of you who have those old shoulder injuries are old car wreck injuries that never seem to heal, this place can take that pain away. Old injuries or new injuries. Thanks guys.
5 Mother has been in this facility twice now and has been treated like a queen. They never let her slack. She's there to work. Her job is to get well and regain her independence. My heart was breaking for her at first when I saw how hard they pushed her. But, boy did it ever pay off in the end! CA really knows their stuff!
4 I am a massage addict and Zen Massage is typically the only place I now go to when I need my knots kneaded. You just CANNOT beat their price for the hour-long Swedish: $45.95. You also can't miss the two orange houses that make up Zen Massage on East Blvd! Their staff is extremely friendly and even though the facilities aren't state-of-the-art, the job certainly gets done here. If you get knots around your shoulder blade area like I do, then I would highly suggest paying a bit more for the deep tissue massage. (Usually just the Swedish won't cut it for me.)   Zen also sells gift certificates which are perfect for giving to loved ones for birthdays or special occasions. Parking may be a bit confusing so check the parking lot directly behind the houses first. If that lot is full, you can park in an extra parking lot to the right of Zen. Also, if you are a newbie be sure to arrive at least 15 minutes early to fill out paperwork and get the low-down.   I've never had an issue while scheduling a massage at Zen and I've even received a massage as a walk-in here! I'm already contemplating when I'm going to get my next...
5 Dr. Venugopal is the best.  Responsive, thorough, caring and always follows up.  The staff is friendly, caring and helpful.
5 My wife recently had some pain in her lower back and called American Chiropractic Center.  The staff was friendly, fast and took care of her problem.  Excellent chiropractor!
4 I've been to several different physical therapy factories on town and thus one is not much different. Ido like the therapists and the facility is clean and well managed.  If there was one thing I could say that would give a fifth star, it would be to accept less clients. I don't know if its a scheduling deal or just too many people but a little more one on one time would separate this therapy factory from all the others.
5 Wir hatten Gutschein für Saunabesuch bei Groupon gekauft und nicht geschafft in einem halben Jahr Zeit für die Sauna zu finden. Kein Problem  Gutschein wurde von einer freundlichen Mitarbeiterin verlängert. Heute waren wir da und sind absolut begeistert: super schönes Ambiente mit Kamin und vielen Liegen, innen und Außenbereich, alles sauber. Eine gemütliche, fast schon familiäre Atmosphäre. Der Mann an der Theke (Heiko) war richtig angagiert. Was will amn mehr? Wir kommen auf jeden Fall wieder.
4 Great new addition to Yonge and Eglinton...the office is modern and clean. Front desk was very polite. The doc I saw was kind and thorough and didn't rush me. Overall very efficient and I will definately be going back.  Also they do online booking which is a plus and shows how progressive they are.
5 Our son's PT referred us to Pongratz.  At 9 month olds our son was fitted for a TLSO by Trieu.  Trieu was as sweet as can be.  He was gentle, kind, and very caring.  He made my son and myself feel right at ease.  The whole process took around 30 minutes and Trieu was very knowledgeable. The TLSO was not covered by our insurance and was about $500 out of pocket.  Pongratz worked with us so that we could have the vest right away and make payments that suited our financial needs. We are so thankful for our son's TLSO and Pongratz.  Our son has made so many gains just from the short time he has had his vest.  Thank you!
5 Dr. Powell is a wonderful and caring person; it's so hard to find a good doctor like him. He takes the time to listen to all my concerns, both big and small, making great suggestions and diagnoses that really put my mind at ease. He is really easy to talk to, and very authentic so it's surprising to me that someone on here would say otherwise.       As for the rest of the staff, they are all very kind as well and I can always get in for an appointment quickly; the wait to see the doctor for your appointment is really short too. I also appreciate how clean the waiting room and offices are too. I don't generally write a lot of reviews, but I feel as if this clinic deserves more recognition because of how great their services are.
1 I'm new to LV, was looking for a doctor and was referred to this place by someone who had been a previous patient. Little did they know the staff is so incompetent that the girl who answers the phone can't even do that correctly.  So I called to make my first appointment and Angela answered the phone (sounding like she was too tired to be at work or too lazy to talk) and quickly placed me on hold. I held for about 20mins, then hung up. I figured maybe they had gotten busy and forgot as doctors offices often can. During the second call, the same person answered, and yet again, I was placed on hold for another 20mins. Proper business etiquette would dictate that the person answering the phone at least come back and notify the person holding what the situation is, ask them to continue to hold and thank them for holding.  Instead of calling back, I called another family doctor and was treated with courtesy and respect as a new paying patient should be. I would NEVER recommend this place and if I could give zero stars or negative I would.  After reading other reviews here I am not sure how they are even still practicing!!!   NEVER GO TO THIS PLACE AND THAT ANGELA GIRL NEEDS TO BE FIRED!!! She will cost them business, new and old!
5 For at least 2 years, my mother was a patient here. The beautiful facilities, pleasantly warm pool temperature, and the guidance of several encouraging physical therapists gave my mother, a lifelong swimmer, a chance to enjoy a softened variation of her former workout.  For her, this also became a comforting place to regularly relate to others with similar orthopedic issues. Comparing progress notes with fellow therapy patients and learning about their journeys was as valuable to my mother as the actual physical therapy. She was able to experience the joy of water exercise in a safe, well-planned environment. The open pool hours were very accommodating, the monthly fee reasonable, and the safe, well-managed facility were very attractive features of the post-physical therapy experience that is offered. Though I am an athletic swimmer and not as much in need of physical therapy, I plan to maintain a monthly membership at Peter B. Lewis to ease my arthritic challenges. I am open to the possibility that I would engage in both the dry land and aquatic physical therapies that are offered here.
5 I have not personally been a patient at SW Spine and Sports but my wife has.  I have gone to every single one of her appointments with her and the staff and providers have always been very helpful and friendly.  Dr. Stone and Dr. Komar have taken really good care of my wife, the office is clean and easy to get to from the 101, and the back office staff have always been friendly.  I would definitely recommend SW Spine and Sports.
5 The staff is wonderful! The physical therapists are extremely knowledgeable and very easy to talk to. Everyone there makes each visit warm, inviting, and fun. I would truly recommend this environment to anyone that has to go through physical therapy.
1 I wish there is an option for no star because that would be my true rating. Their staffs were so unprofessional. Not comfirmed with my insurance card and they ended up billing to the wrong insurance I had before. When I have question for my bill, they just simply hang up on me. So rude! NEVER GO BACK THERE AGAIN!!! NO BODY DESERVE SUCH a BAD SERVICE!
5 Excellent staff! I have gone though physical therapy here twice now, as they were recommended to me by my orthopedic doctor. Very pleased both times!
5 Dr. Trinka and Dr. Kristen are phenomenal chiropractors and are extremely attentive, knowledgeable and friendly.  Sara, the office manager, is incredibly attentive as well and such a pleasure to see.  All of the assistants, front desk workers and massage therapists are knowledgeable, friendly, helpful and kind!  I love visiting Goodyear Chiropractic!
5 The staff here really cares and values you as a patient.  I am able to work with my doctor to manage my health and I never feel like they are talking at me.   They have late hours, Saturday hours and walk-ins (so I don't have to go to urgent care).  They do all their blood work on site, there is an attached wellness clinic with dietician and diabetes meetings.   I have been going here for years, and I now know they value of a good doctor and their team.   On several occasions I have referred my doctor to someone else and they too love this place, so will you.
1 I just want to give a BIG FAT ZERO! Horrible service! Even with an appointment it takes over an hour waiting outside then wait more when you get in! Ridiculous!! Called once to see how busy the clinic is, asked the person on the phone questions like, how long it usually take for a walk-in? Are you guys busy? All she said was I DON'T KNOW! I'M IN THE BACK, I ONLY ANSWER THE PHONE! Then when I got there, another walk-in came after me, but she went in BEFORE me! How do I know she's a walk-in? Because I was sitting right next to the window!! Even worse, I tried to get my referral in, called them like everyday. This woman from the referral department, Valerie, never calls me back. I left her messages everyday, the people in the front took messages. After over a week, she finally called back but she gave me the wrong information! Even now two weeks later, I can't even schedule my ultrasounds!! Also with the doctors, every time I go in, I get a different doctor. I don't mind as long as they are helping me. But every time I get a new doctor they'll tell me something different something new! They are reading the same freaking medical records! I feel like I can't even trust the doctors there, they don't give a crab about you! They just want you to keep coming back to pay them! This is the most horrible doctor place I've ever been!!!
5 Awesome amazing love this place!  The owner is amazing and the sweetest person ever!  Thank you Julie!
5 Thank you Lc C. I'm not sure who you are, but you made my day with your post. I love and appreciate all of our patients as I know Dr. Nnadi does as well.
3 I broke my arm snowboarding, which sucks, but in a way I was actually pretty lucky. I did not have to wear a cast, but I did have to keep my arm in a sling for about 8 weeks. In that time, I developed what is referred to as an encapsulated shoulder, which I had to go have physical therapy for. Desert Valley Therapy was where my doctor sent me.  Right off the bat I wasn't thrilled with the office, it was hard to find a parking place and the people that worked at the front desk really could have been more helpful and friendly. The therapist I was assigned to was great though, he was so helpful to me with regard to exercises I could do at home and in the pool to increase my mobility. And the assistants were very kind as well.   Within about a month time, I realized that I was getting more out of the exercises I was doing on my own than I was out of my sessions at Desert Valley. I still continued to go multiple times a week, and asked the therapist and his assistants to give me more to do so I could heal quicker. I feel like if I had not asked for more advanced exercises, they would have been a-ok with me healing slowly.    Ultimately I stopped going to Desert Valley even though I was not officially done with treatment due to a staffing issue. I arrived to a scheduled appointment only to learn that the therapist I had been seeing was moved to another location. It would have been nice to be warned about this before arriving, it also would have been nice to have been given the opportunity to continue to see the same therapist at the location he had moved to.   Desert Valley Therapy did what needed to be done to ensure I'd regain full mobility after my arm injury. I'm not sure I'd recommend them to anyone that has a choice of which physical therapists to see though.
4 I recently finished using my 30 day unlimited pass. The Tempe location is the last of the 3 Bikram locations I've tried since January.  You do get the most bang for your buck by sticking with one location and taking advantage of the 20% off a class package.  It really is a state-of-the-art studio. The the studio itself has none of the sweaty "smell" mentioned in the other reviews. The anti-microbial "carpet" is my favorite flooring of all the Bikram locations I've been to. The corner farthest from the lobby door really IS the HOT side of the room but there are several fans so you can set your mat up near one to catch a hot breeze. Check out their website for lots of useful info about yoga etiquette & how to be ready for your first Bikram class. The shower/sink area is TINY for the number of people using the dressing room.   This location is celebrating their 10 year anniversary & is always BUSY!! Each class typically 40+ students in it & I think they MAX out around 50. Yes 50!! So the size of the class itself can be a bit intimidating if you're new to Bikram. The routine seems to be get there as early as you can, go lay out your mat in the spot of your choice & then sit in the lobby until 2 min before class.  I've tried to change it up & try class with at least 10 different teachers. While the dialogue is basically the same, each one has their own energy & style. You can check the schedule online if you want to choose your class specific to the instructor. And several of the instructors actually do teach at more than one location. I really enjoyed classes with Charles, Ben & Jeremy.  All of them reminded us about the importance of BREATHING! My favorites phrase from Charles is so simple: " I am inhaling. I am exhaling." It really helped me focus on controlling my breathing :)   One instructor actually finished about 8 minutes early and I did feel rushed! I was hoping it was just a fluke but the 2nd time I took her class the same thing happened.  There were 4 or 5 first-time Bikram students in the class and not once did she remind us about a 5 second in / 5 second out breath. Nor did she talk about how they might be feeling or say it was ok to take a knee or lie down if needed.  If she offered up a little more guidance we would probably finish at 90 minutes. I hate to say it but I probably won't be taking her class again.
1 Run run run away as fast you can.  Unprofessional Dr's and staff.  I showed up for a 12:00 appointment, after waiting 30 minutes I was told the Dr leaves at 1:00 and was too far behind schedule.  Wanted me to come back in 2 weeks, still trying to get my co-pay back.  What a JOKE!!! Small claims court here we come.
2 My issue with this location wasn't the wait, but the staff. They were snapping at each other, complaining about patients, and all within earshot of the waiting room.  They were talking about this one couple who walked in 1 MINUTE after they were closed like they weren't even there. I was shocked. I mean I can understand they were probably irritated because it was the end of the night, but don't argue with each other and talk about guests while they are right there. Wait until you get home or something.  Also the nurse that I had wasn't that personable and was very rough when treating me, despite the fact that I had told the doctor that I was already in a lot pain.  I think next time, I'll just wait it out at home or drive to another location.
5 Who does this? My husband was holed up in bed with a serious ear infection and Christine S agreed to meet him at the office on a Sunday night at 5:30p for a full exam. She diagnosed and treated him aggressively AND with TLC. This kind of care is almost unheard of anymore. THANK YOU Anthem Total Health for superb patient care.
5 Fast, friendly service. Easy to make an appointment, staff was very kind. Facility was super clean, smelled great. Doctor was very kind and informative. Will definitely keep returning!
5 Why does this place have such bad reviews?  I've been going here since I was kid. Sure it has it's problems--which I will get to in a second--but this has been my favorite doctor. I've tried numerous others, but have always found myself returning to this site. The main perks is that this is the only doctor that I have been to that will see you the same day. That's crucial when you're really sick, and for me I use it a lot with my children.  Yes, some of the complaints other Yelpers have posted have their merits. You do have to wait in line even with an appointment. And there is shameless marketing in some of the offices with the head doctor's--Dr. Celaya--son race gear stuff. But for me, they're all small little inconveniences (the shameless marketing I found just plain out funny).  These doctors were with me when I was fairly sick in 2007, and they were there for my mom when before she had to head into surgery. For all their small faults, they're there when it matters most.
5 Mary is a fantastic deep tissue massage therapist.  She knows the human anatomy. I had to go to Mary twice in June, because my neck, shoulders were pretty damaged by how I cradeled the phone with my shoulder, while I would type on the computer.  You know we all do that. I had to get some healing in parallel to ordering headsets for the my phones and getting ergonomic assessments done. Mary did a great job of isolating the problem, giving me deep tissue massage.  It was painful, but it did the trick and I am 100% better and have learned stretch techniques from her to continue with the healing process.  I'll never cradel the phone again!
1 RUDE staff! Couldn't even make an appointment! The gal that answered the phone refused to let me make an appointment for my boyfriend because we aren't married. Why should it matter if were contractually bound to each other, I'm just trying to make an appointment.  We clearly do not want anything to do with a doctors office that has people like that representing them. Next!
5 No joke here. This is the best place to have your dental work done. It does no matter what it is, root canal, cavity, cleaning and other dental needs. Its a Dental School. The students are all great, supervised and in the process of becoming dentist. I've had two pairs (they work in twos) and all the work has been great In the instance that a more experienced dentist was needed I was worked on by them.  Now for the cost. Root canals are around $150! Not bad considering my other dentists charged $800 and then the crown for another $800. At MidWestern ifs $550 for the crown.   When walk in for your appointment its quite fascinating. All appointments are at 1pm so the waiting room is packed. The students come down to pick up their patients. Its fascinating to watch this process. Everyone is very happy to see each other. I would recommend them to anyone!! Especially if you are on a budget.
1 I just want to write this review regarding Dr. Fortes office. My family and I have tried to see her and her other PA doctors thinking maybe she just had a bad attitude but I just want to point out that besides Forte every single person that is on her staff have no respect, manners, or even common courtesy. They do not seem to have any concern or care for any of their patients. They never returned any of my phone calls after I had been to their office with a very very severe infection, anyways the problem is the antibiotics they prescribed has a deadly reaction to my medication that I HAVE to be on. When I called to have it fixed (including the pharmacist calling) no body bothered to call me back or the pharmacist  back At All!!!! If my pharmacist would not have caught this issue I could be dead!! It would have been no one else's fault but every staff member at Fortes office!!! I am beyond disappointed at the level of professionalism that was showed and the lack of concern for your patients. This office deserves NO stars!!!!!!!    I just want to say AMEN!!!! I refuse to see anyone at that office anymore because every single person there and especially the front desk people are very very rude!
1 Pros: Very nice doctors.   Cons: crowded always. Doctor spends short amount of time with you. Anywhere you go you know you'll have to wait but these guys are ridiculous. Good luck trying to schedule an appointment without the help of a crystal ball. At least 3 weeks + average to schedule an appointment.   I've called multiple times to schedule an appointment and the phone rings and rings and the hangs up. After you dial, the menu order is 1, 1, 0 to speak to an "operator" who schedules appointments.
5 Ron rocks! I visited Maximum Velocity proactively because I hadn't trained as much as I should have for an upcoming half-marathon. He gave me some running form tips to help minimize soreness and make me a more efficient runner. I made it through the races just fine! I'm continuing to visit so Ron can help me with strength training exercises to be a better runner. So far so great!
1 I contemplated changing primary care physicians a year ago after having a lot of difficulty getting through to office staff to follow up on my lab work and for prescription refills, but I decided to let it slide. Well, this week I went to see the NP at Dr. Ana Sierra de Aragon's office, and while he was friendly, he wrote my prescription for the wrong quantity so my pharmacy would not fill it. My pharmacy reported that they called 3 times with no response. I called the office twice today to have them correct it and I didn't get a call back, not even to acknowledge they were working on it. I also learned this week that the labwork I had done back in April/May of 2014 showed my Vitamin D was deficient, yet NO ONE discussed that with me until nearly 1 yr later! I am looking for a new doctor. The office staff seems unprofessional and uncaring. I should have changed doctors last year.
1 Impossible to ever see a doctor, or get a nurse, Linda, to respond with prescriptions to pharmacy. Never see PA Cherl, she "can't evaluate that during today's visit but you are welcome to schedule another appointment.   The office was once great, but don't waste your time here if you really want good care.  I knew there was a problem for years but I am finally going to get a new doctor. I give up on this place.
5 Amazing peaceful place that helps you detox and reenergize yourself! The staff is just as great and I will continue to enjoy these wraps forever !
1 After months of dispute with this place. I am still very angry and bitter. I spent thousands of dollars at Dr Mikes office for only temporary relief, my HIPPA rights were violated multiple times, and I dealt with someone who is such an unethical snake it makes my blood boil.   Vicki: you may report my review for personal attacks all you want... Doesn't hide the truth. The bookkeeper at this company TRIED to rip me off (I have emails and print out og treatments and then sent to me to collections without telling me.) I called to ask her about it which she refused to talk to me about it. After days of calling and screaming and threatening to file fraud, they finally dropped my case.  Dr Mike is great however get print out and receipts of EVERYTHING you get done there.
1 I gave this place 2 years of a chance, meaning, 2 check-up chances--and in between, when one of us got sick, we had to come in for a check-up and a doctor's note. When this happened, my wife got someone else's prescription! So we called the office and told them that this was a HIPAA violation, and they said "yes, exactly--so you have to drive back here and return that so we can write you a new one" --I told them, why would I be inconvenienced for this incident and demand that I drive back when I already do not feel well?! So, basically I never really returned. I dread the days that I have to call them, because it takes forever to get an answer, and when they do, they put you on hold. Even if you have an appointment with them, they make you wait for 45 minutes at the least. I have been to many doctor practices and office, but this is by far the worst. If you go back in, because they say that you need to get your test results, you will have to wait AGAIN. After 2 years, my only regret is not realizing that I should've sought for someone else's practice for my yearly check-ups. I finally found a new one, faster service, more professional and personable--- if you don't have to pick this place, I highly recommend find another one. You will be wasting your time hanging out in their waiting room, only to wait some more in the appointment room. Crazy!
5 What an amazing and friendly place! Dr. Steve is very friendly and down to earth. He is very good with children. My son suffers from chronic back and bone pain due to spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia so I was a little worried about taking him in, but Dr. Steve knows his stuff. My son walked out of there with next to no back pain! Already made our next appointments and would definitely recommend Global Chiropractic to anyone. Very friendly and helpful staff. Oh yeah, I suffer from migraines and have for many years, but since I have been adjusted I haven't had one! Thank you so much Dr. Steve and staff!
5 Just tried today and really happy with the service and staff. Definitely like to go there again. Appointments are easy and very friendly atmosphere and you feel welcome !!!
5 In Arizona it is very hard to find a naturopath, Dr. Grobe was great! She sat down and talked to me for about 20 minutes and did not make me feel rushed at all during my appointment. I did have a short wait to go back during my appointment time, but it wasn't too bad. The tea they sell and the tinctures are also reasonably priced which I love!
1 TERRIBLE customer service!!!! Can't understand anything they are saying on the phone. Refused service because the phone operator didn't want to do his job by calling my dr. to confirm a lab request... Didn't know how to properly read lab request form, then why are you working at a dr. Office if you don't know what your doing!! Was Hung up on twice when I asked to speak to a manager!!!!! SHIT service gets a shit review.
2 My family used this practice for years, but had to find a new doctor when the office became too difficult to work with. They refuse to manage routine mail in prescriptions as most doctors do by ordering a year's worth at a time (3months, renewable by 3). I am not talking about narcotics, I am talking about blood pressure and other routine medications. We had no problem making quarterly appointments for follow up visits, but about a week before the quarterly appointment the office would call and cancel the appointment and reschedule for about 2 weeks after we were to run out of meds. This happened 3 times in a little over a year. My husband was a nervous wreck over this practice. We also found it impossible to get same day appointments when acute illnesses happened. My daughter had strep throat symptoms and the office stated that they were too busy to see her. Strep throat can result in kidney problems, heart valve problems, and scarlet fever. We ended up going to an urgent care for the issue.  Finally, most offices will do your annual physical, send you to the lab for the required lab tests and phone you with the results. This office requires two separate doctors appointments, requiring two co-pays and additional costs for the insurance company.
5 I am a professional golfer from Canada who trains in Charlotte North Carolina. As a professional athlete getting back quickly when I have injuries and injury prevention are my two highest priorities. Dr. Greenapple and his staff are world class. It is the best treatment that you can get anywhere. I have worked with all three chiro's in the clinic and all are excellent. I would highly suggest anyone with injury issues or just trying to stay healthy to go check it out. You will not regret it!!
1 So on my first and last visit ever to the Gold Canyon location. I witnessed true unprofessionalism by PA Steven King. All was going well, setting me up for routine tests and all. While I was checking out, Mr King was sitting at his computer browsing a news site and made a comment loud enough for all standing 15 ft away, his distaste for our current president (said he agreed with I. S. I. S.) and another male patient chimed in and said Trump was an Idiot. In this political climate that is not wise and I became upset and said what I thought back at them, tore up my lab requests & stormed out. NEVER WILL GO BACK.  Simple business etiquette, don't talk politics or religion if you are amongst clients or strangers. Any sane person knows this.
5 This place is incredible!  I have been going at least 3 times a week for a year now, and it is my 'happy place' for sure.  EVERY SINGLE teacher is fantastic, the studio is always spotlessly clean, the hot room is big and airy instead of dark and claustrophobic like some other hot studios.  The owners and desk staff genuinely care about the practitioners.  Love this place!
5 I came here to shadow(observation) the physical therapy setting a few times and the place is really well kept and relaxing. The staff- Cheryl, Rylan, Jordan, and Jeff were all really helpful and extremely kind. They've given me an extreme measure of insight of the Physical Therapy field and I can't thank them enough for giving me this opportunity to participate. Their practices really give you an insight to  how they have a passion for helping people. I highly recommend this place!  -Omari
5 Never done this before, I'm expectant mother in the third trimester (my 40th week to be exact), so I wasn't sure what to expect. It took me a minute to get comfortable, until I realized I needed to let the water take the burden of the weight. It was great to practice my yoga breathing and give myself a soft massage. The time was enough to rest without motion as well. I left relaxed and invigorated. My legs rested. Highly recommend! Vianca and Chris were very nice and accommodating. Thank you, guys!
5 Alper is the BEST RMT I have ever had!. I cannot say enough great things about my experience at City RMT with Alper Sungur. From the beginning to the end of the treatment I was treated with outmost respect, outstanding application of most advanced techniques and genuine concern for my overall wellbeing. I have seen many RMT's through years and would hands down say that Alper is just phenomenal!. It is his knowledge that he is willing to share, effective treatment and very friendly character that made me go out of his clinic feeling like I am flying. Not only is he a great RMT he is also a 4th year osteopathy student and clearly integrates this two professions into one powerful work of art. Alper is strong and works at all those stubborn knots but also can be sensitive to your specialized needs if you just want to relax. His sincere friendly character just an icing on the cake to all of his fantastic work. He explained the causes of my wrist, shoulder and back pain in synergy and then performed his magic were I felt an instant relief from pain caused by tendinitis that has been bugging me for 2 years!. I cannot wait to go back for my next treatment and will definitely recommend him to all my friends and family!  THANK YOU once again Alper!
3 I signed up for the one month unlimited new student pass at Bikram Yoga Tempe shortly after injuring my left knee Olympic Weightlifting.    And what a steal at $29!   This was my first experience with Bikram; had a brief affair with Sumits in the past.   I'm going to try to be as fair as possible with this review.   Almost everyone I encountered was friendly! How genuine it was, erm ... Who knows.   While I enjoyed my experience, and studio and space is absolutely gorgeous, I felt some of the teachers could do significantly better about being mindful of their students' injuries.   I went to great lengths to inform the teachers prior to class of my injury, and may not get into (or even attempt) some of the poses per my orthopedic surgeon and physical therapist's instruction.   One was happy to offer modifications prior to class. AMAZING! One just acknowledged it then called me out several times to get into the poses (ones recommended to avoid) at all costs.   Militant much? I thought this was Yoga.  Of course I'm an athlete and competitive as all get out with myself and attempted these poses against  better judgement.  Not only was this severely painful (we're talking about a meniscus injury, severe osteochondrosis and a badly contused femur here) ... It almost put me off from the practice completely.   The studio seems to pack as many students as possible into their ginormous space, which makes me wonder if a teacher is able to truly spot poor form and correct it. Kind of like overbooking CrossFit classes ... A Hunger Games situation just waiting to happen.  Another thing I noticed, these guys like to brag about their heating system, yet this place doesn't get as hot as other studios. What's the point if it's cool?   Anyway, BYT closed for renovation on May 16th with 2-3 days left on my pass.  BYT was a nice intro to the practice, but I don't think I'd commit to a membership here for the reasons stated in this review.  Update 6/10: Received an e-mail response to this review from Elaina Zorensky. Very classy and much appreciated! I've attached photos to this review in the spirit of being transparent. Thanks for your response, Elaina - I'll send you one shortly.
4 This practice is basically a one-stop for pain management, providing a physician, holistic doctor, chiropractor, and physical therapists under one roof. The practice receptionist is on top of her game, having your chart ready to go before you walk into the door each session and breaking down the billing to your insurance.  I came to Gilbert physical medicine to treat scapulothoracic bursitis, hip tendonitis, and neck whiplash. Each of my sessions would consist of a combination physician consult and sarapin trigger point injection, chiropractic adjustment, and time with a tens unit. They also can take their own xrays in-house. Every provider I worked with here was incredibly caring and patient. My only hesitation with this practice concerns the stigma placed on surgical intervention by some (not all) of the providers. I was often warned of the "huge irreparable mistake" I was making by seeking surgery to correct my scapula. In my post-op I learned that the bone spur removed from my scapula was incorrigible by physical therapy and holistic matters. Had I listened to these opinions, I would never have found relief from the chronic pain that is now entirely gone. I sincerely appreciate everything the providers and staff here did to help me. I do believe, however, that surgical opinions are to be issued by surgeons.
1 Avoid this place like your told to avoid carbs, sugar and sodium. Set up an appointment for a physical at 11:20. Arrived 10 minutes early. 2 hours spent waiting and still haven't been called. This place is a joke. Never again.
5 Dr Roach is friendly and easy to talk to. My back and neck are feeling much better since he started with my adjustments.
1 Molly Ann rushed through my visit.  At one point she left the room and I sat waiting, expecting her to return. I finally stepped out of the room, asking if she was coming back in, and without turning away from her computer she said, "no that's all." Horrible service. I called to cancel an upcoming appointment to be told it had already been cancelled...WHAT?  I won't be returning.
5 Dr. Dye is a true professional.  He is always willing to spend the extra time necessary to understand your specific needs.  He is very personable and loves to help others.  When you need a chiropractor "Dr. Dye is your guy".  And the staff is awesome.  Highly recommended!
5 I have felt improvements even after 1st visit. That I T band is a evil little thing. I am happy to say looks like I won't need surgery on my posterior torn meniscus after their great work. Now I can get back to Orange Theory!
5 I highly recommend Affiliated. They treat everyone like family and are very professional at the same time. I have worked with everyone in there and I love it. I broke my hand and was very discouraged about the healing process, Shane and Jason are very knowledgeable and reassured me while explaining what would to expect during this healing process. I actually look forward to coming in twice a week.
1 If I could give this practice zero or negative stars, I would.  They scheduled my mom for an appt at a location she was used to going to without telling her that the location was closed.  We called the number provided and the customer service rep hung up on me when I asked to speak with a spvsr.  We showed up 15 minutes late at the new location and was told they couldn't see her because she was past her appt.    This was not the first episode of horrible customer service,  but it's certainly the last. Previous experience with this office includes not sending proper referrals resultin in having to re-schedule appointments with specialists, not ordering the proper medication refills and poor customer service from the front desk staff.   I will now find mom a new primary care physician.
1 Oh my gosh! Where do they FIND these people!? Very unprofessional with NO concern for the poor patient who walks through the door - it's all about the money. They want you to pay before you even SEE anyone - let alone a doctor.  Run for your life.... Literally!
5 My family has had occasion to visit several naturopathic doctors in the Valley over the past few years, and the experiences have ranged from average to horrendous.  We are very happy to have found Dr. Lioce.  Specifically, he is helping my family with bioidentical hormone treatment and various other natural methods.  Dr. Lioce is clearly passionate about what he does and gives you the impression that his decision to enter into natural medicine extends beyond simply a business venture.  He has mentioned in passing that he offers other very sophisticated treatments that we have not taken advantage of yet.     If you are looking for a kind, caring, and engaged doctor to offer a powerful and much more effective alternative to the often destructive and misguided conventions of western medicine, give Dr. Lioce a try.
5 I've been coming to Family Doctors of Green Valley since I moved to town 9 years ago. All of their doctors are top notch and take the time to understand your situation. I have a few chronic conditions, so I'm not the norm, I've got medications and diagnostics to deal with at my appointments as well.  About 10 months ago I started doing Medical Weight loss at another Doctor, and then found that their scheduling was so horrible that it would take me 2.5 hours to drive to the office, have my appointment and get back to work. That just wasn't working for me so I switched the medical weight loss over to my normal doctors office. There's a great continuity of care because I see the same PA for weight loss that I do for my Primary Care visits. So far I'm down 55lbs and I've never felt better. I even had to take a new DMV picture because my old one didn't look like me anymore!! I love that this office accommodates my schedule and they offer late appointments during the week AND weekend appointments too.
5 VPC has amazing drs and nurses.  I have been seen in their office for over 13 years.  If you have any problem with this drs office than its because you can't get what you want from them as far as  medication goes.  They are not there to prescribe drugs, they are there to help you get better.  I have since moved to Nv and these people out here are crazzzzzy.  I so miss my drs in Az.  VPC drs/nurses have great bedside manner and know how to talk to you and listen to you.  I miss you all soooo much.
3 Good docs but just be prepared to sit & wait a whole lotta time. Hopefully I'll never have to come back here again because they are not good at scheduling appointments and keeping order with appointments. My appointment was orginally scheduled at 4:30, Core called and  asked if I could see their PA instead of doctor and to come in @ 4:10 instead of 4:30.  Reluctantly I agreed to do so but I did not get to see the said PA until after 5 pm until after I had to raise a fuss because I was just sitting and waiting. After all of that I did not get the surgical appointment for which I went there for. Left work early lost wages for doing so.... waste of time and money!!!
1 I recently took my grandmother to the SW office for an appointment with a nurse practitioner as she couldn't see her primary care doctor. The nurse practitioner was very good, but her medical assistant was very rude and inefficient. The assistant called one out of three medications to the wrong pharmacy, referred my grandmother to an in-patient physical therapist instead of out patient and gave the physical therapist the POA's phone number instead of my grandmothers. All of these issues caused a lot of confusion and stress for my grandmother. Mistakes happen, but based on the assistant's attitude I can only conclude that she simply didn't care enough to ensure things were done properly.
4 I'm actually a member of YMCA but since they had free open week, I decided to give it a try (downtown location only). Here are the reasons why i think a person should subscribe to this gym:  1) You have limited time to walk to a different gym during lunch break (if your office is in PVM or Sunlife building) 2) You value group classes highly. The group classes - Insanity &Rock bottom - are much more intensive l than YMCA and very professional. The yoga class is almost as nice as Enso - located in a beautiful sunny loft with 100% glass roof, you get to stretch and tan at the same time even in winter!  3) Towels-  you can grab them anytime & anywhere, while in other gyms, i guess you can grab them only at the entrance as an additional service.  However, the downside of this place is actually not the price/month but the old school scheme- lock you in a yearly contract!If my office moves just 200 metres away from Mansfield, i will change gym because I only go during lunch hours, or if i move to a new condo that has gym&pool in it, or I prefer to do hot yoga challenge for 3 months in winter and join a different running club during summer only, i cannot pause the gym...  Both are probably not a good reason to cancel a yearly membership and fight with them legally? It's a pity, but i will stick to another gym without a yearly contract.
4 Very talented drs and staff. Dr Johnsen was an incredible surgeon. They definitely need more reception and scheduling staff as sometimes had to wait on hold for 25 minutes before a live body answered the phone.
5 This office helped me get through a back issue from a car accident.  Very professional and would highly recommend them.
1 Very unprofessional staff. When ever you call you either get transferred around which you eventually get a voicemail, hung-up on or no answer at all. No one calls you back. Last minute reschedules but claims they called the day before to cancel or reschedule the appointment. Very long waits. I understand medical offices can get extremely busy but 2 hour waits are ridiculous even ER waits aren't that long anymore. No one including the MD, PA's and LPN calls you back. Lab results aren't given in a timely manner either. It is very frustrating for patients like myself to go to medical offices when employees are rude, nothing is done in a timely matter.
4 Staff friendly and easy scheduling. Went here because I threw out my back hard. Find out my left hip was not very equal to my other. Very helpful in finding out what's wrong with certain things. I quickly recovered with their expertise and support. I recommend to come here if insurance covers. My advice if you need PT: everyday, twice a day you exercise and do stretches they have you do when you're there. You control how fast you recover.
5 This is the best experience I have ever had with a chiropractor. He takes the time to listen and address my concerns. His adjustments are gentle but so effective. He finds the problem areas, it is amazing how well he finds them, and takes care of it. I recommend him to all of my friends and my clients. He is also very friendly and explains what he is doing every step of the way. Thanks Dr. Nemanic! You rock!
4 I have been here many times for check ups and other things and I have read some of the reviews about long waits and then long waits in the patient area waiting for the doctor too. And I don't believe people are as assertive as they should be. I'm not saying be rude or bitchy, I'm saying be clear. In the 20 times or so that I've been there, I only had to wait past my appointment once. And at ten minutes past my appointment time I walked up and told them nicely that my time is just as scheduled as theirs and if we agree on an appointment time we need to stick to it. I was called in as quickly as I pointed out the delay. And only once while in the exam room did I get up to look for my doctor. I'll wait only 15 minutes before looking to be seen. When Dr G came in, I just explained to him (politely btw) that my day is based on appointments too and I always plan on leaving within two hours. I mean that's pretty patient don't you think? Two hours is plenty of time. Since then all my appointments have been wonderful. I arrive 20 minutes before my appointment and I get to the exam room by my scheduled time and Dr. G comes in within 15 minutes. He's great, he listens and always ask for samples of the prescription he's given you. It will save you $$$.  As for the staff, well I think it can also depend on your own personality, I mean I am pretty outgoing plus if I have any concerns I speak my mind....pleasantly btw. I have gotten to know them and they're pretty good people who have a job to do that requires lots of people. Sometimes "you" just need to prod them a little.  Now I referred my wife's friend to this office and she felt uneasy because they tried to "up-sale" her with products. Why did she feel uneasy? Is saying "no thank you" that stressing? For me, I feel pretty comfortable when I'm there and have no issues talking to my doctor.   I think sometimes people have blinders on and don't realize there are others to be seen too. We are all important, therefore deserve to be seen when scheduled. And if you aren't, speak up. You don't have to be rude you just have to speak up.
2 Interesting post about the staff.  I had no problem with the office staff, but when I had to deal with the medical staff, other than the Dr., they were rude, nasty, and condescending.    I take responsibility for my own health care, and when I asked for my lab results to be mailed to me, they said 'we don't do that'.  You can come in and pick them up, but 'we don't do that'.  I should spend time and gas to come pick up the results, but they can't put them in an envelope and pay the 50 cents to mail the damn thing.  I called back again and this time INSISTED they be mailed.  The medical staff again REFUSED, but someone in the office staff said she would take care of it, and 2 days later they were in my mailbox.   Perhaps the medical staff needs a house cleaning?  Or at least an exercise in manners and whom they work for!
5 A relaxing and euphoric experience! Chris and Viance were friendly and welcoming. Allure Floatspa is clean and well-equiped. They provide everything you need to have an amazing float experience.
5 Dr. Drew is wonderful!  He always has time for my questions.  The other therapies are great and he is always accommodating with my schedule.  Amy B.
5 Tyra provides a service that is effective and well needed in Las Vegas. This is a long over due greatness that Las Vegas has needed for quite some time.  Thank you Trya and Resortcierge MD!
4 Dr and staff are friendly and courteous. We have several foster children and they fetus appointments the same day or next day. Accepts Medicaid.
2 I tried to make an appointment assuming it would be weeks before I could see the doctor. I waited on hold for 10 minutes (which is typical) to be told that they were not accepting new patients that didn't already have family seeing the doctor. And if I did want to schedule as a new patient I wouldn't be able to get in for a few months. Not trying to give the doctor a bad review since I've never been there. This is just an FYI for all my yelpers
3 I purchased a groupon for the 90 min ashiatsu massage. The massage was great, but it would have been nice to have gotten the full 90 minutes.  So this is how my experience went, I called them 10 minutes before my appointment time to let them know that the parking lot was full and I could not find a spot, I asked if I could park in one of their reserved covered spots and they said I had better not as the Dr. might have me towed. So I drove around until I finally found a spot. I got inside 5 minutes after my appointment time (very busy parking lot) make sure you get there 15 or 20 minutes early so you can compensate for parking and form filling as not to have it shaved off of your appointment time.   They had me fill out paper work and put me in the room. The therapist left me in there for 5 minutes, at this point looking back I was already 15 minutes into my massage time.   I received my massage It was great and the therapist pleasant, but 5 minutes before my time was up the therapist concluded the massage.   So I have to wonder, If I were to have payed full price and not purchased it via groupon, would I still have been shorted time? Either way I find it a poor business practice to offer a massage of any length and not give the full time stated. If you only do a 70 minute or 80 minute massage let people know that is what they are actually paying for as to not be misleading.  After the massage was over and I went to drink my water in the reception room I was greeted by the receptionist who then tried to get me to give them my insurance information.  After just receiving a massage the last thing I want is to be grilled for insurance info on a massage I had already paid for. I think it more appropriate to ask if the client would like to schedule another massage and then give them the option of furnishing that kind of info either over the phone or at their next appointment.   All and all the ashiatsu massage is a fantastic modality, it is deep and gentle at the same time, I'm not sure if it is only done to the back of the body but when I was turned face up I was given a mediocre mild pressure massage for the remainder of my time.  I would get another ashiatsu massage, I'm just not sure if I would return to a chiropractic office to receive one.
5 Organized, knowledgeable, and attentive help with torn shoulder tendon. Comfortable atmosphere in small facility of this practice. Scheduling and payment are straightforward. I would return here again were additional therapy needed.
1 This is in regards to Girish H. Daulat, D.O., who works at this facility.  The only reason I gave this "doctor" one star is because I had to.  I saw this "doctor" -- actually his PA, Anthony J. Marlow, PA-C on one brief occasion.  Shortly thereafter I was laid off from my job.  The Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation sent me a one page (check the box) form for the "doctor" to complete and sign.  After faxing the PA the form and getting no response, I was finally (after numerous attempts) able to speak to a "nurse" who informed me that I would have drive down to his office and pay them $15.00 before the "doctor" would complete and sign the form.  Since I am a father of three and just lost my job, I did not have the gas money or the $15.00 to pay him.  I never did receive the completed and signed form.  I did, however, send unemployment proof of my attempts and an explanation of this doctor's extortion tactics.  Not my idea of an ideal doctor by any means.
5 Awesome Doctor! My husband and I have been seeing Dr Gartenberg for a bit over a year. We live in Glendale but happily drive to Scottsdale to see her. I found her online and after reading her website I was eagerly waiting for her clinic to open. I find her to be a perfect mix of traditional and Western medicine. Her bedside manner is fantastic and she takes her time with visits. She is also great with communication outside of the office. She has a secure online messaging system that she uses and it works great. If you're looking for a great doctor who uses both Eastern and Western/traditional medicine you can't go wrong here.
2 Dr. H has been my doctor as of the last few years.  When his clinic was on Alma School/Warner, I loved him.  He always made me feel comfortable and asked me about other non-related issues, ensuring there wasn't anything wrong with me.  Then he moved a little bit further south.  I have no idea if he changed with the move or what.  Suddenly, on every visit (1 every 6-8 months) he was quite dismissive to me and never helped me.  I always left there $20 short with no solutions.  My last visit was my LAST.  Him and another younger doctor pretty much laughed in my face about a problem they thought I was making up.  They gave me no solution and no advice.  I was so upset when I left because I'd been having a serious skin problem for months, that bothered me so much that it was interfering with my life.  I cried in the parking lot because here is my doctor and he can't help me and he won't even recommend another avenue.  Thankfully after 6 months I've seen other doctors and my problem is gone.  But not thanks to Dr. H.
1 The absolute worst gym in Montreal.  Staff walks around and think they are king shit on minimum wage.  HORRIBLE ENERGY AND PLACE.  You just want to leave the moment you walk in.  So you charge higher prices and that makes you better?  Idiots at large in here.
5 I was very pleased with the service. Stephanie is very professional and extremely nice. I left my appointment not only feeling great but with so much knowledge. I would definitely recommend.
1 The nursing staff at this doctors office are incredibly mean. There are very long waits to see a doctor continued by long waits in the exam room. Then the nurses rush you out even if you are still waiting to ask your doctor a question! I decided to find another doctor at another practice and could not be happier that I don't have to go back to North Scottsdale Family Medicine. Oh... and if you need to call and ask a nurse a question, you are out of luck. The nurses don't have voicemail when they are not in the office, and they are only in the office a couple days a week. This office is run like a communist county!
2 I am new to Las Vegas and am looking for a primary care physician.  I had heard good things about Dr. Pingol so I made an appointment.  I was told to be at the office 15 minutes early for my appointment so I could fill out my paperwork.  I arrived early and waited for 50 minutes during which time I started reading online reviews stating that it was normal to wait one to two hours for your appointment.   Dr. Pingol may be a fine doctor; however, in my opinion it is very inconsiderate to schedule someone and then let them sit waiting for an hour or more without any attempt to explain.  I got the feeling this is standard practice in Dr. Pingols office.   I left and won't be going back.  I would select one star but I did not get to see Dr. Pingol, so my rating is based off the office staff / efficiency alone.
5 Verve Wellness Center is truly one of a kind! You can get appointments for your Chiropractic care, Dental or Medical all in one day instead of driving all over town every day of the week. Not to mention the staff & providers actually care about the patients as family and go the extra mile. I've been a patient for over 9 years and always look forward to coming in to this first class facility! Thank you Dr. Warkentin for all your hard work on making Verve what it is today.
4 Based on the amazing reviews from Yelp, I thought I should give Toronto Bodyworks a try. I haven't had a massage in ages and needed the knots in my upper back, neck and lower back dealt with. The location was perfect, it wasn't too far from my workplace and home. The receptionist was really welcoming and the decor/atmosphere was really nice.   The initial assessment and history was done really thoroughly and based on the problems that I outlined, my RMT ensured that I was comfortable and described what he was going to be focusing the massage on.   Overall, it was a great experience. The price was a little more expensive then other places that I have been too, but based on location, it was definitely worth it.
3 Place needs interior over haul..the suite that my mom stayed wasn't too bad, but overall this is your typical city hospital.. old, crowded and always busy!
1 I wish there was a minus 2 stars I could have used instead. Cora at this office is a stuttering idiot and tried to lie her way out of giving my son his X-Ray without paying another copay. He was seen on 51st ave and was told by the Dr sense it was already 7:30pm he should wait until tomorrow to get it done on 27th Ave it was too late they close at 8pm. He gets there today and they ask for another $45 copay, why? This is a continuation of service. He went back to 51st and explained to their staff the issue, they called 27th ave and it was done, so he thought. Before he can get back to 27th Ave there was supposedly another call made that he has to pay, HUH? wtf. I call their call center with my son on the line and i get transferred to Cora who first tried too say she couldn't talk to me because he didn't give consent...son are you on the line, yes...keep talking Cora, she says he could have went somewhere else...nooooooo, the Dr said to come here not somewhere else. It was explained all over again and she said she would call the Dr, oh but he's off today, so when is he there again CORA...Saturday and Sunday then she says she is off Saturday and Sunday...so how is he going to be contacted CORA, she says I guess I can call him.....WTF..you guess? when CORA???? today I'll call him she says, when will my son get a call CORA...when the DR calls back, how soon is that CORA...he usually responds quickly, ok so why would you wait until basically Monday to call him since you're off and he's off on opposite days...crickets...CORA I will be down there today if I don't get a call by 7pm since you close at 8.  If you do not like your job get another one, if customer service is not your niche take a class, if common sense is something you lack, blame your momma.
1 Much of their services do not provide any real relief to back pain.  The services involved a heat treatment with tens machine and then stretching by Dr. Baca.  All of these things can be done at home and you save a copay.  He will try to get you on other services not needed to get more money into the practice.  He is one of very few that offer MUI services but most insurance providers do not cover so proceed with caution as they will tell you its 100% covered. The back office people are very non responsive, atrocious,  in calling back when questions are asked for insurance coverage.  What they will tell you is that it is covered only to find out from your health care provider that Triad never called.  Bottomline, don't waste your time/money on a service that does nothing when there are many more experienced chiroprators out there.
1 I was in need of a new PCP as my insurance had recently changed and thought I would give this place a shot since they are close to me. BIG MISTAKE! My first visit with Dr. Rumman was terrible. The "physical" she gave me was a joke and she didn't ask any questions about anything regarding my previous health history. The second visit was even more a of a joke as I actually had a health issue and she proceeded to diagnose me with a bogus diagnosis that I even I knew was not accurate. Dr. Rumman doesn't take the time to get to know you, she doesn't talk, she acts as if she is better then you and is one of those doctors that tries to get you in an out ASAP. I will NEVER RETURN!
5 Dr. Fern went out of his way to explain precisely the course of action he was going to take to alleviate the pain from my injury. I was impressed.
5 What an AMAZING pediatrians office! I have been taking my 2 1/2 year old here since she was first born and now my newborn son! Dr. Prentice is so knowledgeable and kind!! The office staff is great as well!
1 Horrible service. They only care about pocketing your money, I went in a couple of times to try it out and they won't stop bugging about signing paper. Needs  new manager asap. The promotions are such a joke too, nothing is as good as it sounds on advertisement. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY HERE
5 He take time and take care me like I am one of his family. My high blood presure get back to normal within a week. Now I have not taking any pills.
3 If you have go to the ER, they will get to you right away only if you have a life threatening emergency. With that said, I would say that about 99 percent of everybody who gets admitted does not qualify as life threatening.   If I was a producer, I would do a reality show just on the waiting lobby alone. Cuz if you sit there long enough, you will witness a crap load of drama unfolding with every minute. No need for a script or auditions for actors, it doesn't get any realer than this!   Took my wife here for a severe headache. Did the registration paperwork, etc. Then we sit and wait. This is where the magic begins.   Right off the bat the people we sat next to were tryin to sell us tamales. At the moment I wasn't hungry but remember this incident.   The lady to our left was in some kind of pain cuz she was hunched over and moaning. If you just walked in and was blind, you would think she was having some great sex cuz the whole time she was moanin, "Ohhhhhhh........Gooooooddddd! Oooohhhhhh Jesus!" This went on for about 2 hours before they finally admitted her. Wish I can post video with this review so you guys can get the full effect.   After about 4 hours we are admitted. Now mind you, their ER bays are very small and you are only separated by the sliding curtains. I didn't know there was an old guy next to us until he woke up screaming, "IT HURTS! IT HURTS!" The reason why he woke up was because his pain meds wore off so they gave him more morphine is what I heard the nurse say. What's  funny is once they give it to him, he was already asking when the next dosage was. If you ask me I think he was a morphine addict.  A couple of times I had to go back to the lobby because of a couple tests they had to do on my wife. Mind you I havnt eaten since lunchtime so I was starting to feel like Joe Pesci and the vending machine didnt have any Snickers of course. This is where the tamale dudes come in. Why they were still there I dont know. I didnt see any of them with a hospital band. Anyways, I got 2 beef tamales for 3 bucks. I was expecting the worse but it was actually good. Dont know if I was really hungry or these were the best tamales I ever had.  These are events that I wanted to convey that I thought seemed surreal because the whole time I was wondering when Ashton Kutcher was gonna jump out cuz I swear I was being punk'd. If I actually told you guys every single funny detail, then this would not be a review anymore. Could be construed as a biography.  Refer to my pic of the guy that has long gray hair. I swear he was a young clean shaven man when we first got there. The 4 hours we were in the waiting lobby you couldn't help but observe everything. I noticed everybody was on their phone and people actually brought their chargers knowing they were gonna be there a while. There were only 2 power outlets available so if you were one of the 4 lucky ones, time goes by faster for you. Of course, you cant go a couple hours without having to go to the bathroom. There are two unisex ones. Both stink, have no paper towels, and I dont think it matters if you use the sanitary cover sheets.   So my wife finally gets the medical attention she needs. Long story short, we showed up at 5 pm, got admitted at 9, went home at 4 am. I gotta say the service we received was extraordinary. The events leading up to it were what is quite memorable and im not so sure that is in a good way. So everything equals to just ok. When you first get there it all seems hopeless and forlorn. But the great medical service made up for it. Still wouldn't be one of my first choices though.
1 Terrible. Sent my referrals to the wrong fax number twice, delaying important appointments by more than a week. This was after I called and gave them the right information. Reception staff are incompetent! Also neglected to tell me I had to get clinic images myself and take them myself to the referral - another major delay. AVOID!
2 Dr. Lillo has always been very kind to me when I've been in his office. However, it is almost impossible to get a call back from him or his assistants. The message says not to leave multiple messages but what can you do if no one is returning your calls over several days or weeks.  I have a co worker that I referred to Dr. Lillo because as I said he is a nice doctor but my coworker is having the same trouble I am. No one calls him back. He's had test results in for over a month. He's contacted and confirmed with the lab that the results have been sent to Dr Lillo's office many times over and he has called and left a number of messages requesting a call back but has not heard from them.    Nice isn't enough. I won't be recommending Dr. Lillo again.
1 The Dr's themselves here are quite nice. Dr.Wu is very to the point and matter of fact. The office staff at the Henderson office is TERRIBLE AND INCOMPITENT! It is not just one incident but an accumulation of others as well. Do yourself a favor and try their other locations to see if you have any better luck! However, if you do want to be treated like crap then this is for sure your place! Sonja at the front desk may I recommend you get out of the customer service field. I honestly do not understand how you are still employed here!
5 All Star Health is awesome! They have an awesome, eager-to-serve staff and are always so easy to work with and helpful. Highly recommend!
5 Great, attentive staff. Extremely helpful in recovery process. Very competent office and therapy. I am glad to go to Edwin Suarez Physical Therapy.
5 Healing has never felt better! I met Rowena at a John F. Barnes Myofascial Release training in Women's Health. I had several treatment sessions with her. Like her, I am also highly trained in the field of JFB MFR and expect the best out of other therapists, she can deliver the results you want. She is confident, caring, talented, and has a great skill for listening to the patient and then getting down to business and delivering the therapy the client is looking for. If you are looking to truly heal from an injury, chronic pain, or you just want to feel better in general then I would highly recommend getting treatment from Rowena. Don't settle for a regular "massage" get Myofascial Release, it's the cutting edge and missing link to health care!
5 Dr Carter is the surgeon that operate on my right knee. It was an very extensive surgery and dr cater on his team made look like an walk in the park. The thing I liked the most was the care they all showed after it. Dr carter personally called my wife and made sure I was doing ok.  It's been 8 weeks and the recovery went well. Thank you to Dr carter and the entire TOCA camelback office for everything you guys did and still do for me .
5 Went for the free consultation today~my overall experience is amazing~the staff here r so nice~although this place is small compare to other gym but it's understandable since they only do personal training here~Adriano checked out my health assessment and did a bodily movement check up~made a few points that I should improve on and it was generally a great time~he is knowledgeable~although he did talk about taking supplement vitamins and things like that~but he is not really pushy about it. If u r someone who is really looking to change not only your body but your whole life style~this is the place you need to come~they teach you so much here~and I m looking forward to start my training here~ the pricing here is in normal range just like everywhere else of the gym~1hr session can range from 85-100$ depend on the type of program u purchase~they also do student discount~yay~I m so happy I have found this place~can't wait to update my progress
1 I've been here for 2 hours and haven't seen a doctor yet. As someone in the medical field... There is no obvious reason for the wait. There were 4 people in the waiting room when I got here. It took over an hour to get into a room and now I've been in a room for over 40 min and counting... I won't be back.   Do yourself a favor, go somewhere else or you're likely to die of old age.
5 One of the best, most complete, and thorough chiropractor in AZ.
1 Staff incompetent on filling prescriptions. Have been trying to get a prescription filled for 7 days and literally have left 15 messages. Office staff have assured me they have sent urgent messages to the doctor and still no prescription. Pretty frightening from a patient perspective. This happened to me last year also.
5 Drew and his entire staff go above and beyond to help you heal and work with you to return to excellent mobility after surgery or a fall.
4 I'm a fan.  This center is pretty new to the neighborhood , and I really appreciate the new kid on the block.  We've  visited a few times and each time the office is pleasant and well kept, the staff is attentive and courteous, and the doctors are knowledgeable and friendly.    What a breath of fresh air. Thanks to Urgent Care Extra -Cheyenne doctors, staff, and especially PA Boesiger for really taking care of my Dad!
5 Jimmy is my dr he is phenomenal he rehabbed my torn labrum in my shoulder back to normal back in the 500lb range on my bench again . I can't begin to say how incredible he is and knows exactly what and where to do what he was trained for , I'm back two years later working on my patellar tendon working on my knee , nobody says it's easy but you know when this guy works on you painful as may be in the end you know how great my knee will be and I will be back to 100%!soon enough. This is the dr jimmy can't pronounce is last name if you want the best results see him he's incredible. If your an athlete and need to get it done and done go see him you won't regret it.
5 I have been coming to this clinic since it opened. I've seen almost all the doctors who have gone through the office.  Two have been outstanding; Dr Hailstone and Courtney PA.   Both are young and what I think of small town doctors to be. Nothing like the doctors I've seen all my life in Las Vegas. They actually listen and respond with compassion  The front desk staff is also excellent. It wasn't always that way but it is now. The MA's are always good as is Dr Forte herself.
5 I've been going to Dr. Petrick on and off for over 5 years now.   He is incredibly kind, dedicated, professional, and effective!!!   In my first visit he practically cured pain I had been experiencing for untold years, after three visit's the pain was gone. I now only go for maintenance every few months.   You have nothing to lose, and everything to gain.  If you do your part at home, he can fix you.....
5 So, been going to family doctors of green valley for some time now.  What I receive is a high level of customer service to which is a direct result of my doctor v having a great bedside manner.  Staff is friendly, but it's nice to have a doctor who cares. Yea sometimes you'll wait a bit, but I feel the service is worth it.
4 I wish I could repeat the bad reviews but I've been here for several years and have Dr. Dicke as  primary care physician. I like his bedside manner and have had no issues with him.  Only reason I'd take one star off is similar to another customer. I fell ill the day before an appointment and wanted to see a doctor, any doctor and was told that "your primary doctor really prefers seeing his old patients. It wasn't something that forced me to go to the ER but I was surprised by it and disappointed. Otherwise I personally can vouch for only Dr. Dicke.
2 Dr Putlitz helped me when i was in so much pain! Although i felt like i was on a convener belt and we were all just herded thru. no personalization. i was having a epidural and i was already in agony. he asked me why i was crying. I won't be going back I also saws a surgeon  who was the meanest rudest doctor i have ever experienced! I will be going some where else!
2 Dr. Cruz is no longer there.  I called to see if she returned from her "indefinite" leave and was told she was no longer there so now I start again with a whole new physician and office.
5 Clean and friendly. Doctor dawn Austin is super friendly and very helpful when it comes to your questions!
1 Dr Chad Campbell (the only good physician this practice had) IS NO LONGER HERE!  BEWARE OF THIS PLACE!  I have been going here since I was 11 years old and loved it until James Harris left. I asked for an appt with an MD, but received one with an NP. Then when I was told my problem could be helped with a muscle relaxer, I asked to have the only one I was previously prescribed years ago. I asked for as little as 10 for a 3 month supply (which is very little, but I was trying to make a point that I only needed it therapeutically every so often and am not a drug seeker). She refused. Said she would prescribe a different one, and didn't. Said I could speak with one of the doctors, yet when I asked to.. he was suddenly too busy. A few days later I received a letter in the mail that they could no longer provide service to me.  This practice is quite apparently an absolute joke. I would not take my child here if her life depended on it. It's quite sad to see what this place has evolved into after 16 years of going here.  Also, at my visit prior to this... Dr Lebeau didn't even do anything to assess my issue. He immediately referred me out; even without doing preliminary testing. Working in the medical field for 7 years, I know this is quite ridiculous.   I would only go here if you enjoy wasting your time and money.
5 Dr. O is absolutely amazing! He really CRACKED me up! Both physically and figuratively. :) He's very funny and really enjoys his job. I went in with some killer lower back pain and now I feel great. I'm gonna come back at least once every two weeks now. Maybe even once a week! His prices are very good considering his talent and the feel of the atmosphere is wonderful. I am very relaxed every time I go in. COME SEE DR. O!!!!!!!! HE'S THE ABSOLUTE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!! #YAS
4 Dr Spector took great care of us once we were able to see him.
5 I have been a patient here for 4 years. The staff is caring and kind. I have always been greeted with a smile.  The care has been excellent.  Dr. Tom Willim has been a blessing. He saved my life and has given me a future!. When other doctors didn't help me, he did.  He took the time to research,  refer, and cure!! Thanks Warner Family. You are all awesome
5 Im stunned by the other review.  This is my new health care provider.  1. Top service by the girls in the front 2.  Never TOO hard to get an appt 3. Dr. Fruchtman is really good.  Listens, spends time, then treats 4. Never had a problem with payment or insurance  Note - you should stop saying you accept walk-ins if you really dont, really
1 Sketchiest "walk-In clinic" I've ever stepped foot in. I walked in and it seemed more like a spa than a doctors office. There was literally no indication of it being a medical office at all. I asked the receptionist if it was and she replied yes, then asked for my health card. After taking my health card she told me that the doctor wasn't in yet (it was 930) and she didn't know when he would be in. Then she started putting in my information, but she couldn't read my health card. She asked me which one was my first, middle, and last name. Clearly she had no experience reading health cards. Next she asked me for my drivers licence and at this point I really started to wonder what I had walked into. I proceeded to ask for my health card back and leave, however, I do wish I had asked why she needed my drivers licence as that is NOT a normal request at a walk in clinic.   Don't go here... unless you're looking to donate some organs..
1 This is the most heartless doctors office I have ever dealt with.  My 89 year old father went in this morning for blood work.  He had a bad day yesterday, not being able to wake up. I asked, while he his here, can we get his blood pressure and pulse taken.  The answer from three of the girls up front was NO. Make an appointment.  I had a similar event happen with my mother.  They don't care about people, just their system.
5 I was pretty miserable for a week and a half so I knew I needed to go see a Doc. Well we finally found an Urgent Care that was open past 5 (I know, HUH?) and took walk-ins after 4pm (I KNOW!!). So we were searching and finally found one open till 9pm!  We got the with an hour to spare! The staff there did NOT even remotely feel rushed, they were very fast, very efficient and they weren't kidding when the doctor would be in, in a couple minutes! They did the usual, blood pressure, pulse oc and questions before, and after the Dr. listened, sure enough, just as I thought it was pneumonia/bronchitis. So 5 prescriptions and a shot in the butt later, I was off!  AND with papers telling describing the ailments I have and what was prescribed and what they do also! (I wish ALL doctors would do this! And 15 minutes BEFORE 9pm. Really nice, really helpful and very professional people there. I HIGHLY recommend this location (Durango/Cheyenne) and I saw Dr. Frank Urbina who treated me really well and was a very nice man.
1 Very disappointed with this practice. I had gone here for several years (and they got my money for pellets) but when I was diagnosed with breast cancer they never followed up once! They were my primary care physicians, so they got the call after my mammogram and were the ones to call me to deliver the news. Never heard from them again! I think they are too focused on making money and not really treating the patient, so beware if you want a doctor who really cares!
1 This MD is a senile old fool, who doesn't care about his patient's welfare. For 5 days asked to transfer my RX to my new insurance. Everyday told no, dealing with other patients, but would call 3 p.m. today & conference in my new insurance. They didn't call, so I called them, with no answer. I drove down and the office was closed, during office hours. I had the MD paged & he refused to help b/c he said I didn't meet the requirements for a prior authorization. Had he reviewed my chart he would see he already wrote the RX & just needed a transfer. I had the MD paged again & the response was I was dropped from the practice! So now I'm without a doctor, which not having him as mine is probably for the best, but now I only have 3 more days of RX and not sure what to do at this point. Too bad Lofgreen's Hippocratic oath that doesn't mean anything at all in his practice.
1 They treated me before and after a Lumbar spine Laminectomy. Before, I was required by my insurance to go through PT to approve surgery. It took 3 visits to convince them that PT was too painful and I told them I would see them after my surgery. When I came back for treatment after my Laminectomy I don't feel like they listened to my needs specifically to change any protocol based on my personal statements of how it was going and pain I was still having. They used the Mckenzie method which has you do exercises to push/bend backwards. I'm not a clinician or doctor but this method does not seem to have worked for me. Just be sure you ask a lot of questions and push back if what the therapist is doing does not work for you. Check with your doctor to make sure it is the right method for your case.
5 I have been here twice. Found on yelp. Great staff. Never too busy. Perfect waiting room.
1 Been here more times than I can count. The medical assistants are far more helpful than most of the PAs. Peter Tretheway is amazing. Very thoughtful and takes his time to provide you with every drop of information and answer a million questions if you have them. That being said, we brought my son in about a month ago with a terrible bleeding rash rash. One PA gave us burn cream. It did nothing. We called back a day or two later and the medical assistant spoke with Tretheway who said that was a terrible prescription, sent a new one in and BAM he was better. Today we brought my son infant son in with a fever, A roseola like rash, irritability, no desire to eat, etc. Randall Sorrentino didn't even let us speak. He told us "100 degrees isn't a fever, 100.6 is", didn't let us finish a sentence, referred to my son as an "it" or "the", MY husband repeated him multiple times and still couldn't get a word in. Sorrentino will literally run out the door to avoid you. We went home and my son's rash worsened. He wouldn't eat and was simply miserable. With what another PA told us were the "telltale symptoms of roseola and definitely something else", we went to another urgent care. The new place stayed open late for us and actually looked at his ears and did a head to toe. The new PA immediately found what she said was a terrible double ear infection and that he needed antibiotics immediately. Tretheway wouldn't listen to my concerns about amoxicillin considering a strong family history and gave us a steroid cream for a "I don't know, maybe a contact thing". He then told us that he also wrote us a prescription for amoxicllin and not to come back in if it gets worse and to just fill it and give it to him. I appreciate the thought, but I'm not looking to give my kid drugs without a doctor saying he needs them. He also told us that he doesn't care about the runny nose unless it's running yellow. It's a pretty known fact nowadays that you can be sick without running yellow. This is about our 5th TERRIBLE experience with Tretheway but something always happens that we end up there with him. This includes a misdiagnosed hand injury that has resulted in chronic pain and disfigurement. NEVER AGAIN. I will take my family to the ER in south Phoenix before I take them here. Feel bad for the good PA, Tretheway, the manager (who helped in getting my son's first rash healed), and the amazing MAs. They don't deserve to be associated with this guy. Please read the other reviews and you can see I'm not the only one. If you do go and get stuck with this guy, yell if you have to. Say what you need to say because he won't listen. Best of luck.
4 I have now been back twice and even though you are lucky if you get 60 seconds with he doc, compared to the place I left because I was getting nowhere with them, progress is great!  I had cortisone shots in knees and shoulders.  There was so much more in the syringe it scared me but it worked whereas the last  practice did the same thing and also charged me for something they didn't do... and it worked minimally and didn't last, this seems to have worked and the bill was correct.
5 These guys make it their mission to support their community and have fun doing it! The atmosphere here is energetic and fun. That's not to say the PT's here make light of their work. They are true masters of their craft, transforming lameness to gracefulness and bringing a life of normalcy back to people who have endured crippling trauma.
2 My first visit we waited 3 hours and now we are back again so far waiting 2 hours! This office has no consideration for their patients time! Completely unprofessional! I have a few titles and degrees after my name, maybe I should start billing them for my time!
5 Dr Lam and his staff are very professional. They will not lead you into buying product or treatments that will not work for you. Love them!
2 Bought a massage through Groupon. Arrived early to fill out paperwork and after waiting a few minutes they handed me 5 pages of very detailed medical questions to answer. I told them i was just having a massage but they insisted i fill it out. After finishing the paperwork and waiting another 15 minutes for the masseuse to arrive i was led back to some sort of room that doubled as a storage/massage room. No apologies for being 20 minutes late to begin the massage. The massage itself was good but he never had me flip onto my back in order to massage the flip side:( my main gripe was that my massage was cut short because of his tardiness. Front desk staff could certainly use some coaching on being more cordial and helpful as well.
5 I went in to see Dr. J after my sister-in-law had been telling me for months that she thought he could help me as he had helped her feel great in the past. I had been having back spasms, especially after a round of golf and being an avid golfer, playing 1-2 times per week I was miserable. I felt significantly better after the first visit and have continued to improve after each and every visit. Dr. J is caring, knowledgeable and a great Doctor! -Thanks Dr. J you rock!!!
5 Wunderschönes Ambiente mit viel Holz. Preiswerte sehr hochwertige Massagen, sowie einen wunderschönen Sauna und Relaxbereich. Habe bislang durchweg gute Erfahrungen mit dem RuhePol gemacht. Bislang habe ich noch keinen einzigen Besuch bereut
5 I only write reviews for businesses that I've had a good experience at because I've seen what can happen to a business if they have a poor online reputation.  I hope this stays on this page because I genuinely had a great experience here.  I also am a grateful person in general and when I see someone working hard, I appreciate it all the more.    I won a free massage after Camelback Medical Center came to my office to promote their services and offered us all free 10 minute massages.  I actually went into the massage a bit grumpy because I couldn't find the place.  (its next to zipps!)  The staff was incredibly friendly.  I honestly have never seen a medical staff so dedicated to making me feel welcome.     The massage itself was very professional and the masseuse explained why certain things were hurting and helped me sort out the root of some of my tension.    I do want to note (for all of the negative nancy's that will give this place a bad review), that yes... the room could have been more isolated and I did hear some of the physical therapy that was going on in the next room.  The music throughout the session could have also been better.  All in all, the place was so friendly, my masseuse was incredibly kind and educated, and I left feeling very happy.  THAT to me, is a very good experience.    Also, if you plan to visit, PLEASE don't forget that gratuity is expected.  There are too many ignorant people who think that because something is "free", the person providing them service is taken care of.
1 These folks are still O.K. for general Xrays and cleanings, but when I had more extensive work done (crowns), the competence (of the doctor) went out the door!  She cracked the crown while trying to tweak it, then passed the blame on to the lab she uses to create the crown!  When I reminded her that I had to drive 5 hours to get back there for a return appointment, she said: "Well, you don't want me to give you a crown that doesn't fit right, do you?"    What a moron . . . and one who won't take responsibility for her actions.
5 Maria has been my primary care doctor for approximately a year and a half now. I was referred to her by my insurance and could not be more happy.   Maria is caring, thoughtful, compassionate and takes her time with me as a patient. She listens and responds as if you were talking to a friend. I have never had a doctor that I liked so much or felt as comfortable around. I am very nervous when it comes to doctors of any kind, if you are like me, then you will feel comfortable with Maria and her staff.   Sandy is up front, very sweet and precise. Gabino is Maria's nurse. He is amazing also. The entire staff is bilingual which is a plus.   The office is clean, comfortable and cool. Netflix is always playing in the waiting area with something funny on. It's a good distraction if you get nervous at doctors offices like I do.   The office is called Machuca Family Medicine. They have 3 offices total. I have only been to their main office once for a follow up for blood work results. I saw Dr. Machuca and he is just as nice/pleasant as Maria. All around, 5 stars for everything and everyone.   Thank you to all of the staff for doing what you do.
1 I'm so disappointed in this office. I was seen for influenza about 2 weeks ago and have requested to speak with my doctor Dr. Wallace or nurse practitioner via their verbal instruction and voicemail and have yet to receive a call from them. Audrey that works up at the front desk is a constant frustration. I could understand if my doctor is too busy during the day hours to speak with me but I am also frustrated with his nurse practitioner Angie that keeps pushing her follow-up phone calls on to the front desk because "she has too many patients and she can't take care of everyone." You guys are good for each other, keep failing miserably. It's working so well for you based on all the 5star reviews you have. Lol
5 I've been a regular client at Step Up since I came down with a screaming case of sciatica last December. I'd never visited a chiropractor before, but Dr. Karen was great from the start. My recovery was slow, but the laser therapy and adjustments that she did to help with the pain definitely shortened the duration of the flare and had me back on my feet faster. I've been back to see her after a terrible fall at work that left me with a bone chip and bad pain in my ankle. She's helped me make a speedy recovery. Through a mix up in booking I ended up seeing Natalie for a massage. The first was just a quick 30 minute, but she did such a great job that I booked an hour the next week to help relax my nerves and ease inflammation. It was probably one of the best massages I've had. The pressure was perfect and I honestly felt like she was completely in tune with my muscles. I felt like jello after.  I also went to see Dr. Julie Hwang for some Naturopathic therapy. Her recommendations honestly changed my life. The magnesium malate she prescribed for me has helped me with sleep, anxiety, nerve and muscle pain and almost obliterated my period cramps. Their prices may be a little higher than other clinics, but the service is amazing and everyone is really professional. When my body goes out of whack, I come to Step Up to get back on track. Thanks to everyone there for Fixin' me up so I can get back in the game!
5 Tucked away and somewhat hard to find in an office building across the street from the Kierland Commons, a decent massage, better than you get at any Massage Envy, can be had on the cheap - around $50 or so.  Keep in mind that there is no spa experience here - if you woke up and found yourself in their waiting room, you could just as easily mistake this place for your accountant's office.   However, the massage with Katie was better than average - I've gotten both better and worse at the Phoenician and Biltmore spas...for triple the money. Being here for another month, I'd have purchased a package if they'd offered. However, the receptionist saw my out-of-town address and told the therapist to forget about asking me. I'd have spoken up, but I'm not in the habit of forcing money onto businesses.   Anyway, you can't really go wrong with this place - if you get a great massage (and you probably will), then all is well; if you don't, you're only out $50 or so.  They get four stars from me (plus one for having a Seinfeld book on the coffee table). Thanks. Katie.
1 Avoid this place at all costs - I have been going for years and will not be back! The doctor basically did nothing and accused me of lying to get a simple refill. Gave a me long unnecessary tests - I think it is a scam to get more insurance money!
5 I can only speak about my experience with Dr. George and his staff and it has been nothing except wonderful. I worked with Dr.'s in Ohio for many years and when I first moved to Vegas I was disheartened by the medical field here. I went to many Dr.s who just could have cared less about spending time with me. Dr. George is different. I first met with him before delivering my daughter as he was listed on my insurance. He was great about getting me in and spending time with me at no cost so I could ask questions (being a first time Mom this was huge for me). He provided such excellent care for my baby I switched to him as well since I was at my wits ends with my current Dr. and I never looked back. He listens to me no matter what I am dealing with . I will never forget my work screwed my insurance election up and I had an appointment for my daughter on Jan 2. I had no money because I had been out on FMLA for 2 months with a wound revision surgery to my C-section and was dealing with my short term disability plan not paying what they were supposed to and needless to say I was done with it all. Crying in the waiting room I told the girl just to cancel my appointment because I had nothing to pay them with. I started walking out the door and Dr. G ran after me telling me that it was fine and that he would never not see a child due to lack of funds. I knew then I had a Gem. He got us in a room and let me vent about all the crap I was going through with FMLA and people not doing there jobs right (and this was before I was a patient). I felt so much better after that. Not everyone has the same experiences with Dr.'s and this is true with a lot of different aspects of life. The most important thing is for you to feel comfortable with who you choose. Take reviews as a tool for picking someone but ultimately come to your own conclusions. I love Dr. G and can not thank him enough for what he has done for myself and my daughter.
5 LOVE this place. Extremely knowledgeable, accommodating and (most importantly) friendly staff. I'm a new regular-- I admit that Bikram, no matter where you go, IS on the pricey side-- but the health and sanity benefits I've experienced since starting my practice outweighs the $99/month charge.   It is a TOUGH workout. Seriously. The only goal your first class is simply to stay in the room for the full 90 minutes. It's intense-- but you will have the greatest sense of accomplishment once you are done! I've recommended this place to many of my friends, and not one of them has been disappointed.  BYT frequently advertises unlimited month-long memberships on Groupon, which I highly suggest purchasing. That's how I got started!  It's definitely NOT hoity-toity or snooty. The other yogis are super-nice, REAL people who are supportive of each other.  Also, they just had a remodel of their lobby and changing room areas. Classy, eco-friendly & beautiful!  Bottom line? If you are adventurous enough to try a legit DIFFICULT workout, Bikram Yoga Tempe is definitely the place to go.
1 I waited too, forever. They told me it was because they were implementing a new computer system. I went in for a blood test at 10 am, I waited until 11 am to have the blood drawn after I had been fasting since the previous night.   I was a little surprised when I went into the office for bioidentical hormones because most of the patients were men who were far too muscular. The treatment she gave me, testerone, made me sick. I got acne in my public area. Nothing, absolutely nothing was said to me about the possible side effects or health risks of what she was giving me. I smoke and you are not even supposed to take anything like that when you do. Also, because they use a compounding pharmacy, they are not required to give you any handouts with the medication regarding possible side effects.  The really frustrating part is that she told me that 'most' of the tests would be covered by the wellness plan on my insurance. The bill is over $2000. After many, many calls to my insurance provider, Vitality and Quest Diagnostics, guess what? Not covered, even though they had all the insurance info prior to doing the tests.They are only interested in making money. Everyone in the office calls her 'Dr Thomas' and she only has a phd, she is not a medical doctor.  One more thing, the nurse didn't change the paper on the medical table prior to my examination, I had to ask her to do it.
1 And THEN Dr. Amanda Thistle was no longer there.  It became Kerstin Margiotti, which is who I saw sometime around January or February '13.  Apparently she left in June 2013 after swearing up and down to me she'd be there for quite some time.  This practice is a joke.  Go elsewhere.
1 This place is horrible!  If you come here get ready to be treated like an animal, wait a long time and hash out $10-20 just for parking. I will never come back here.   Here's my story:  They allow appointments but you still have to wait an hour if you show up for the appointment. If you walk in they see people with appointments before you. They are completely inconsistent and just make random decisions on whom they want to see first.  I called around 10 am one day and the receptionist told me the current waiting time is 20 minutes. I said I would come immediately but she insisted I come at 1 and that she will make an appointment for me. She said the doctor will see me at 1. I got there at 12.55 but they gave me an extra hour waiting time!   All I needed was to review a chest x-ray for a suspected pneumonia. The receptionist said they received the report but no doctor will see it for another 3-5 days and they will call me. Pneumonia is no laughing matter but they didn't care. I had to push them to let me come in to review the results in person with the doctor. I ended up paying $25 in parking alone.
2 The staff and Dr. Jonathan are very friendly and welcoming, and the location is clean and well-maintained.   I ultimately had a short-lived attendance to this location because I wasn't very confident in the knowledge of pre-natal adjustments and variety of treatment available. Having come from another chiropractor (whom I loved but he was out of network and that becomes expensive very quickly), I felt uncomfortable with the amount of questions about what treatment my previous chiropractor did and being told that the treatment I could receive here is limited due to my pregnancy. Most of my appointment was filled by using a hand held massager on sore areas, which is something I could do myself at home, and I was told I should lay on an ice pack. This was not the same as the care and conversations I'd received from my previous chiropractor. I also felt uncomfortable because I noticed my pain increasing after my adjustments here, and cancelled all future appointments as a result.   However, for non-pregnant patients, I can see how this may be a good location for them.   Personally, if I come to a doctor, being told that there's little you can do for me makes me feel that you are inexperienced in this particular area, especially when another doctor was able to do much more.
5 Dr. Perez is a very thorough doctor. Takes his time with his patients. Highly recommend him for all family wellness needs.
5 The staff and doctors at Backfit provide excellent care and service. They provide multiple care technics and physical therapy. Most of my beck pain is gone!  Nice job.
5 My family has been treated by Dr. Tosca since my now three year old was three days old.  At that time Dr. Tosca worked at a different practice but we followed him when he moved to Kachina Family Practice a year ago, even though it is now a 30 mile round trip drive to see him.  We now have a 4 month old as well, and I can't imagine taking her to see anyone else.    We have always been able to see Dr. Tosca same day for illness. He seems to genuinely care about all of his patients and always takes the time to answer any questions we have - will even printout out information on uncommon conditions.  He is also respectful about concerns we have, even if sometimes our views may differ some from his.  I really love that he is equally good at treating my children, my husband and me, because it is so nice to have a true family doctor.  He makes us feel as though we are his favorite patients!  We have also seen Dr. Fischbeck twice, and if I couldn't see Dr. Tosca for some reason, I would be happy seeing Dr. Fischbeck.    Kachina's office space is very comfortable and family friendly.  The exam rooms are all warm and inviting, with personal touches from the doctors, like photos of their families or travels.   The staff there has always been very friendly and helpful.  I love that they do reminder calls two days before your appointment.  This really helps if you have somehow forgotten about the appointment, more so than calls the day before (or no calls at all).  Unlike another reviewer, I have never felt the reception or nursing staff was rude or uncaring.  We had some major insurance problems a few months ago, and the administrative staff was very helpful and understanding.  I will admit that we probably did have a closer relationship with the reception and nursing staff at Dr. Tosca's prior practice, but everyone's personalities are different and I whole-heartedly recommend Kachina Family Practice.
4 Dr. Matt Teusink is awesome! Saved my damaged back many times. A good person to see if you have back issues!
5 In response to the review from JJ I can assure you as a former staff member this is not the case. The Practices Policy is clearly stated that Pharma lunches are attended by the Providers first in order to meet with the reps uninterrupted. After 1:30 and/or all the available Providers have met with the reps, the staff may enjoy the lunch provided. Many times at the end of the day remaining lunch is offered to the staff and Providers.
5 My first visit to Wonderful Smiles was at the beginning of November after I got my braces off. I went in for an initial exam to see what had to be done after having my braces on for 2 1/2 years. I know it has only been about 2 months, but they have been my favorite dental office. The staff there are very friendly and professional the dentists are as well. They are thorough with every explanation of your treatment. I really do enjoy going to Wonderful Smiles and I have recommended them to all my family and friends.
5 I went here and the wait was a bit long, however the staff was amazing. The receptionist was very pleasant and was willing to answer any questions.  The nurse apologized and said she was working solo due to a nurse that quit. She was friendly and was so thankful for our patience. They were just recently bought out by Banner and seem to be going through growing pains.   I visited late about an hour before closing and Dr Randall was patient and did not rush me. He made me feel like my care was important. Their printer was down and he stayed late to hand write my prescriptions. I would definitely visit this urgent care in the future.
2 They have done a horrible jib of caring for my mother.  The nursing staff is less than responsive making her wait for medication much longer than necessary.  Also the Dr is a joke.   Doesn't even stop by to see new patient (when he got back from vacation) even after being told that I was waiting with my mother to see him.  They do have a nice newer clean facility and a good restaurant .
5 Renee is a talented and compassionate therapist.  She knew right away what was bothering me by the way I walked.  She answered all my questions, explained the cause, and taught me how to correct and heal my injury.  I am grateful for her care and highly recommend Renee!
5 I have been seeing Preferred Physical Therapy for 3 weeks to help with a knee problem. After evaluation, Nick Hunter and his staff set up, and supervised, a therapy program which has helped to eliminate almost all of the pain I was experiencing, and getting me on the way to a full recovery. I am an avid golfer, and up to last week, I was not able to even think about golfing. Now, with his in-office repertoire and my home exercises, I am back to golfing again. PPT was one of the PT offices recommended by my personal physician. I admit I chose PPT because of proximity, but, I have been extremely happy with the results to date. I might also add this is a small office and personal attention during visits is one of their prime assets.
5 Anyone who has suffered an injury should seriously visit Scott for a THERAPUTIC massage!  He has grt. understanding of how the bodily details work together for maximum healing.  He is also acquainted with kinesiology and reflexology.  Good treatments if you're hurting and want to reach full recovery.  L.
5 We love  my left foot childrens therapy. Our family is from Honolulu, Hawaii. We come here for speech therapy. I would travel there in an instant before being faced with the terrible pediatric speech therapy we are faced with in hawaii. They are able to calm my son so quickly and help him learn.   his tantrums are calmed in seconds. THey dont restrain him like other therapists have.They try to understand him and find how HE learns best.   We miss you all and hope to see you soon!!
1 Was told to be here for a drug screening mandated by work at noon. I get here at noon and they tell me I'm looking at a 45 minute wait. Receptionist seems very unfamiliar with her position. Very very frustrating experience. *** finally seen after over an hour wait. Nurse was nice but I hope I never have to come here again.
5 The staff at Backfit are both caring and attentive. I always feel like family walking in. They have medical professionals on staff as well so I can stop in for general health and wellness issues. Also the front staff is very flexible with scheduling and finances to make sure that you are getting the best care possible. They don't want finances to get in the way of being healthy. Their care goes above and beyond every time.
5 I've been to the L& D ward once in my pregnancy so far. The staff was very nice and I was seen right away. They were helpful and gentile and made me feel reassured.   They offer free childbirth classes, classes for kids becoming an older sibling for the fist time, and free 'daddy boot camp' classes and we've taken advantage of them!  I know some people say bad things about this hospital, but I've only had good experiences with them!
1 I have been a patient of Dr. Michael Wolff and Gretchen Post, PA at Southwest Spine and Sports for over 8 years.  I have spent 10s of thousands of dollars with the practice.  In the past I have received good service from the medical staff, however, the treatment has gone down hill quickly.  First I will start off with the front desk girls and the phone staff, they are terrible.  Out of all the medical practices I have been to, only once have I seen staff worse.  They are almost completely incompetent.  Dr. Michael Wolff and Physician's Assistant Gretchen Post used to be very caring doctors who would do whatever they could in a timely fashion for their patients.  The practice has obviously grown too fast and is so large, that the doctors think they are Gods and walk around with an unbelievable aloofness.  I guess they are so busy and wealthy now, that they can afford to not even return a long time patients phone call in a time of need.  If you are looking for a pain doctor, I would look somewhere else.  Stay far away from Southwest Spine and Sports, they are highly egotistical and could care less about their patients.
5 THE DIGS: Just walking in here makes you feel better with all the bright colors and positive vibe and demeanor. As you can see from my photos and the ones posted by others the place has modern contemporary decor. A very large screen TV to entertain the kids or watch the game. Th waiting room is thoughtfully laid out and it extremely comfortable. One side of the room has a light game feature the kids can play with. Its one of those light features that move when you touch it. The place is always sparkling clean and bathrooms look like you walked into a resort bathroom. I keep expecting some dude to hand me a towel.  THE SERVICE: So all the fancy decor and flashy doesn't amount to a hill of beans unless the staff is on point right? Well this staff certainly is. In the times been here they have always been very courteous and professional. The seem to be well trained in how to handle high pressure situations and difficult patients. They are knowledgeable and certainly make you feel comfortable and welcome for the duration of your visit. The longest time I've spent in this clinic was an hour from check in to check out. One time I was in and out in 18 minutes.   THE LOCATION: Very easy to find right on Cheyenne off of Soring Gulls. In the Albertson shopping center. It used to be a blockbuster.   Most major insurance is accepted. Open on Sundays till 9pm.
5 I have a very rare autoimmune disease and am on a lot of medications. Needless to say, my doctor plays a huge role in my healthcare and well being.  One day, after 5-years of care, my doctor told me that my disease took up too much of his time and he couldn't treat me anymore.   I was shocked, very afraid and I needed a Primary Care Physician fast!  After having a very hard time finding a doctor that would be willing to treat me with all of my "problems", a friend of mine told me to try Dr. Matin at Care MD.  I set up and appointment immediately.... and it was the best thing I ever did for myself.  The staff is like family to me, and Dr. Matin is not only one of the greatest Doctors I've ever had, he's like family and treats me like his.  He is the kind of doctor who will spend the time with you and not make you feel rushed.  I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Matin and Care MD if you're looking for a family practice doctor.  You'll be as happy as I am.
5 I absolutely love this office and am so glad it's super close to my house.  I have seen Dr. Trinidad twice now and he is very personable and has a great bed side manner.  He's genuinely caring and very easy to talk to.  Lisette is a great tech/nurse.  She is very easy going and if you have had a hard time with people poking you several times, trying to find a good vein, you don't have to worry about this with her.  She's excellent, takes her time, and puts you at ease.
5 I've seen dozens of doctors and been in countless offices, clinics, and hospitals, AOSM is by far the best I've ever been to! The Front Office ladies are a pleasure to work with; as many times as I've been in the office and/or called, they've never been unpleasant. The assistants are wonderful and so very helpful. The PA I saw post-op was fantastic and really took the time to explain things in a way anyone could understand. And, of course, Dr. Yee is by far one of the best doctors I've ever seen! He introduced himself by first name and genuinely listened to everything I said, seemingly happy to help; definitely not the typical rushed and cold feeling most doctors give their patients. Out of, now, three knee surgeries, this one was the best experience, least pain, and quickest recovery. Two close friends have seen other Doctors at AOSM and were both extremely impressed as well. He and his office are, in my seasoned opinion, the very best Las Vegas (or anywhere else) could offer!  If you're looking for a great Orthopedic Surgeon, look no further than AOSM!!
1 I'm new here and haven't established a primary care physician yet. I went to the new office at Queen Creek and Higley and saw Steven King. Appt went fine and I got an RX for conjunctivitis. I took it for the prescribed 7 days and inadvertently reinfected myself 3 days later. I only had drops for 4 more days. Called for a refill on them and they would only do it if I came back in (and paid another $60 copay). No one could tell me which location King might be at, including their corporate number. I could see if I was sick and not getting better but we're talking pink eye. I guess they are a "Once and Done" facility.... I won't be going back.
3 Great place to come and workout at. Pretty quiet in the mornings and before 3pm. Otherwise crowded as heck which means machines all swooped up.   One area that might need some improvement would be the Sauna. Love sitting in here before or after a workout, but hard to when it's 'Out of Order' - last time I came in the door was broken and one couldn't even properly shut the door without getting burned by the screw.   Theater is pretty awesome when you want to get away from the madness of the overcrowd and it makes cardio go by a lot quicker.   Welcoming staff and trainers too.
1 THIS PLACE IS THE WORST! I WOULD GIVE IT 0 STARS IF THAT WERE AN OPTION!  You cant call and talk to a real person without them transferring you to a voicemail!!!   I was a new patient and called to set up an appointment, that part was easy (although i couldnt get an appointment for more than a week out) no one asked me for any insurance information at that time. Then 24 hours before my appointment they call me and say that if I do not give my insurance information right away that my long awaited appointment would be cancelled. Well, I was at work and did not have that information with me so they cancelled it. Why didnt they call earlier on or at the time I made the appointment ask for my insurance info?!   I HAVE NEVER HAD SUCH BAD TREATMENT FROM A MEDICAL FACILITY.
5 He's a really good doctor. I don't know about pricing because my insurance covers everything. But I've been actively here for the last few months and the staff is nothing but helpful! Jarvis is really good at recommending things and he really takes the time to sit down and figure out all your problems. Sometimes there is a wait to get in even with an appointment, but that's every where. It only happens because he's trying to figure out every detail about your issues!
5 This is the best place to get fixed in Phoenix/Old Town. Always recommend my customers (runners/triathletes) to these guys for any serious or nagging injuries. They offer great help, a fun atmosphere, great strengthening classes, and will work tirelessly to get you back to 100%
5 Great staff. Very friendly. Clean offices. Quick n efficient. Will drive across town to go again if needed
5 The person that gave YMT three stars obviously misunderstood the clinic. This isn't a place you go to for a frivolous massage you'd get at the Four Seasons spa; its for people who need pain relief from injuries or discomfort. I had sprained my lat at the gym and was prescribed anti-inflammatory medication by my doctor. By the third week I was still experiencing pain and stiffness, needless to say I was fed up. I decided to go to a sports injury therapist and found Matvey Kipershtein at YMT. After one session with him I was free of my pain. The next day I no longer had the pain or stiffness and within a couple days I was back at the gym.   Matvey is skilled, knowledgeable and honest. He knows his stuff and will answer any questions you have. There was never any pressure for follow up appointments and during my appointment there was never any feelings of a time constraint (as stated in the three star review).
4 Employer sent me here for a work physical.  I was in and out in 55 minutes.  MA and Doctor were friendly and helpful,  I would recommend this clinic.
1 There is a huge banner that says Family Medicine Walk-Ins Welcome but I've tried twice to walk in and they have been booked. They didn't even give me an option to wait and see if they could squeeze me in. If you need a walk in clinic this is for sure NOT the place to go. I guess it's just like a regular doctors office. You need to make an appointment. But, hopefully it won't be for the same day, because I tried calling for a same day appointment too. Too bad, it would have been great if it really was a walk in clinic. Try Dignity Health Urgent Care, they're great.
1 Been trying to find a primary care doctor and it is not easy. I tried this place out because it was close to my home. The appointment scheduler on their website wasn't working so I called in. Easy. Told them that I was looking to find a primary care doctor and so they wrote me in as establishing patient. Cool. I go to my appointment and the front desk ladies were very nice (best part of the visit). Wait time was within 10 minutes. Awesome. I thought I would get a physical and do a basic check up. NOT the case. As soon as Dr. Vazquez walked in and saw me, his first question was "How long have you been here from the Philippines?" I was confused and asked that he repeat himself. He sure did ask how long I've been in the states assuming I was born in another country. I told him I was born in Oklahoma. He asked what I was doing there and I told him I'm looking for a general practitioner. He said that he's an Internist and specializes in whatever fancy jargon he was spewing out. He said that he was not the doctor for me. I told him that I did not request him by name so not sure why they would pair me with a doctor who doesn't want to be my primary care physician. He was condescending and weird. Just so that I didn't completely waste my time, I told him that I had a cough due to allergies. He had some other lady come in and she gave me a shot. It was a very odd experience because she made me get up from my seat, walk to the middle of the room, stand in front of the door (where if someone was not careful, could have the door hit me if someone walked in). When I was done, no one told me how to get out of the back area. I had to ask and Dr Vazquez gave me a verbal general direction instead of someone walking me like I'm used to experiencing when I see a doctor or a dentist. I would only try that place out again if I could see another doctor.
5 I worked out my lats a little too much and was very sore. As a massage therapist myself my forearms, chest, and neck were also tight. I felt like I needed a DT massage but wasn't sure how much pressure I could handle, however I left my well being in my therapist's hands and Linzie was SPECTACULAR! She works slow, smooth, and deliberate. Releasing the muscle attachments and finally worked deep into the belly of the muscle. I am NOT sore after the massage and my muscles feel completely relaxed. 55 min was just enough for my glutes and upper body but a 110 min massage is sure to leave you drooling!
1 Had a sprain thumb that I had received from work, so I had to come get it checked out.  The wait was about 2 hours in the waiting room and an hour to see the doctor.  When the Dr. Finally comes to see me he grabs the wrong hand and says Oh yes it's sprained, so I told him it was the wrong hands then says the same.thing about that hand.  He says I have to do physical therapy, but I said I didn't want to it wasn't that serious just give me an ice pack.  I learn that I have to schedule a follow up for me to get cleared to work.  So when I scheduled my appointment originally for Tuesday I realized I couldn't come Tuesday, so I called to reschedule for Sunday at 9am and they said they would call for a reminder.  I get no call but am on my way so I decided to call them to make sure.  Turns out they tell me the lady who put it in put it for Saturday and told me I would have to wait 2 and a half hours! After I began to get frustrated they told me I can come in and get seen.  I come in and then they proceed to tell me I still have to wait less than 2 hours after a minute of arguing, they decide to let me go next.  This is definitely an unprofessional place, they need to do something about the staff and even doctors themselves!!
2 I have been a patient of Dr. Simo (physiotherapist) for over 2 years. He is a great doctor and I recommend him. That's the only reason why I give this clinic more than 1 star.  On the other hand, I had a very unpleasant and unprofessional experience with Dr. James (naturopath) in the initial appointment: - Poor time management that leaded to not being able to prescribe a treatment plan. - Unprofessional attitude. - Poor problem solving abilities. - Not enough experience and knowledge in the field. $160 for an appointment to talk about very little unimportant details about your life and see the doctor typing everything in the computer.  The only way to communicate with the management is through emails, and after a week, they haven't responded.  After been to this clinic so many times, I'm probably not coming back.
5 I cannot say enough good things about UMC. They saved my husband's life while we were on vacation in Las Vegas. The doctor's were skilled and knowledgable, and the nurses and staff were kind, informative, and helpful. They diagnosed my husband's blocked artery and quickly placed a stent in his heart. The procedure was smooth and everyone there was wonderful to both of us and my family throughout the entire process and his recovery. I hope to never need to go to UMC again, but if I ever need a hospital while in Las Vegas it would be my first choice.
1 Horrible customer service ... Ordered an item and called several days later to find out if it was shipped and was told it was on back order and that I should have received an e mail but they forgot to send it .. When I asked about the back order arrival  I was told they could not give me an answer .. The agent seemed like he could care less about my order and was basically like whatever ... I called back and cancelled my order and ordered from a reliable company like Amazon .. If I would have saw these reviews prior to ordering I defintely would not have bothered with this company ...
5 I have Psoriatic Arthritis, and I am usually in pain, mostly body pain, all the time. But, I work in a physical environment loading luggage for a major airliner, and I have back pain (Not associated with my Psoriatic Arthritis, I don't think) well, Chris knew about my condition, but treated me for my back. I can say, that I no longer have back pain now. He fixed me right up. And now, I just go back for routine maintenance when I feel it coming back (Psoriatic Arthritis related, or not)
1 Incompetence abounds!  I chose them because they are close to my home. One DR prescribed for me a Med I'm sensitive to, but my hubby prefers & prescribed for my hubby a Med that could kill him, but that I can safely take. (Obviously, he crossed our info). Another DR, in this group, had 2 hospital stays and a surgery performed on my elderly hubby... Because he misread a test result!
1 terrible, went for a physical and they forgot to give me all the paperwork to fill out so i had to drive all the way out there again just to fill out 2 and a half papers.  The staff is really rude too. This place is just a total train wreck. Two thumbs down, and the staff has zero accountability for things like this, extremely irritating.  Hope i never see them again.
5 Scott is AMAZING! I was referred to him by a co-worker when training for my 1st full marathon.  Scott is VERY knowledgable and extremely helpful for athletes training for an event- such as a marathon, triathlon, etc!  I was having a few complaints as far as soreness and pains and my massage with Scott really helped to clear up my issues!  I explained to him what was bothering me and he was able to thoroughly explain why I was experiencing these issues and what to do to help alleviate them.  I have just started training for my 2nd full marathon and will be seeing Scott more frequently to help my body during the grueling training.  I always look forward to my appointments with Scott and would NEVER go anywhere else in Vegas for a massage!
2 If you are in a hurry, forget about it at this place. That is all I can say.
1 Very unprofessional and rude staff. They were always either over charging me at my appointments or under charging me and months later telling me I owe them money. Wait times would typically be 1 to 2 hours after original appointment time. They were terrible at returning phone calls and never helpful when wanting to know information. That office is literally being run by people who don't know how to do there job and respect their patients. I've been going here for a few years and when I started the front desk lady Lupe was wonderful... after she left the place fell apart. They are running a shady and unprofessional business and I would definitely not recommend going here.
5 My go to for Standard Process Cleanse consultation and products. The SP 21 Day cleanse resets my body relieving me of joint pain, lethargy, and inflammation. Dr. Mack is an expert is whole body wellness.
2 Great massage.  But the reason I only give it two stars is because the aggressive relentless hard sales pitch every time I go there.  My wife is a member and transfers one massage every six months to me.  Everytime I go in they spend about ten minutes trying to get me to sign up for their membership.  Ruins the masssage  Yes I know about your freaking membership and no I don't want it.
2 I must agree with some of the other reviews here.  I've been a patient since 2010 and am currently looking for a new clinic.  This was a great practice when Dr. White actually would see his patients.  The PA's and nurses are not bad, but the staff just brings down the whole office.  I've waited three days to get a call back from a nurse, so something is lacking here.   After going to this office for over 7 years, I recently (6-21-17) had another disappointing experience when I went in for an animal bite.  Although I was able to get in, for which I am grateful, I was a little stressed about the bite. Even though their own records showed that I had a tetanus shot 6 years earlier, they indicated that I should get another one, so I did.  I did leave with a prescription for antibiotics, which is what I really needed.  The PA said they don't bill insurance because insurance won't pay, which I've found out from my insurance was 100% false.  When my insurance called to request that they bill it, they refused.  I appealed to them myself, and they would not budge, nor could I talk to a supervisor/manager.  I also found out I had a credit on my account, for which they had not refunded.  I had to pay out of pocket for the shot, and I billed the insurance myself.  Hassle.  After billing, I've now determined that insurance paid Ensign Med. I am in the process of trying to get refunded since they've been double-paid.    I was also told I could not talk to billing: they're in Texas.  However, I was recently contacted by a Linda Sutton, whom I assume is local.  Not sure where she is, but I cannot seem to communicate with her by phone. I'm attempting to get my billing ledger, but so far, no go. She seems to be way behind on her emails.  It may not be their fault, but the system there seems to be not working for the patient.      The sad part is: They just don't seem to care.  It's time to find another Physician that's interested in connecting with and retaining patients.  I'm sure it's tough these days on the Physician's trying to keep up with the ACA, but I expect more from my Doc.  Update:  I went down and talked to the front desk, and the woman was somewhat cooperative.  I did get me ledger going back to 2011.  I've done a lot of auditing in my day, but had trouble following it.  Seems it might be that way by design.  I was told again billing is in Texas.  As for my refund, Dr. White has to cut the check, and he's out until next week.
5 Dr. Jonathan Hackenyos.   I am a senior citizen who discovered Dr. Hackenyos a couple of years ago.  He is fantastic.   Very relational as well as a superb doctor.  Highly recommend his office and services.
1 My experience with this place has been terrible! I got an appointment fast and the wait time was pretty quick. (They got me in before I could finish filling out my new patient paperwork) The nurse and the doctor were great when I was there...but after I left it was all downhill.  I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism. (Kind of?) They had me do blood work and then called me back with the results and told me they were going to do more testing. (Didn't tell me I needed to make another appointment; so I assumed they were testing the blood samples they already had for further things) A week later I called for the results and was told I needed to contact Quest and schedule an appointment. Once I got in at Quest, they told me the SWMA didn't send over any of my insurance information, so they were going to bill me full price ($400) and that if I wanted my insurance information put in for the blood work that I would have to contact SWMA. (Which it's been about two weeks and I'm still getting the run around on that one...)  They also suggested I see a nutritionist and put in an order for some x-ray's for me. The doctor told me he had sent in the request for both at places my insurance was accepted. I went to get my x-ray's at the Sienna Height's location and they told me I couldn't get an x-ray because my insurance isn't accepted there and that the electronic request sent by my doctor wouldn't be enough anyway, that I would need a written request. Called SWMA again and they didn't believe me when I told them I was denied and had to call them to see why. Still waiting for them to send me somewhere that actually takes my insurance...  Then I tried the nutritionist. Of course they don't take my insurance, either, even though the doctor said they did. I found a nutritionist in my network and had them submit a request for my doctors referral. Got a call two days later from one of the assistants as SWMA telling me the doctor denied my request because he only sends people to the one place he sent me before that doesn't accept my insurance...I explained this to them and supposedly he wrote my letter after I called about it twice, but still hasn't sent it.  Even when my final blood test came back, they still didn't really explain what was going on. Originally they told me I definitely had hypothyroidism, then on the follow up call the nurse told me that I'm on the cusp of having it, so they are giving me meds to maintain. I asked if I needed a follow up appointment to check on the meds after so long and they said no. My pharmacist, another doctor and all of my friends who have the same condition said you go after 6 weeks of originally starting the meds, and then every 6 months once they find a stable medication for you.   Basically ALL of the information they've given me has been wrong. It's been weeks of me wanting to fix a problem and not being able to get any help or answers from SWMA at all. Plus, I have never had a doctor not be the one to follow up with me on test results if there is something wrong. I think it's a little weird that the nurse calls me, and then has to call me back the next day to tell me what the doctor said if I have any questions.  Needless to say, I'm going to a different doctor for now on by recommendation of a friend. Hopefully getting my files transfered over isn't as big of a pain in the ass as everything else has been with them.
5 Shane is great.  His staff is wonderful.  Always greeted with a sunny smile from Kat.  Everyone is helpful and attentive to your needs - even when they fluctuate from session to session.  They are helping me strengthen my lower back to continue to remain mobile through arthritis.  After my experience there I am now taking my elderly Mother for physical therapy with Shane and the rest in hopes she will regain some strength, gain balance, and attain the posture she desperately wants to have back.
3 I've been coming to this location for a while and have always been happy. I've seen Dr. Liu and Dr. Otten and during that time I was so pleased with my experiences from start to finish. But it seems they have expanded and things have changed. I am now seeing Dr. Kuruvali and I'm not super happy.   The nurse I saw was incredibly rude. She would ask me questions and then interrupt my answers. She walked out of the room while I was talking. When it was found I needed a brace for my ankle she didn't even try and show me how to put it on correctly or anything. She slapped in on and started to leave. I had to ask her to show me how it went on.   The front desk staff has gotten super rude as well. I called today because I need approval from my insurance for an MRI. It has been over a week since my visit and they just submitted the request yesterday. Meanwhile I'm walking around with a very uncomfortable brace and a torn tendon. When I expressed my displeasure, she hung up on me.   The ONLY reason I will give this place 3 stars is because Dr. Liu and Dr. Otten are wonderful.. Nice, understanding, and patient. I did feel that this doctor, Kuruvali, was VERY rushed though.  I am seriously considering going elsewhere for this issue.
5 Tremendously efficient staff, friendly physicians and a pharmacy right in house. I was in and out in an hour in the middle of flu season. A great asset to downtown residents!
5 You know that feeling you get when you know the decision you made was the right one...   That's how I felt on my first visit to Dr.Perez's office. I called right at 8:00 and Tara picked up the phone and said that I could come in right now. I was taken back for a second because you usually can't get in the day of the call. As soon as I arrived I had to fill out new patient paperwork and I was seen by the doctor in minutes. Dr.Perez shook my hand and listened to everything I said and diagnosed me. We chatted for several minutes after about this and that. They also called in my prescription which was a nice touch. Everything was very clean and the entire staff was very professional and nice. GREAT EXPERIENCE!!!
1 This practice has no idea what they are doing and from the impression I received from the six people I encountered during my two visits to this awful office, they are truly incompetent.   My first visit I scheduled an appointment because I was sick, exhausted, and hadn't been myself for about two weeks. The doctor told me my body was just 'catching up' and had no advice to offer me or medication to prescribe. So I continued to be sick for another two weeks. Her only solution was for me to get my blood drawn to see if anything abnormal was revealed.   I never received the results of the lab tests, so when I called two weeks later to inquire about them, there was no 'message' on the voice mail for my patient ID. I called the front desk to ask about it, and she said the doctor's assistant would call me back. The next day she left a message saying 'we need to setup a time to go over your lab results.' I called back shortly after, and the assistant was already gone (Thursday afternoon) and wouldn't be back until Monday.  She never called me back, and I called two more times to get some answer and I never received any information or a call back from the 'doctor's assistant.'  The doctor wanted to scheduled a follow-up the next time I was in town, which took place today. After talking to me for 2 minutes, the doctor (a different one from the first time I went) abruptly examined me and then sent her assistant in to tell me I couldn't receive the Depo Provera shot I was scheduled for (a form of birth control taken every three months) and then wouldn't give me any alternate prescription for birth control because she was in a hurry to leave the office.   My dad is a patient there, and instead of receiving the flu shot he was supposed to, they "accidentally" gave him the Gardasil shot, which is one of a series of shots to prevent certain forms of HPV in WOMEN.   I will never go back there again, and I strongly advise you not to- unless you want the worse service you can pay for. Huge waste of time and money, and now I am back at square one.
5 This place is amazing. They are always super fast and efficient and their office is always clean. I've been here twice now and both times the staff was very friendly. I like that they do x-rays on-site and always have a tech available. Also, the last time I visited, I was prescribed an antibiotic and they had the prescription on hand so I was able to receive and pay for it right at the office. No waiting or trips to the pharmacy.
3 I love the 90+ minute deep-tissue and myofascial release therapy massages here!  I tried chiropractic therapy years ago; my favorite component of my visits then were the massages.  Before I visited this facility, I asked if I could just get massages there, and while my question seemed out of the ordinary, I was able to get a positive confirmation!  There's a private room where you'll find the massage table, the therapist's chair, a couple of racks to hang your clothes on, a fan, and cd player with a few music styles to choose from.  Noise from outside the room can get loud (and thus distracting) depending on office traffic- I wish they'd soundproof the walls (more than) a bit.  BTW, my insurance company turned down my claims for reimbursal for services rendered here...
5 Dr. Balzer has been extremely through from the start of my initial evaluation to my follow up treatments. He was able to really help me stop the numbness and tingling I was experiencing down into my hand and I can now wag my hair without symptoms!   The entire staff was extremely friendly and could truly feel everyone cared. I loved my exercises the most as they matched my fitness level. Thank you Impact Team for a wonderful experience!
2 I wasn't really impressed with this center. After I gave my email to receive patient paperwork, I have since received an annoying number of what I consider spam emails.   While at the center, everyone seemed pretty relaxed and easy going but our therapist seemed pretty disinterested.  She was talking about orthotic insoles and how they would help speed up recovery; we asked if the husband could wear them in dress shoes, and she pretty much said he couldn't. Once we told her that buying custom made orthotic (ranging from $200 to $400 a piece) was probably not a good investment since all he wears is dress shoes, she proceeded to say first that they help even if you don't wear them all the time (whaaaaat) and secondly that they could "trim" the front of the sole, although during the foot scan she pointed out how all the weight was place on the front of the foot. Seriously?  Moving on, we started the "therapy session" that lasted less than 20 minutes - she wasn't paying attention, she wasn't correcting my husband form or posture and she wasn't even instructing him correctly.   My husband tried to get her attention and asked her "should I stretch both legs?" to which she responded "oh yeah right for symmetry". Well, why don't you pay attention so your patient knows what to do and is not left guessing?  To me, this felt too much like a "massage envy" for physical therapy - all patients are in the same big, run down room and therapist chit chat among each other about their own personal matters.   Nah thanks bye
1 Suuuuper slow.  Waaaay expensive co-pays.  This place is a joke.  I have been sitting in their waiting room for 90 minutes and they are telling me it will be another 15 minutes before I even see a doctor.  I can hear their staff of young delinquents laughing and yelling at each other in spanish through the walls.  Save yourself the headache and avoid this place like the plague.  There are so many other better urgent care offices within 2 or 3 miles of this dump.
5 My husband and I just experienced our 1st float and highly recommend it! So relaxing, totally weightless feeling! The spa was super clean and the owner was especially welcoming and super friendly. It was definitely something different and cool. Would make a super original gift!
1 Tried 6 times to get an appointment with this facility as I have a terminal illness I desperately need treated and all 6 times I was told there was nothing available and to call back tomorrow. Absolute worst medical facility I have ever dealt with, they have absolutely no compassion for their patients.
4 I've been here three times now. The first was for a basics crystals class which was honestly so amazing. I learned so much and only wish to gain more knowledge. Tammi has such positive energy. I've also received two holy reiki crystal chakra balance sessions. The first session was so powerful. I could feel the room full of energy and she helped release so much negative I was carrying. She was thorough and explained the whole process to me and also explained everything that happened and what I can do in taking steps towards my happiness and inner peace. The second session was also wonderful and I also felt a huge release. The reason I didn't give the whole 5 stars is during the second session there was a couple interruptions from customers and so she had to leave the room to attend to them. She did apologize and extend my session because of this but it was difficult for me to feel relaxed and focus as I felt some energy diverted but I'm also understanding and Tammi truly does her best for me as for those coming into her shop to ask questions or look at all the wonderful crystals, candles and oils she has in house. All in all I can't Wait to return. I've never felt myself with such ease and surrounded by so much light and love
5 A nice and clean facility with friendly staff.  Dr. Simi VanCise is our family doctor and I have seen her on a few occasions.  On each visit, the wait time was minimal and I was promptly taken back for a quick weigh-in/bp check and escorted to the room where again, the wait time was minimal before Dr. VanCise came to see me.  She listens, informs and you can tell is genuinely concerned for her patient's well being.  I am very surprised by the good care in these days of driving cattle through the typical health care facility.  Thumbs up!
5 Have been taking my mother here for amost a year. We have been treated very well. They speak in simple terms, easy to understand. They listen to her about her aches & pains.  The staff, both front and back office, are very friendly. Have always seen Janell. She is very knowledgeable & frindly. Great sense of humor.  I would recommend Sundance to anyone looking for a doctor.
4 Great staff. Specializes on weaning tracheotomy. Nurses are sweet, caring, accommodating, and best of all it's in the St. Rose De Lima campus, which means all the doctors that were treating him at the Sienna Campus are here too.
5 I have been going to Dr.Christopher for the past few weeks and couldn't be happier. My pain is getting better and better with each visit. They listen to everything you have to say and target your pain areas everytime. They have a very open and flexible schedule and the front desk staff is very accommodating. All of the staff that has worked on me have been friendly and attentive. I'm so happy that I choose to come to this office it has been nothing but a pleasure. The office is always clean and always has clean bathrooms too. I had to bring the kiddos with me for one appointment and they were so sweet and so helpful. They brought them coloring books and answered their 100 questions about all the equipment. Thank you guys for making every visit great.
1 This is a terrible physical therapy clinic.  I recommend to look for other clinics if you are assigned to attend here.  The employees are EXTREMELY unprofessional.  One physical therapist acted like I was interrupting his daily routine of doing nothing when I asked if I was doing an exercise correctly.  While he was aligning my hips, he stared blankly at the front door, the ceiling, the visions in his head....  Only concern that seemed to emanate from him was when a good looking patient walked by to the exercise floor.  I was in more pain after I left upwards to 3 days after I left, and this wasn't from working on muscles that have weakened.  It was from lazy employees who could care less about their patients unless they are good looking or have connections.  God forbid if you are a disabled veteran trying to become independent.
5 I had severe knee pain after my pregnancy, so bad that it was hard to walk up and down stairs and was greatly impacting my mobility. Mike did a marvellous job at getting me back to normal in 3 visits! I feel like myself again and I owe him a huge debt of gratitude. Thank you! He is a lifesaver. Pain is now gone. It's miraculous!
1 1.DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THEIR 14 DAY FREE TRIAL. Enable for you to get it you must sign-up with them and become their member.  2.The membership cost which is around $50-60 per month is not worth it because the gym is quite small.   3. I complained about their sales representative and the manager will only tell you to pay 75% of the contract if you want to cancel.   4. Do not give any of your family members or friends info to them, because they will pursue them to join.
5 Basic Healing is by far the best Physical Therapy clinic in the Las Vegas/Henderson area. Larry really cares about getting his patients to feel better. I might even say he has Magic Hands, because whatever muscular pain I had when I walked into the clinic was gone by the time I left.
5 BEST PLACE TO GO!!! In this difficult climate of trying to navigate one's health care, this location couldn't be more helpful. Every question I have had, has been promptly answered and the doctor's expertise knowledge in directing  me to exactly to what I need and what I was inquiring about has been a God send!   Thank you for your great advise on the Bvitamin boosters and the wonderful (and truly affordable) packages you have!   I'd give you a million stars if I could!!!!
4 I went to two sessions of Hydrocolonic theraphy and so far I am very happy with the results. The first time I went back home with a "trauma" because the process was uncomfortable, but the day after I felt to clean inside that I could barely believe it. I went for my second session a week after and it went much better. All the residues were gone and it was painless. I would ever swear that I lost an inch in my belly, and I am already thin. I will schedule my third appointment soon, since I feel my levels of energy down with the winter. I know it may look scary at first but once you have tried this, you will do it every season for the rest of your life. The feeling afterwards is addictive.
5 The staff here are wonderful. My sister goes here, and they are so patient with her. She is mentally handicapped and very afraid to go, but they are undaunted by her resistance to receiving the therapy.
1 Not one other patient was in the lobby and I sat in the office for literally over 30 minutes before they asked me to fill out paperwork. Took an extra 40 minutes for me to be taken back for my urinalysis and TB test. Definitely do not recommend. Employees pay no attention to time or amount of people in waiting room.
5 Unfortunately, I have had quite a few sports related injuries over the years that required surgery and physical therapy to fully recover.  While I had good therapists, the clinics I visited were large and crowded and I often found myself spending over two hours waiting around to get 50 minutes of treatment.  Anyone that has been to a large clinic can relate to how frustrating it is to stand around waiting to do your exercises. I often thought, why am I paying for this, I can do this at home.   The point of telling you this is Chandler Physical Therapy is just the opposite.  My appointment always starts on time and the office environment ensures that you are always getting the attention need and deserve.  Even after the therapists have worked with you they are able to see every exercise you are doing and provide feedback.  Both PT assistants are also great and they are never more than a few feet away; so you won't spend your time waiting to see what exercise to do next or do something wrong and further injure yourself.    The owner Eric makes sure the clinic is fun, yet professional... so it is a great atmosphere. Everyone there will know your name an make you feel welcome.   As for results, I went in for a lower back issue (I could not sit for more than a few minutes without pain) and managed to resolve a old running injury at the same time.   After one treatment that included dry needling, my back felt better than that it had in weeks.  While I was getting treatment on my back I mentioned to Danny (one of the PTs) that I had a bad hamstring I spent several years rehabbing but it never got better, which took a major toll on my running.  I had tried everything including standard PT, ASTYM, ART, and visits to multiple ortho docs (they just said stop running) and nothing worked.  Danny offered to dry needle my hamstring and he very next day it was 80% better than it had been in two years.   Long story short I am back running and already setting new PRs,  even though I am getting older.   I have worked with Eric and Danny and they are both great. I have also recommended them to a friend who had a nagging injury and he thanks me regularly for the referral as he is also back running at full strength after working with Danny.  My advice... skip the large corporate clinics and give this family owned clinic a try.  I think you will be very happy you did....   Scott
5 This is definitely  one of my favorite places to go right now!! Everyone here makes you feel like home. So friendly and approachable! Liz is definitely my girl in here! She makes it seem like we been friends forever. Love the fact that there is no awkwardness or tension when you walk right in. If you ever need some place to be pampered I say definitely  come here!! My happy place!
5 Dr Kuty is awesome! She has a clean office, and friendly staff. I come in stiff and achy and leave feeling energized and comfortable.  I recommend her to all my family and friends looking for relief!
5 Being a first time mother and having to choose the right pediatrician was definitely something I was big on. The next day after I went into labor , Dr Delgado came in and introduced her self to me, and gave me insight on her location.  My son was born with jaundice and I was of course freaked out about it . But Tri Star got me set up over the phone with an appointment while in the hospital. After checking out the hospital and going the following day to Tri star for my appointment , Delgado was so helpful and gave me all the resources I needed!  My son is now going on two and I have still been coming here ever since. Delgado always explains what shots are going to be given, side effects, after care and so on! Delgado hears you out , answers all you're questions , no matter how crazy they may be!  Delgado is friendly and makes you feel welcomed, along with the front desk and staff in the back! I wish I remembered her name but she is the main assistant who gives the shots, well anyways I think she's amazing and warm hearted , and also fast when it comes to the needles!
1 You do not want to do business with this company under any circumstances.  After having back surgery, I was referred to these people for PT.  After only three visits, they put a medical lean on my house demanding payment.  I had not even finished evaluation by them.    I have Medicare and Humana part B.  Yet. These greedy people in less than a month blindsided me with this.  If this is an indication of how they treat their patients, you need to look elsewhere for PT.  I requested an exercise regimen which i feel they also fell short on.
1 I've disliked this place from my first appointment but continued to give more chances. I've seen Eric, Dr. Williams-Vaughan, and Martha. All of them are not personable at all. I am always uncomfortable talking to them. It also seems like they just run pointless tests, probably to get more insurance money.  Martha continually said she didn't want to seem pushy but was one of the most pushy people I've met. Even the office staff is not friendly. The only good person there is Andre, the medical assistant. Anyways save your time and money and find a different primary care.
5 My husband and I had been clients of Dr. Day for  more than 3 years now. We go to his office for wellness and spine adjustments. My migraine was minimized and learned to manage it with Dr. Day's help with the treatment and to avoid the triggers. We recommend Dr Day to our friends and family!
5 Dr. Rosenstein was extremely helpful and knowledgeable. I had an appt at 1 pm and arrived at 12:45. I was seen at 1 pm and my concerns were addressed adequately. He answered all my questions and provided substantial feedback for my concerns. He took the time to make me feel comfortable and well informed. I can't remember  his assistance name but she was great as well, very nice and friendly.
4 Sharon was amazing! Very skilled therapist. I will definitely ask for her next time I'm in town.
5 Dr. Shelly is by far the best doctor I have ever had.  I have a very long history with bad doctors and up until recently I had given up on finding one altogether.  I feel like she has my best interests in mind no matter what I am going through or coming to her for.  The entire staff is super friendly and I cant Imagine going anywhere else.
1 This is what happened when they drew my blood.  See attached picture. The woman who did it obviously didn't know what she was doing and blew the vein.
5 This office is amazing! Great staff and so many options of care. Everything from specialized Chiropractic, to Physical Therapy. They also have one of the best Sports med/Rehab Doc in AZ. I would def recommend seeing any of AZ Spine's providers!!!
1 So disappointed.  When they first opened they boasted they were an urgent care facility. One weekend my husband was very ill and he went to what he thought was an urgent care. He was told that he had to switch his primary care doc to their office or they wouldn't see him. He said he was looking for urgent care services because it was a weekend and he was sick. They refused to see him unless he completed the doc change.  Needless to say he never went back.
5 Dr. Paster is simply the best. I lost my job and my Deancare insurance, but I still go to him anyway and pay out of pocket -- because he's that good!
5 I've been coming to this gym quite very often and since then after a long day, it's always nice to be greeted with a friendly face and a warm smile that says "Let's forget about todays worries and pump out the negatives."  Of course, I'm being optimistic only because the staffing here has been just fantastic and overall very personable.  One honorable mention whose been kind to me, Libi, and let me tell you you'll never find a more spunky, vivacious person than this one right here. Everytime I walk between those double doors, she'll greet with you a welcoming smile and it always feels nice to meet someone whose genuinely kindhearted. Look out for her! She'll no doubt go far beyond to make sure you're satisfied with your gym experience!   A gentleman named Casey Smith is a sight for sore eyes. He's empowering, cultivating, and even if he doesn't know it; works just as hard as most power lifters in here. I've come to know him for a while and he will no doubt give you friendly tips when you stop and ask him. He is there to lend a hand and lift your spirits, so it is great to see people like him to be an role model for these athletes.  For all the staff that I was fortunate to meet have been courteous and will lend you a helping hand if ever you need assistance. Keep up the good work guys! A warm, friendly greeting can go a loong way for great customer service.
5 I am very critical when I make reviews and wanted to wait until a few visits to make my conclusions. My personal experience with Dr Canavan and his staff has been exceptional. He pays attention to your complaints of pain and helps to resolve it. I am heading to my 4th visit and impressed at my decreased level of back and hip pain. We are surely on our way to pain management and long term resolutions. It's the best feeling I have had in months.
1 This is probably the worst doctor's office in the state!  My doctor, who I had been seeing for several years, ended up merging her practice with this place.  After a year or so, my doctor retired and moved out of the state.  I was given no notice, no warning, no nothing.  I was "assigned" to another doctor, who I ended up seeing for about a year or two.  He has now left this place and I was given no warning, no notice, no nothing, AGAIN!  In the meantime, the staff here doesn't return phone calls, they won't refill a prescription by fax/email, they won't call the pharmacy back and they won't refill ANYTHING unless you go in for a doctor visit every 3 months.  What a scam!!  I've been taking a prescription for more than 15 yrs and they won't refill it unless I go see a doctor there who doesn't know me, who knows nothing about me and wants to hear me breathe 3 times so they can collect the insurance payment.  I highly recommend you NEVER go here for any reason.
3 I did some research before going to see Dr William Riley and he came across as being recommend. Dr Riley was personable and approachable. Appointments were easy to schedule on the phone. Dr Riley himself responded to message though the patient portal. In addition to time to help me with leave of absence paperwork my employer had requested. I would recommend Dr Riley for diabetic and high blood pressure care but take time to double check before leaving the office for any medical records sent or received, copies of referral doctor information, and copies of prescription(s) and ask for a printed itemized bill before paying any previous doctor visit bills at the front desk.
1 If I could give 0 stars I would. I contacted Tempe St. Luke's Business Department (602) 797-7300. Spoke to Yesenda and co-worker who refused to give her name. I have never been spoken to so disrespectfully in my entire life. There was no customer service. They gave me wrong information in regards to my account. This hospital should be ashamed of itself. Needs detrimental improvements in their hiring policies.
5 Kim Titus office manager for Dr Cunninghams office is the most caring and considerate person.  She goes over and above to assist members.  She will open up an appointment for a member in need to make sure they are taken care of that day. I have very high regards for the way she runs Dr Cunninghams office. She treats everyone with respect and consideration. S-
2 I've been going here for years and I was just recently disabled and forced to use Medicaid. At this point I was treated like some second rate citizen. Due to my condition I don't feel safe driving and there were a few times I had to reschedule my appointments and in a few occasions I missed appointments due to hospitalization and they counted all of those as no shows and dismissed me from the practice. Don't go here if you have Medicaid or Medicare as they will not treat you like a human
3 Excellent service, very friendly staff and amazing instructors. Do note that most of the people at this gym are very fit and already in shape.
1 Purposely over booking so your patients have to wait an hour past there appointment time is a horrible practice. This place has no concern for there patients. I won't be back.
2 Took my family here for vaccines and medication for an upcoming trip.  We made an appointment. Well apparently that didn't matter because we ended up waiting 2 hours just to see the doctor. Then we had to wait another half hour for the vaccines.   The doctor was nice when we finally saw him. Gave us good information for our trip. Good news is we didn't get sick on the trip!   We had another trip planned recently and decided to come back for a prescription for some more medication.  Again we made an appointment, perhaps it was an anomaly last time for having to wait so long. Nope. It was 2 hours again.   It took them about 20 minutes to find my husbands file alone. Apparently it was misfiled.    And this time what really frustrated me was that some people just walked in with no appointment and were seen first. My guess is because they were paying for their consultation were as we were just going for a prescription.   Completely frustrating experience - next time I may try another clinic because this one clearly is understaffed and disorganized.
1 Only giving them 1 star because you cannot give anything less. THE WHOLE STAFF WAS RUDE! Doctors stuck my girlfriend 5 times trying to do a spinal tap. The staff was more concerned about whether there Facebook was up to date or if the consent form signed to do spinal tap. The ALSO BREACHED THE HIPA LAWS!! My girlfriend needed to go back to hospital and we passed them to drive 5 miles out of the way to go to BANNER!! I RECOMMEND EVERYONE STAY WAY FRON THIS GARBAGE HOSPITAL IF YOU CALL IT THAT!!
5 I highly recommend Cornerstone Physiotherapy.  They have a wonderful, dedicated and caring staff.   I began my treatment with Jodi Arnott BScKin, MScPT near the end of November and the results have been incredible.    They are conveniently located beside St Andrew's station and office hours are great.
4 After a bad ankle sprain, Cedric was a saving grace. He was helpful and attentive to all of my questions and concerns. I'm back up and running, all thanks to the wonderful team at Cornerstone Physiotherapy.
1 I called here about my billing because my debit card was stolen so I had it replaced and a guy that works in graveyard had told me to bring proof from my bank saying that my debit card was stolen to waive the $25 fee they had me pay so I did. The next day I come here and Elizabeth (the girl in the front desk) looks overly annoyed of me and I'm asking to speak to the manager about my billing and all she gives me is a number to call about my billing and don't even bother to get the manager for me and have me wait while helping other customers and when I called the number she gave me call, all it was is a machine talking to me about my payments I had recently did. So unprofessional here, I thought they could do better than LVAC but I thought wrong.
5 Craig Horton Sr. -- Dr Fabito is a very caring, easy to talk to compassionate guy.. Yea, his a Doctor, but he really care about your pain issues and wanted to help you find the best way to deal with it.. I was at the end of my rope, tire of other doctors drug pushing treatments with no real results.. Until now... I was referred to Dr Fabito by some of the nest Neurologists in the southwest.. and it here that I learned of this newly FDA approved procedure by Nevro.. here is my story below, I stand by every word as this is LIFE CHANGING ..    I am sure that you or know many people around you in moderate to very bad back pain, I want to spread the word on this wonderful new product, The Nevro HF10 Back Stimulator.. Unfortunately there are on a few doctors in the USA that perform this procedure and I want to let everyone I know in Florida and here in Nevada just who he is.. Dr Daniel Fabito here in Henderson/ Las Vegas, Nevada. It is my hope you share this post with others, its life changing..    I am just amazed that this gave me my "Normal walking mobility" Back..    I have needed major L4/5 S/1 surgery for over 5 years but unable to get surgery due to major cardiac risks. Straddled with prescription drugs, I was required to use a scooter to do most everything outside the house, go to mail box, take garbage to street, any kind of shopping or sightseeing and I could not walk more than 20' or play pool anymore..    This was a simple out patient trial to see first if it would work for me. Later that night at home, I got up and realized I was different and went to bed. The Mornings are the worst, so the next morning, I moved slow as usual, then I rolled out of bed and stood up, with NO PAIN AT ALL..I yelled to my wife, Honey no pain.. I found myself walking like I used to and realized I didnt have to be so cautious.. it was ok to stand all the way up and step out, didnt have to hold my breath!! WOW.. So I decided to test it.. Later in the day I went to Walmart, walked from my handicap parking spot grabbed a basket and shopped for 3 hours on my own 2 feet without the need to sit down !....   I was in tears.. Some employees that had seen me on my scooter for years, were shocked and asked if I was ok? where was the scooter.. I told them about this miracle..    Now for many reading this without sever back pain, you will have no idea what Im talking about or the relief it was to do just the simple things like walking without pain.. standing without pain..I might even sound silly..I am a 58 year old retired Space Shuttle program engineer, No one asked me to do this, I think this needs to go Viral and tell my story for YOU.. I am just amazed, as I never thought i would feel this normal again.. Scooter is going to be sold..    Please, I incourage anyone that has or knows someone with bad back pain to look up this procedure and this doctor here in Vegas.. maybe a short medical vacation is in store.. please feel free to contact me at anytime about this..
5 I injured my right shoulder golfing last year and medication and physical therapy fixed it. when I did the same to my left shoulder this year, the same treatment didn't have the same results. so I found optimal on google and tried it. Voila! I'm on the road to healing! And the therapists and staff made me feel cared for, respected and important. Thanks Optimal!
5 Today was my first visit to meet my new primary physician Dr Dawn. I was thoroughly impressed with the entire operation. It's great to have the peace of mind that they afforded me.
1 This clinic is useless! Not only did I waste my money and time but the triage "nurse" Richard was rude and sarcastic! And the Dr. I saw, Dr. Lim was useless and prescribed me an over the counter medication I had already tried!?! Why bother going? Will never come back to this place!
1 I did a lot of research and read reviews before deciding to schedule an appointment with this office (just needed a yearly physical exam).  I called on Monday at 9:30 and a sort of rude 'girl' took my name and number and said 'someone will for sure call you back today.'  I thought it was weird that someone would have to call me back to schedule an appointment.  Well, no one called me back.  I called again today (Tuesday) and I said I called yesterday and no one called me back.  Her response "Oh, what's your insurance?"  I told her before I gave her that info that I wanted to know if it was common practice to have to call someone back to schedule an appointment and she told me if I called at lunch time that it was.  I told her what time I called and she again said "Oh, what's your insurance?"  Uh, definitely not scheduling anything with this office-I'm sure the doctor's are great, but they need to get their front office in check.  I hate dealing with rude, inept people, especially where my health care is concerned.
5 This is the best chiropractic place I have ever been to. The staff is wonderful and friendly they go above and beyond patient needs! The cleanest by far for sure! They really know what they are doing here. I walked in slouched and hurting, then that's when I got all of the paperwork done, and the employees at the front desk are awesome!!! They have the best equipment there. They explain exactly what they are doing which I love. By the time I walked out I felt like I knew everyone! They told me I have 2 herniated disks and a unaligned spine, but before I could freak out they explained exactly what we were going to do and calmed me down. We started and I walked out actually standing up straight! Top notch professionals here I highly recommend to everyone!
1 Injured my right knee 3 years ago at which time the ortho advised me that I am at risk of the same injury on the left knee. 4 months ago I injured my LEFT knee and I'm given an Xray but needed an MRI. Nurse Collander decided I did not need one. My son comes in with a similar injury and he gets an MRI order the SAME day..My knee is still swollen. She LITERALLY SAW ME SECONDS NURSE AFTER SHE SAW HIM..Collander actually started discussing the COST of an MRI like shes paying for it or something . When I'm done complaining to every medical board, and all over social media I'll get a 2nd opinion from an office that actually CARESMORE..hopefully things work out for my son. Stay away from this place..like the lottery, maybe you will get lucky..
5 I am 5 months pregnant with my first child and have been going to Dr Jazz  to treat back and neck pain/pressure issues due to the extra pregnancy weight. She is absolutely FANTASTIC!! Dr Jazz is very knowledgable and has such a caring touch. Her staff is extremely welcoming and would highly recommend her practice to anyone!
4 I love this studio. After a year of weekly classes here I'm finally out of my membership allotment and I'm fairly sad about it. Each class was different and each instructor had their own flair but the one thing that stayed the same was the welcome attitude and the encouragement. It's truly a great place. However, the classes were a gift, and now that I'm faced with paying for it myself I'm struck by how expensive it is...I'm sure it's due to electricity costs and such but still...I wish they had more options to make it easier for people to afford.
5 Great customer service they don't oversell their service and they are very informative about the kind of massage that would be most beneficial for you. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a good acupuncture spot!
5 They continue to be awesome, even when my bonehead self forgets an appointment. D'oh! Very understanding and willing to work with you on rescheduling!
5 I'm new to Bikram, so forgive me if this is a biased review, but I really don't think that people reviewing this studio understand what Bikram is about. LOCK YOUR KNEE.  Bikram is a torture chamber in high heat and high humidity. No talking. Lock your knee. You have no knee. (They're getting in my brain).  That's the point. It's not "hot yoga" where you're doing yoga poses with the instructor and everything is flow-y and nice and happy and sweet. It's hard. You have to focus on your own postures and poses and listening to the words and following to get the right form. LOCK YOUR KNEE.  All that being said, I have been going for a week. Tonight will be my sixth class. I'm signing up for more. Because I like to be tortured. Because the staff/instructors at this studio are friendly, helpful, and they know my name (THEY KNOW MY NAME and I've only been going for one week!). LOCK YOUR KNEE.  The practice room itself, to me, had a funky smell on my first day. I got used to it. Despite the heat and humidity, you can feel the air moving in the room and it's not stuffy. It's easy to breathe. The heat becomes comfortable. The instructors do come around and help with form (they've all spent some time with me!) LOCK YOUR KNEE.  The studio offers $2 rentals for towels and mats, but I think that's gross even though they clean them so I bring my own. I just don't want to share sweat with someone else, no matter how clean the mat or towels might be. LOCK YOUR KNEE. This is good for someone who wants to try Bikram out without committing to buying a mat or yoga towel (I just use regular bath towels). They also have a really nice change room, separate recycling and trash containers, Smart Water and Vita Coco for sale, and I got a "I Survived My First Bikram Class" pin when I survived my first class. LOCK YOUR KNEE.  All in all, I loved this place, I love Bikram, and I love it so much that I'm actually redoing my budget to afford this (it IS expensive, but I realized if I quit drinking so many beers and so much coffee, I can afford it AND I'll be healthier in general).   Last chance everyone, LOCK YOUR KNEE. And get over to BYT.
5 Because of Austin, my posture has improved dramatically. He has created and gone over custom-designed training routines to specifically improve my posture which have unexpectedly helped me look and feel more confident as well. He also has access to an excellent network of other specialists which has been very useful.
5 I'm not sure how I was referred to the Mettler Center after a serious wrist fracture, but however it happened, I can assuredly say: Mettler Therapy is as good as it gets.   After a broken wrist injury, Jeff Schroder spent countless hours rehabilitating and strengthening my entire arm - which had not only atrophied due to the immobilization during healing, but was also laced with scar tissue.  That was back in 2002.  Almost 10 years later my wrist still has FULL RANGE OF MOTION. I have honestly not had one single recurring pain after completing my detailed PT program at the Mettler Center, and owe it all to the talents of the founder and his team of therapists, and the brilliant Mettler Release Technique.  Pain free full range of motion is important to anyone who has experienced an injury, but as a piano player, it is even more so!   Jeff, you probably don't remember me, but I will always remember you for your dedication and honest concern for my well being, and for helping to restore my wrist to as good as new condition!  Many thanks!
5 I have been going to this location for pain management for over a year now. I've seen several providers and I've been pleased with all of them. I see Daltrey for medication management, Dr. Pico for procedures, and Dr. Moore for chiropractic care. I've also seen Dr. Kibler for chiropractic care and acupuncture, however she has moved to the Glendale location. The front desk, billing, and assistant staff has been great as well.
5 Great place, good location, amazing staff. I had pain and they helped fix it and prevent it.  If you are needing a place go here.
5 Best family practice I have ever see!.  I have a lot of medical issues and Dr. Horrocks and Rachel Carney his PA are incredible.  I usually see Rachel.  She is like talking with a friend.  She is very thorough with my exams every time I see her.  She found my thyroid cancer and my husband's skin cancer.  She is incredible and I tell everyone I meet to go see her.  She is really good at sending you emails about any test or scans you get as soon as she gets them.  She also sends you the results that she get from other doctors.  I can't say enough about her, she is wonderful.  I have also seen Dr. Horrocks and he is really good about listening to your needs and talking to you about anything you need.  Neither one of them talk down to you or treat you like a number.  The wait time is really great, normally you get in within 5-10 minutes.  Go see them!
1 The worst exam ever! Uncaring PA. Uncaring doc. She might as well retire since she only sees patients 3 times a week. I cant see her in a timely fashion. Ive been in pain for 5 months. Still no answers. Im going to have to go in again! What a waste of time & $.
5 I love Dr. Mansfield and her nurse Cindy! They made me feel so welcomed on my first visit and they actually CARE. They were very professional, personal, and kind. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a great primary care doctor
5 I went in for just a massage and stayed! Outstanding group of physical and massage therapists, and top-notch chiropractic care. The front office staff is remarkable. I can't say enough about the level of friendliness and professionalism from this amazing staff! It's TLC at it's best, and  I'm feeling better every day!
1 The wait is absolutely ridiculous ever single time I come!!!! Dr. Yee is a quack doc! Staff is rude! I made my appointment for the first of the day and here I am an hour and half later still waiting!!!! Worst office ever!
1 Have been a patient here for 7-8 years. And I have LOVED it! But recently things are going very very south. I just had some labs done and the physician wanted me to make an appointment and charge me to come in so he could tell me that they are NORMAL. This is just sleazy practice to me. He ordered the labs so he had to look at them anyway. The visit to tell me that they were normal would only line his pocket with money. I am sadly going to look for another physician to see. Btw- this review is about innovative primary care as a whole. Not dr. Levitt per se since I never actually saw her. Also- VERY high turnover in providers.
5 If you want a person who is willing to listen and investigate your aches and pains this is the guy for you.   I had severe pain in my side to the back. It persisted for more than a year and I went to three internists seeking relief. None listen or cared and wanted to do whatever they wanted to do before addressing my concerns.  Jeffrey Trinka D.C. Listened and was able to give me the relief I was seeking. Dr. Trinka is a large man who is able to embrace a fat old fart like me fully and push and pull you in to shape. So give him a try when you are feeling crooked.
1 What a disappointing experience. Not feeling well and knowing my Primary Care Doctor's office had closed I decided to run to Urgent Care.  Unfortunately this was an upsetting experience. Upon arriving I was quoted 25 minutes. After 40 minutes I approached the bench and was told it was 25 minutes until I would be checked in...not what I was told. I wsa finally asked to Check In and asked how long it would be to get to see the doctor.  She said that would be another 25 minutes and to finally see the doctor could be another 45 minutes..Seriously? I decided to stick with them and finally made it back to see the doctor. The nurse was nice and when the doctor finally arrived she was nice as well and addressed my concerns very thoroughly.  Unfortunately my last ten minutes were the best, but overall what I nightmare.
5 Dr Gartenberg has been friendly and is always fast to respond to questions or concerns. She has worked with my wife and I through insurance issues. We drive across town from Glendale to see her. If you are looking for a GP that uses both natural and modern medicine and actively uses her online portal, give Modern Family Medicine and Dr Gartenberg a try
5 Dr. Yee is definitely worth the wait in gold!! ;)
1 I made an appointment WEEKS ago with one of the ladies of the front staff. I asked if it was possible to have a prenatal appointment at this facility, and she just said yes and asked for my insurance and all that good stuff. (This is my first pregnancy btw so I was eager af to get in there) I finally got there, wasn't greeted or even acknowledged by the staff, I finally signed in, filled out new patient paperwork, and waited about an hour. When I was called in by one of the front desk ladies (I think she wasn't the one I talked to, I think the light eyed younger girl with the pimples is 'cause her voice sounded familiar), I was asked why I wanted to see Dr. Duenas, and she was shocked after she found out I was there. I told her that the girl on the phone said Dr. Duenas is available to see me for a prenatal appointment. I took copies of my ID and insurance card and left. The staff needs to learn how to LISTEN while they're on the phone. I wasted so much damn time because of that great lack of LISTENING. My heart is kind of broken because of that girl who can't listen. I wanted to know so much about my new baby, and now I've got to wait even longer once I find an actual ob/gyn.
1 I'm very displeased with this place, today was my first visit. I came to get a certain shot only and they apparently didn't write that down in there notes when I made the Appt 3 weeks ago, the doctor was completely clueless and was arguing with me. The staff are very rude!!! I switched doctors to another place!
5 It shocks me to read negative reviews.  I have had nothing but positive experiences from the staff from setting up appointments, to checking in, to dealing with the nurse and the Doctor.  Dr. Nalini Velayudhan is an EXCELLENT Doctor.  She is patient and really takes time to listen to my needs and goes above and beyond to help me.  She is compassionate about her patients and I owe a lot to her for the positive results I have achieved in my situation.
1 The wife and I have been seeing Dr. Troy Bertoli for years now.  He is a fine doctor.  Spends more than adequate time with patients and listens to what you say.  There are more than one doctor in this office. Skip this office as the staff there are totally incompetent.  They can not tell the truth, they don't listen, they evidently don't keep proper records, and you can not relay on anyone to call you back. You have to relay on no response because most times they don't answer the phone.  The wife has just got off a call with them trying to get a medication refilled that they already told her had been taken care of a month ago.  Not! Every one you speak to has a different version of what went wrong and no one cares.  She started out over a month ago in preparation for a continuing series of shots (only twice a year) that she has been taking for the last three years or so.  They actually told her last week that the prescription she was asking about was not even on her medical records.  Really!  Why does it take over a month and still no prescription?  Still waiting for a phone call back from them.  The person on the phone today actually said they were "confused", well that makes you feel good about your healthcare doesn't it.  Once she gets this medication out of the way we are changing doctors again and leaving this nice doctor with his totally incompetent staff.
5 I don't know what the 1 star rating was about but that person must have been in a different office (and on a different planet for that matter) than I was in. Listen, when it comes to hitting any doc office I a as skeptical as they come. But last week I was trimming trees and I REALLY messed my back up. After enduring a week of excruciating pain (and gobbling down too may Alieve each day)  I broke down and went to see Dr Christopher to get some help. She x-rayed me, did a detailed exam, and performed everything from ultra sound with stim to giving me an adjustment. And boom. I walked out of the office with the first relief I had in a solid week. I have had MANY chiro adjustments in my time, and this was 'top notch'. Care and detail was given to listening to my issue and targeting the treatment to attack that. Thanks for the great adjustment!
5 Dr. Reis is a remarkable chiropractor. I highly recommend him and his staff for all of your injury needs. He gets people out of pain quick fast and effectively do not waste your time and see him if you are a local or just visiting.
2 If we could get my g-parents network switched over, I'd NEVER have them return to this St Lukes.  Quality of care seriously depends on who's on shift and what floor you're on.  Cath-Lab and ICU staff has always been fantastic, but staff on the 7th floor is a hit or a miss.  Likewise with staff in the ER.   Seriously makes me wonder WHY some people get into the medical field, when they clearly are not cut out for working in that type of environment.
5 I have been taking my daughter here since she was 1.5 now she's 3.5 so over 2 years. I now bring my son here!! We see Dr. Santos and he's been awesome! Very personable and honest. The best part about this clinic is that it's open 7 days a week!!! I hate that people always seem to get sick on friday at 6pm after every doctor office closes!! Well kids are not different. They open at 7am and thats usually when the sick hours are so if your little one wakes up in the middle of the night stay up till 6:45am and mosey on over. I've done this twice so far with not a single issue!  Most of the front desk ladies are nice. There is one that made me feel like it was a HUGE deal to add my 2nd insurance but I added it for my son at a previous visit and the other lady was happy to help. If you have something come up and you're doctor is off you will be scheduled with a different doctor. We've seen Dr. T and Dr. Naiman both of them have helped immensely. My sister even comes here now. Her son see's Dr. T because he doesn't seem to like older men lol. This place is easy and when it comes to kids it's nice for SOMETHING to go easy sometimes!
5 Linda and her team are amazing. They are knowledgeable in what they do and you can tell they care. I have had two different experiences with them for two different injuries and they have helped fix me both times. I like that they incorporate a few different modalities of therapy.  I hope to not have a reason to need physical therapy ever again,  but if I do I know where I'll be going back to for healing.
1 As a regular hospital, this is the worst in Nevada, possibly the Southwest.  For trauma it is the best there is.  Don't go unless you are suffering a serious gunshot wound or injuries from a traffic accident.  This hospital, particularly the E.R. is a County hospital and thus receives all the transients, drug users, and illegal aliens etc.  It is my opinion that they see any patient with good insurance or money as an opportunity to make up for all the tax-payer funded services they provide.  We arrived to deal with a complication from a surgery that took place at a very good hospital in Los Angeles, CA.  The treating hospital recommended UMC as having the best surgical staff in the area if we didn't want to drive back to L.A. for the small necessary procedure.  The directions we were given for UMC was have them do a CT scan and then fix the issue.  We spent about 12 hours in the E.R. and were then admitted for a procedure in the morning.  No CT scan because UMC said they didn't want unnecessary exposure.  The next morning nothing.  Finally in the late afternoon, just before the procedure they decided to do the CT scan and put off the procedure.   Nearly forty-six hours after arriving we were released after UMC did the CT scan, UMC having lost the CD with the CT scan and all patient information that we provided upon arrival.  They would not do the procedure, but we wasted two days when we could have been to L.A. and back with plenty of time to spare.    The hospital is generally dirty and spots on the 5th floor hallway floor, identified by a nurse as probably feces,  Were not cleaned while we were there.  The disinfecting wipes in the room were empty and never refilled.  No doctor was actually assigned to our case.  It was a revolving staff with no accountability and no sense of decisive work ethic.    I will say that all of the nurses were very pleasant and as helpful as they could be under the circumstances.  They appeared to be kept in the dark as well.    I don't know if this entire two days were wasted in pain due to incompetence, laziness, or a desire to milk money from paying customers in a hospital where most are not.    My advise, go to UCLA or Mayo in Phoenix for any moderately serious medical issues that are not an emergency.  UMC failed miserably on nearly every point.
5 This place is amazing! The staff is so kind and friendly.  My 5 year old has always been a bit scared of going to the dentist but he loved this place. The lady cleaning his teeth was so sweet and made it a fun experience for him. I kid you not, when we were walking out the door after his visit my son asked "can we come back here?" Oh and the kids waiting area is awesome!
5 What a wonderful team of professionals. My experience was handled with prompt, courteous, thorough care and genuine concern for my fitness and well being.  From Alareese who checked me in and out, to Diana my nurse, Rachel my wellness consultant and of course the man himself Dr. Allen a heartfelt thank you for your attention and service to my medical needs. You Rock!
5 This is a great practice.  Dr Chris and Dr O are both excellent physicians.  They also have a great staff in the AJ and Gold Canyon locations.  I can honestly say they really care about their patients and are very competent providers.
5 I started cryotherapy 9 wks post-op from a total knee replacement. Not knowing what to expect I was pleasantly surprised when it helped with the pain. Also, really helped take down the inflammation. Angelo is very knowledgeable and made the whole experience fun. I started with the intention to only do one but ended up buying a series of ten!
5 Matt Kraemer is hands down the best physical therapist I have ever worked with.  He has worked with me personally, and many of my top athletes.  I can say without compromise that there is no one better or more experienced when dealing with athletes.
1 Ive been coming here for over 3 years now. I have quite a lot of options gathered, all of them have been extremely consistent.   Pros: Doctors are nice and helpful.  Assistants are great at blood draws and pleasant, kind.   Cons: Absolutely horrible communication regarding payments and insurance.  Doesn't charge you correctly and then expects me to pay the difference even though it was their fault.  Front staff is rude and does not know how to explain anything regarding insurance.  Never told me there was a check in time AND an appointment time.  Never calls back when they say they will.  Can't keep track of client history.  Has told me that they haven't gotten my results back even though I got a letter in the mail saying that it was ready.  When I actually apparently have results ready they say up to 2 weeks for them but it's really 6-8 weeks.  Almost always a 20 minute wait or more after your appointment, and usually another 15 sitting in the room waiting for a doctor.  Set up a payment plan (because THEY charged me incorrectly for months) only to fill out paperwork again because they 'forgot' to tell me there was a minimum monthly charge.   And to top it all off, I was prescribed something that was 100mg, only to get a call 14 days later saying I was supposed to be prescribed 25mg for 14 days and then supposed to take the 100mg after that. Is my mental health really that much a priority to them? I doubt it.   Also, thanks for going weeks (multiple times)  without calling my boyfriend back who needed insulin to live.   Obviously I will be finding a new doctors office.
1 The front office supervisor is incredibly rude. Sad that my mom went to this office for years and this is how I am treated. Not only did my mom never get an accurate diagnosis when the entire world knew she had dementia, but now I am dealing with someone raising my own blood pressure. Ridiculous.
5 I love my T.O.P.S team!!! Brilliant staff, amazing treatment from scheduling, billing, therapy and all! Truly blessed that I can count on them to get me and my friends back to being 100%.
4 Maybe the Core Institute saw some of these reviews and changed their ways, I broke my hand on NYE and had to come here for x rays and a cast. When i walked in i was alarmed at how many people were there and figured i was in for a long visit. However the lady who checked me in said if i wasn't called within 15 minutes to let her know.  I was called in ten minutes. Pretty nice. I did some insurance stuff at the desk and they had me sit back down. 5 minutes later they called me back for my x ray. I waited a few more minutes and got my x ray done.  The x ray tech said if i didn't hold my hand still she was gonna "bust out the whips". Thats my kind of humor so i loved it. But some people might not, understandably.   Then i was put in a room to wait for the doctor. About a ten minute wait. We went over my poor hand, agreed on a cast and i departed on my final journey in this maze of a place.  I've never had a cast but they made it about as comfortable as i can imagine.   Overall, the staff was friendly, and my visit lasted about an hour.
1 The nurses are nice but the doctor is a complete jerk. I went to this urgent care from another on because they have an x-ray machine and the other one said I should get a scan. I could hear the doctor through the walks talking to the staff about not wanting to bother giving me an x-ray but he would, which he did then without bothering to come into my room decided he'd just send us back to the 1st urgent care with the disk and they could handle me. All of this I heard through the walls. They had my complete file from the 1st UC but instead of taking two minutes to take care of me, he couldn't be bothered and sat at his desk being a dick. I will never go back to that place.
4 Not sure the priorities folk have in a care facility.  I've only been in two in my 59 years.  No situation is perfect away from family and friends.  The biggest priority is professional qualified health care.  My experience here is about to draw to a close.  Been here a month.  Caring, skilled nursing care. Taken care daily by two amazing wound care nurses. Kind caring CNA's who for the most part do their best understaffed all facilities seem to be.  I would recommend this site to anyone.  Of course not perfect but I'd give 5 stars in the area of caring, trying.  I'm leaving better than when I  arrived.  Did I have to speak up and advocate for things I needed., Yes!  It so helps.  Lots of patients lots of needs say what you expect and need.  It can change your experience and then you see if people really care about what they are doing or not.  No one going through the motions here.  I'd come back if I needed to or had to.
1 Went there for the first time for a facial. An older European lady with an accent smelled like an ashtray did my facial with microdermabrasion. I have had many facials before.. this lady was so rude she was telling me my face is so bad and asking me if my lips are real 500 times. She barely steamed my face.. she did microdermabrasion for five mins and then starting hacking at my face like she was mad. She only did half of my face. Very judgmental and rude. This place is so unprofessional with no manners. I do not recommend at all for facial. My face was bruised and bleeding afterwards I have been doing home remedy masks to Get it back to normal. Worst experience ever
5 Dr Pragit has been my practitioner for nine years now, I follow her wherever she goes!!! Now she's at the wonderful My Dr. Now, Open 24 hours,  walk-ins available, just a wonderfull Family practice. Staff is always friendly and very patient, and I always receive quick and efficient service. I highly recommend my Dr Now.
1 I'll keep it short - beautiful space, bad service. I had an okay facial, but the lady kept trying to sell me their products by telling me how bad my skin is (which it's not). My manicure was pathetic. Overall, definintely not worth the money.
3 This place is behind in the latest technics. They don't offer very much. You're in and out within a few minutes.  I've been to other places that offer much more. Very basic.
5 I have been seeing these Dr's for years now.  I was tired of feeling like a number at my old Dr's office.  They are warm freindly and were very helpful when i got diagnosed with cancer.  Barb sat down and talked to me answered all my questions.  She made sure I was in a good place.  I took my husband in with me a few weeks ago and he was so impressed with the level of attention that he is switching.
4 Dr Wayne Davis is a great doctor. He is thorough, caring, and professional. I am very impressed with the staff and how the telemedicine works here. Takes a little getting used to but not hard to get the hang of how things flow.
2 First this is now novant health. I went to the urgent care care part three weeks ago for what ened up as the flu. The dr looked scared to come in the room and even said he didn't want to get to close. After he read the test was positive he told me he did not want to give me tamiflu as he thinks this will just run its course. After missing four days of work I called back and another dr gave me tamiflu even though it was too late to do much. At this point I had now developed broncitis. She did give me an inhaler but now 3 weeks later I still have it.   What really upsets me is I was told they charge a normal dr co pay. I now have two bills one for 350 from the first dr. And one for 750 from the second. Same practice same reason double the amount. I don't get it.
1 I was alerted by yelp that I had a comment on my review. Nice that 2 years later someone is getting around to apologizing for the horrendous service I received, but no, you won't make it up to me next time because 2 years ago after I left that appointment half way through, YOU sent ME a letter kicking me out of your practice, which is a joke. Lol wouldn't go back if you paid me!
3 It's a nice office and building. When I went to get my blood drawn at Sonoran I was in and out without making an appointment. The staff is quick and to the point. They are sweet as well so it makes the visit more enjoyable.
2 pretty decent so far as hospitals go, unfortunately under some of the worst terms you could ever go through, brings out the absolute worst in people. this location has seen better days, but sadly all of the focus and attention is on the new section of the complex(for a lack of better words) but when you go to the emergency/waiting room, is when you start to see the age of the building.  having said that, maybe it will set the mood for having to wait in emergency, with no means of communication to the party who is injured or sick, staff are not overly helpful on any level, matter of fact security is super helpful, they tell you where you can and can not sit! go figure. there is unpainted parts of exposed wall, and a t.v. that only have sports on at any given time of the day. the saving grace? a decent cafeteria, with Tim Horton's and mcd's across the street. the paramedics are delightful to watch come in and come out an be full of energy, probably due to not having to be in this desolate space. NOT impressed, hope I never have to come back.
5 This office is always prompt, impeccably clean and has a friendly staff. I have enjoyed coming here for many years and seen multiple physicians for various issues that have always been a top priority and taken care of. I highly recommend this practice to anyone looking for honest and wholesome care!
5 Dr. Nemanic is an exceptional chiropractor and I went to his office when I lived south.  He helped me immensely with a car accident injury which affected C2-C7.  His neurological background and studies brought new light to my injury and symptoms that even my neurologist did not catch.   His treatment, advice and knowledge has changed my life.   I wish I was closer to his office now in order to get there for treatment
5 This Elements studio has great energy.  The staff are friendly and welcoming.  I was matched with the right therapist for my needs.  Celestt is an amazing massage therapist with the ability to find and release the tension in my muscles.   I will be back!   The location is not as mapquest says....and being new to the area I was so grateful that they told me this when I called for appointment.   Having been a massage therapist for over 15 years I am particular about my massages and this one ranks in my top 10.
5 Excellent reflexology experience, the kind that makes you squeal like a pig in pain during, but leaves you feeling refreshed and springy after. No pain no gain! Toe pulling, leg whacking, tendon pinching, the lady I got did it all. She dug through all the fatty layers and eased out the scrunched up sinews and muscles within my battered feet and left my head tingling from the pressure points.   Super clean establishment. Germaphobes, rest easy. Hot water soaking tubs are lined with plastic bags and disposed of for each client, and the masseuses wear thin plastic gloves the entire time they touch your scuzzy feet and legs.  Everything is squeaky clean and new since they opened less than 2 months ago apparently? Nice contemporary decor, the most spa like of any of the other foot rub places I've been to. They offer your choice of complimentary beverages, and the room my partner and I were in had a big screen TV for us to channel surf though.   Best of all the prices are really reasonable and they have promo packages that bring the cost down further if you buy in bulk.
5 Kevin Clark is smart.  He knows what he is doing.  He is also personable and dedicated.  I have tried PT before and, frankly, felt I was not dealing with professionals.  Kevin is every inch a professional and I'm already seeing good results.  Thank you.
1 If you don't mind waiting a long time (hours) to see a doctor for a visit that last less than 2 minutes, this is the place to go.
5 Very skilled massage therapist. You are in good hands. He knows how what is he doing and will be very happy with the experience.
5 Reached out to this place in search of therapy for my mom following knee replacement and Couldn't be happier that i did!!! Susie Mireles and the entire staff here is awesome...my mom loves it and although it's hard she enjoys the progress and how attentive they are to her needs!!!! If my momma happy I'm happy!!!!   THANK YOU ALL!!!
5 This is a long overdue review but I think it's time to give this place a 5 star review.  I've been using this facility for over 2 years. I like the fact that they open 7 days a week and I can book online instead of calling in. I've been seeing the same RMT for the past year and I have to tell you he is amazing! Caring, understanding, and knowledgeable. As other reviewers said, they do provide tips for you to stretch at home etc. I tried to stick with them but since I'm seeing Jeffrey almost on a monthly basis, I do rely on him fixing my sports injury instead.  I highly recommend this place to anyone who have needs for a massage, as they treat you like a friend, not a patient, which I feel more relaxed and comfortable!
1 Painful experience- it's too bad that I can't rate them a negative 5 stars.   I was forced to come here for a workers comp claim.  So far I've been here for over 2 hours and they haven't got my paperwork set-up yet. UPDATE 4 hours into the saga and I just saw the doctor.  He said they don't have me in the computer yet, but that he could start the exam without it.
5 I was diagnosed several years ago with scoliosis.  Surgery was not an option and physical therapy sessions eased the pain but only for a very short time.  The deep muscle therapy techniques used by Grigor provide much longer relief.  I have been on a maintenance program with Prevent & Fix and am highly pleased.  Grigor is very accommodating, his facilities are spotless and he takes great personal interest in his clients' individual needs.  I would not hesitate to recommend Prevent & Fix to anyone experiencing pain.  Mary Ann, Scottsdale
5 When you become a patient here, you become like part of a big family. (unlike your real family though, these guys don't talk back or refuse to do things you ask them to do)  Dr. Eldridge, the DC, has a kind bedside manner and genuinely likes people. He doesn't ever make you feel like he's too important to see you - and you get in and out of here in a timely fashion - it seems that this place is one of the few in the medical community who realize that your time is valuable too even if you DON'T have a medical degree.  The office is clean and has lots of magazines and some toys to occupy kids who may accompany their parents or who need adjustments themselves.  There are massage therapists on staff here who will make you re-think your ideas of heaven, though they are frequently booked a week or two in advance.  The office staff is friendly and attentive, and you will enjoy coming here when you get to know them.  The bathroom IS clean although I do sometimes joke with the good Doctor and his staff that they need to "pimp their bathroom" since it is done in totally 80's Southwestern half-hearted decor complete with pastel wooden animals on the shelf next to the potty. And the paper towels to dry your hands with are located on the shelf over the toilet so you always drip on the toilet seat when going to dry your hands. Out of sheer horror that someone would think I peed on the seat, I always wind up wiping up the seat afterward.  The best part of all is that when I am hurt and cannot feel better no matter what, and I come here, I feel so much better after being adjusted and manipulated. Dr. Eldridge and staff are masters in the therapeutic arts and I have been going to them for years now, and I know that many of his patients have been doing so as well.  Parking is not a problem although it is in a strip mall, so front row is hardly ever available.
5 Absolutely wonderful!!! I was in so much pain. When I called to make a new pt appointment, I found out my insurance was out of Network but their staff & office supervisor worked with me so that I could be seen. The staff was ver courteous & professional. Dr. Pierce was great & took time to explain everything to me. I walked out after my appointment feeling awesome!! I will definitely be going back to see them
5 I started attending Foothills Sports Medicine Physical Therapy  in August of 2013 after having a knee surgery in June 2013. I had surgery in CA but had moved to AZ for school and needed a place to continue my physical therapy. I began going to Foothills on Kyrene and I was greeted by Julie at the front desk who was extremely friendly, welcoming and helpful. She helped me with all my paperwork as a new patient and was very helpful when scheduling my appointments.  I met with Carlos, the owner and head PT, who began my rehab with a thorough assessment that included several questions about my injury and surgery as well as a physical assessment to see what bothered my knee and what limitations I had. Throughout my sessions Carlos was always checking in on me to make sure that the exercises were okay for me. He wanted them to be challenging, which they definitely were, but he didn't want me to be experiencing pain. I was a patient at Foothills from August until the end of November when I hit my limit with insurance. I was feeling pretty good at the point. I was working out on my own and although I still did not have complete range of motion, I was pretty confident with my experience and therapy at Foothills despite the bumps in the road that come along with any rehab. Some days are better than others.  In January my knee started to get really stiff and I was experiencing a lot of pain and so I called Foothills again and they were able to get me in to see Carlos the next day and I began therapy twice a week again. Carlos reevaluated my knee, as I had taken some time off and things change so he did a new assessment and gave me new exercises to do. When talking with Carlos, it was very clear to me that he is very qualified for his position as he always knew what he was talking about and he was able to explain things in a way that I was able to understand, not always speaking super scientific. He also was a motivator for me. There were times during my rehab that I wanted to give up, my knee was agitated and I was beginning to worry that I was going to have to have another surgery. I expressed my concern with Carlos and we modified my exercises and stopped doing some of them. Within a week or so I was basically pain free again and by the time I stopped my therapy session in May I had almost complete range of motion! Carlos did a great job of encouraging me to push through. He was able to explain to me more about my surgery and the complexity of it, that it takes time to heal after a surgery like the one I had. He was always reminding me that even though I was not able to do some of the things I wanted to do, that I was able to walk and run and that alone is really good!! His encouragement kept me going. The Foothills staff is awesome!! The ladies at the front desk are extremely friendly, always greeting everyone when they walk in and ask how they are doing. Daniel and Joe, a few of the techs, always made physical therapy an enjoyable place to be. I never dreaded going to physical therapy, it was something that I always looked forward to. Not to mention, their new location on Elliot is awesome! There is a lot of room for all the different patients to do their exercises and not have to worry about being in the way of others. It is very spacious and clean with some awesome new equipment which allow for a lot of variation in exercises.  Overall I had an awesome experience with Foothills, everything about it was great! If anyone I know needs physical therapy, I'm definitely recommending them to come here!!
1 Doctors i think are ok.  Just doctors.  The wait to see the doctors is horrible.  Every time i come here the wait is at least 45 mins.   I really need to get a new doctor!
1 I have been going to this practice for close to 10 years! Dr. Shockey used to be amazing! He still very nice and professional, but doesn't seem to care about all the negative reviews on his front office! I went in for a billing question and was asked to state my question at the front desk (in front of all patients in the waiting room). Never did I get asked if I'd like to speak about it in private! I then was told "it is what it is there's really no questions to be asked". I've also left multiple multiple voicemails and received a call back once. Billing department is horrible! Very unprofessional and not personable at all!!! Very unsatisfied with their customer service lately! Can never get a hold of any doctors or nurses even if you try 100 times! Front office is very rude and snobby on the phone as well as in person! My family and I will be searching for a new PCP!
1 I don't know why the Urgent Cares in Las Vegas and surrounding areas are SO BAD, but they are..   I went here for an earache that came on suddenly and filled out the paperwork and waited for a bit and then heard the girl at the front desk talking to someone and found out it was the doctor who was suppose to be on duty and she was telling the person they had 5 appointments and 4 people who walked in so I went up and asked her what was up and she said the doctor was going to be late so I asked her if ANY doctor was there and she said no.. I then asked her if this place was for appointments only and she said no, but appointments come first.  Isn't this an Urgent Care???  Therefore I wasted an hour waiting for a call to see the doctor, but instead HEARD a call from an absent doctor.  In the future just TELL people there's not a doctor present without us going through paperwork and insurance information.  What is the matter with LV Urgent Cares?  It's crazy..
5 PA Jim Marczak, his medical assistant Debbie and front office receptionist Brittany are all SUPER SUPER AMAZING!!!!!!! Jim, he listens so well and truly tries everything he can to help you get better! I see them all on a monthly basis and drive 45 mins to get to the office, that's how much I love them all! No matter what my needs, issues, concerns are, they are quick to get me in and get me taken care of! Thank you so much for everything you all do!
1 Ridiculously bad "doctors."  The internet helped me with my foot problem, but the "doctor" didn't seem to want to really help me at all with my real problem (my foot), he really wanted me to say that I was depressed or anxious so that he could give me some meds!  "So...are you depressed?" "No."  "Are you sure???"
1 Abusive, demeaning, profiling, and discriminative behavior from so called specialists and back office personnel. I have a spinal cord injury from being ejected from a vehicle at a high speed shattering my T-12 into my spinal cord. Dr. Kramer and his MA never once made eye contact and snubbed me from the moment I walked into the office. Once they found out I knew what I was talking about as far as my incomplete chance fracture, I saw a small amount of sympathy only because its an absolute miracle I am walking on my own within a year of injury. I have seen many doctors throughout this year and never have I met such a team of incompetent, disrespectful people. I am appalled and advise anyone with substantial pain to stay clear from this particular pain management office. ZERO INTEGRITY in dealing with others and there is absolutely no excuse for this type of treatment from anyone let alone a Doctor who took the Hippocratic oath to uphold ethical standards. I will continue on cash paying with a credible doctor.
5 I woke up with a rib out today in horrible pain, while on vacation in Arizona. Dr Stewart brought me in and saw me immediately. Can't tell you how much I appreciated his attention and willingness to fit me in as a new patient! He was wonderful and his staff is very friendly. Thank you Dr. Stewart!!
5 I have never liked 'working out'.  I hate 'gyms' and am not a self motivator when it comes to working out.  I need to participate in an actual activity like tennis, hiking, running, etc.    When I lived in NYC I decided to get serious about my fitness routine and started working with a trainer (Radu Fitness).  THAT changed my outlook on 'working out'.  I loved my trainer and she kicked by 'behind' 4 days a week.    Once we moved to Pittsburgh, I was extremely disappointed with the work out scene ... the gyms (joined The Rivers Club, LA Fitness, JCC, etc.) didn't work for me and the trainer selection was very poor.    A mere 4 months ago I stumbled upon The Pilates Center of Pittsburgh.  While I continued to be fit through running and outdoor activities, my herniated disc was limiting my enjoyment and frequency.  My Neurosurgeon said that I had to develop my core while not straining my back.  He suggested that I try Pilates.  Not knowing anything about Pilates, I made an appointment with at the Center and met Lesley.    I have to admit that at first, it was a little intimidating and a bit complicated and I felt a bit awkward in the movements.  Sometimes I thought that I was never going to 'get it'. During those first few weeks I never ONCE felt  embarrassed or uncomfortable.  With kind and generous trainers I became hooked!    I have never had a weight problem .... but as I reached my 40's I was definitely becoming 'soft' all over.  Four months later I feel strong and according to my friends, co-workers and husband, look better than ever!!!    In addition to all of that good stuff my back feels so much better and my running has greatly improved.  Pre-Pilates I would run 3 miles and walk like an old lady for the remainder of the afternoon or be stiff and sore the next morning.  Three months into Pilates I decided to take a short run.  Low and behold, my Nike Fuel band was telling me that I ran a 5K.  I felt awesome ... so awesome that I ran an additional 5K!!    If you are looking to zone out on the treadmill .... Pilates is not for you.  If you are not serious about changing your body posture and composition...... Pilates is not for you.  If you do not enjoy understanding your body and how it really moves ..... Pilates is not for you.  If any of the aforementioned sounds intriguing, then give Pilates a try.    I highly recommend The Pilates Center of Pittsburgh.  Lesley and her wonderful trainers (Allie, Erin, Michelle, Cecile) are bright, focused, kind and skilled.  Each has their own unique style but the consistency of the technique is quite impressive.  Good luck!!
1 I asked for a family doctor and was told that they are not accepting patients...I asked to be referred to the dermatologist and was told that I have to get a family doctor  referral..Most Ontario citizens do not have a family doctor...I really don't know what to say but this a  medical clinic that frankly is looking for excuses not to accept new patients...They also refuse to disclose the educational backgrounds of the doctors....and expect people to take a chance...I am very disappointed with this clinic that operates like an average impersonal medical clinic...Let's deal with the reality of Ontario....and the medical profession.. My MPP is DR. Eric Hoskins and I am not impressed...Most people in Ontario do not have a family doctor..
2 Called yesterday 3 times for my father who is the patient. Asked to speak with the PA and the next two times to his Dr. Baker. Was requesting an order be written for home healthcare as he is sick and weak and being paralysed on the right side almost impossible to get to the bathroom . First they told me the PA was off on Monday's,then later I was told not true she was in fact in that day. Was told my call would be returned and that it was marked urgent. No one called me back.  The favorite go to is line is "go to the ER" well this man just needs help going to the bathroom and the only one who can write the order for a Medicare approved Nurse is the Doctor.  We're at the mercy of a business that is too big to really care about our needs and is over their heads with clients/revenue.
5 Went here for my shoulder because I had surgery done  on my labrum. They are very friendly and give every client their full attention, and they won't let you slack off. You learn alot in terms of posture and proper movement while performing the exercises. It's great because if you do any type of sport or training their proper techniques transfer over easily. One piece of advice is to do their recommended exercises at home when ever you can. It helps out big time. I had to learn the hard way.
5 I see Laurie Michlin at this practice and love her beyond words. I have never ever had a problem getting a prompt appt with her - not always same day, but never some long wait that makes me feel like they don't value my patronage or that my issue is not important to anyone but me. I started bringing my daughter here as well once she was 13 or 14 because I like Laurie that much. My boys still go to a pediatrician, but my 15 1/2 year old daughter and I rely on Laurie.  I can understand some low ratings for office staff; everyone has bad days so I can't say that these individuals didn't face some negative interactions,. and I understand they're not the type of office staff to visit with you and be CHEERFUL, necessarily, but they are always, ALWAYS, courteous. In fact, one day in the past 2 months or so I got in a pretty serious argument with an increasingly confrontational and seriously rude old man in the waiting room. He was so awful he eventually made the desk attendant leave crying; he was blaming her for things that weren't even done by her, and even after she apologized for the problems he'd had, he decided that was a good time to reiterate everything that pissed him off. I just couldn't believe it. My hope is that once the doctor heard about the patient's treatment of his staff, he would be letting him go. That's only fair. These women don't go to work everyday and work hard just to be mistreated. The nurses and/or medical assistants have always been phenomenal as well. Return phone calls, treat you like a VALUED visitor, just super great.
4 I chose Advanced Manual Therapy in hopes that they would speed my return to an active lifestyle after a serious shoulder injury. I found the Advanced approach to hands-on therapy to be just what I needed. I was motivated to work harder and gained greater range of motion and strength after only a few sessions. The soft-tissue massage combined with aggressive stretching made a positive difference in my case. Highly recommended.  Thomas B.
5 Very knowledgeable about travel needs and great for walk-ins and quick appointments.  I've gotten several shots here last minute including the flu-shot, Twinrix and more.
5 Jacqueline Frasca F.N.P. literally saved my husband's life.  As a smoker for many years, she advised a yearly chest x-ray and each year his test results came back as normal.  Thinking he would skip this year, she was persistent that he have it done and the x-ray came back showing  a small right lung nodule.  Further tests were ordered and the result was a large mass on his left kidney; surgery was the next step.  He is now back home recuperating with a good prognosis  due to early detection and Jackie's excellent follow-through.  We are both grateful to Jackie for the excellent care she provides to both of us and for her wonderful staff of caring professionals.
5 It would be a better world if more companies had a staff like vital care rehabilitation does. Professional service with a family feel. Please keep up the good work.
5 Highly recommend this place.  The staff is friendly, they take very good care to get you in and out, and their new location is easy to get to.  I have been going to Atlas (before they were Atlas) for several months, and I feel better than have in years.  Energy is way up, my gym recovery is best it had been in years....overall quality of life has improved greatly.
3 For the office as whole I give EVFP 3 stars. They are usually relatively speedy about giving you an appointment, a lot of times it depends on the doctors. Although you can always get in right away to a PA, which depending on the issue is just perfect. The phone system is easy to navigate and I like that it is really easy to leave a message for your Doctor's assistants, and they are really good about calling you back. A lot of the time I call and leave a message and hear back by the end of the day. My doctor is Paige Walend MD. and I love her! She sits with you and takes as much time as you want to ask any and all questions. I never feel rushed or that I am one in a sea of many. She talks about her children and always asked about my life. It is almost uncanny what she remembers about what I have told her in the past. So if I was giving stars for my Dr. I would give 5! Overall, I think the location, on Chandler Blvd, just east of Dobson, is a great convenient location. And I will continue to see Dr. Walend.  Oh on a side note, sometimes the ladies where you check in seem like they are over worked and unhappy, but then other times they are the nicest people you have ever met. Maybe it just depends on the day!
5 I just started Physical Therapy at this location and everyone here is friendly! I love the energy here! I highly recommend this place!
4 Best massage I have ever had.  Really listened to where my pain was and focused on that area.  Only reason I'm docking one star is because the room I was in was VERY cold.  I understand its an old building and they probably can't regulate the AC as well, but I was freezing!
3 Running injury sent me here.  I do like the physiotherapist that i was assigned to.  She's quite helpful and after a couple treatments - I'm back up and running again.  (Her name is Celeste)  I do though find the the admin staff a bit standoffish and even rude at times.  They chitchat & laugh amongst themselves while clients wait to be acknowledged. Anyways - small annoyance.  Also - I clearly indicated on my form that they can send me email reminders instead of call - but they still call everytime.
1 This clinic is horrible! Dr. Kuhn and Marla are fabulous. As is Linda. Do not go see Dr. Hawkins unless you like a cold fish like bedside manner. I waited 1 and 1/2 months to get in to get help with a sinus infection and now I am waiting almost 24 hours for my meds. They still have not  faxed  Walgreens to confirn the script. I want to go back to Dean Care!!!!
2 Being brand new to the area I hadn't had a chance to set up a doctor yet. Naturally when I got one of the worst unitary track/kidney infections of my life I came running as fast as I could here. They charged me a new patient fee at the front desk ($50) honestly at the time I didn't care I could barely move. Go in, Dr prescribes meds. Go out and the person at the front fest says he can fill all 3 scripts for $15 a piece. I have BCBS. I told him I could go to the pharmacy and would it would be almost free. He said you don't have to wait I have them all bagged up for you and you can feel better in minutes. Also the doctor expressed concern about my urine and said she highly suggests sending it to a lab  I just got a bill for $155. New patient fee, pregnancy test?!? (Sorry but my pregnancy tests are a dollar)  and something else. I paid more than $300 for a urinary track infection. I can't believe it.  Especially with amazing insurance. Don't go here.  They are money hungry and take advantage of people sick and in pain.
1 I had an appointment with Dr Sparling  4/14/2017 at 1pm,his office called me 4 times to verify this appointment ,and to make sure I would show up. Two hours before my appointment they called and said Dr Sparling had an emergency and my appointment was cancelled. This is the second time this has happened ,and they now expect you to wait two months before they can offer you another appointment . Dr Sparling is very personable ,but he never follows up with your treatment ,and sends you to see a specialist each and every visit . I moved to Vegas from Houston,and the medical care in vegas leaves much to be desired. Healthcare Partners seems to be only in the healthcare business for financial gain ,and has no other agenda except making as much money as fast as possible .
4 I think they do a pretty good job here.   I appreciate the doc's frankness.
5 Recently retired from military after 30 years of service, I have collected quite a few injuries. It was very refreshing  to find doctors and staff that doesn't try to resolve your physical injuries with medication! The staff is wonderful and motivated to resolve all your injuries to enable you to get back to an active and productive life style.  They run a class act! If you are looking for healing of physical injuries this is the best and in my opinion ONLY place to go! I am so great full for the wonderful staff at the central office....Betty,Jessica, Dr. Paul and of course Dr. Woo you guys rock!
1 I thought I gave this place a fair shot didn't care for the 1st doctor I went to even though he was highly recommended by my friend still saw him twice waited over 3 hours the 2nd time. The 1st time I had to wait over 2 hours. Each time I left there feeling as if I had been berated as a small child would-be ....ok I'll give it another shot...went to PA Joe E who was a horribly arrogant and just plain rude. Basically he just walked out of the room while I was mid sentence saying "oh here we go again...".   And would it hurt his nurse to smile or even look you in the eye? The only good thing I found was the front office staff. They were very friendly and nice....maybe they could give a class to the doctors there. I'll never return...find a better place people
1 This place takes to damn long the Mesa location got me out in 20 min I come in to get drug test for work and I need in and out there staff is so slow
5 This place is amazing the staff are so nice and attentive. Dr. K is awesome and always makes sure you feel ok so that she can do her magic. my back feels amazing after she adjusted it
5 Loren Eberhardt is a GREAT doctor!!!!!!!!  The staff is friendly and knowledgable. At times the wait is a bit long, but good service is worth the wait.
5 Cloud care reviews here are confusing BECAUSE the building is supposed to be a one stop shop for all health care but the service of each office/floor is very different.   There's an underground parking by Dundas square west of the building or an above ground parking east and south 2 mins walk.  Expensive cuz it's downtown parking!  There's both stairs(done but not finished pretty) and elevator to access all floors of this building that's part Hakim Optical.   I've seen the walk in doctor in the basement floor 2.5*, and the chiro/physio/RMT office on 3rdfloor which is the 5*.  Haven't seen the pain specialist or naturopath dr but hear good things.   Walk in Dr review - been here twice and seen the place once empty and still had to wait when no one was in any of the rooms. Large enough waiting area with magazines and cp24 on the widescreen tv. The secretary can be off putting but when she heard dr frank upstairs sent me her tune changed. The dr seemed tired/bored of the place but he did his job properly.   Chiropractor: Dr Frank I've followed Dr Frank from another office to this downtown location, it's been at least 6 years since getting treatments from him. He's got a very easy going persona and honest credibility. He's knowledgable and if uncertain he's not afraid to say so to me and look into it further. He will recommend what he believes to help without pushing nonsense like some chiros I've seen/heard about buying packages and over adjusting. I like his orthotic provider and choices of finished.   I only see him as I have other therapist I see for other issues, and Frank doesn't pressure me to visit everyone in the building(the goal of the one stop shop).  My friend has seen both physio (Tim) and RMT (Nancy) on top of Frank and says they are very knowledgeable as well and uses them for his sporting injuries.   Secretaries all seem nice, they will direct bill (if your plan allows it)and help check/verify your coverage if you ask them. Office is new and modern, looks just like photos online.   I trust Dr Frank, hate finding parking though
5 I was so thrilled when Relevation opened downtown. They offer a variety of classes and times that work for me. It's easily accessible, and they have a locker room I can use after my class. Jen is truly wonderful. She knows her clients and makes class fun. I've tried Mat Pilates, TRX and Reformer Pilates. I really like all of them because they offer different things. I'm moving out of downtown soon, but I'm still going to come to Relevation!
5 Dr Jazz was great! Im used to chiros that put me through an assembly line not even really noticing the issue. Dr Jazz is more thorough and takes the time to treat the problem and help prevent it from triggering in the future. Thank you doc :)
1 Unfortunately, both my husband and I saw her.  I was in for a prescription refill and check up. Dr. said it would be at front desk.  I0 Left the office without the rx form.  Called to see if I could come back and get my rx form to take to pharmacy.  They insisted I make ANOTHER (PAID)  APPOINTMENT.  I argued with the front desk.  Are they serious?  I can't come back and just get my form?  Husband called too.  Both of us were reasonable.  No budging.    2 days later a form letter, signed by Dahlia, arrived in the mail.  She FIRED both of us as patients.  Something is wrong in this office.
5 The receptionists do good job and the doctor is very nice and polite. They give thorough explanations in fun and energetic atmosphere. This is definitely one of the best, if not the best, walk-in clinics in downtown Toronto
3 The reviews are accurate...the wait time is horrendous here but MD Adams is a great doctor. My appointment of 10AM ended up being an appointment of 12:30PM. Bring a book or your iPad because you're definitely going to be waiting for at least 2 hours and most likely longer.   However, after meeting MD Adams, I felt like she listened to my needs and shared with me information that were news to me. Prior MD's weren't as attentive as she. Despite the long wait time, I would still recommended her.
5 Dr. Hatch is great. Very compassionate and caring. Whole staff from front to back are awesome. If he is unsure of your condition he will get you to someone that he recommends. Complete faith in him!
1 DO NOT GO HERE  I went here following an incident and work, filled out all the paperwork and stated why I was there. I waited an hour and then was told that they don't treat human bites. They also stated it was AN ARIZONA LAW that I had to go to an emergency room for this. I called Del Webb who laughed and said to go somewhere else. Thanks for wasting my time you ignorant @$$e$
4 Steele Creek Family Practice is affiliated with the Presbyterian Healthcare system.  I personally prefer Presby over CMC due to the number of complaints, malpractice suits, and assorted issues I've heard about CMC in the past.  When I visit a CMC doctor, I feel like a number.  Presby doctors have always made me feel like a human being.  The office itself is tucked away in a new corporate/medical "strip mall" at Arrowood and S Tryon.  It happens to be much more convenient to both work and home than the Pineville offices I'm used to, so I decided to give them a try.  I saw Dr. David Mendelsohn.  A young, fresh-faced MD with a very pleasant bedside manner.  Probably the nicest, most easy going doctor I've ever seen.  He took time to listen to my concerns and seemed very knowledgeable--not only about medicine but about the procedures involved with insurance and referrals.  The office itself is small, but accommodating.  It did not feel overcrowded in the least.  All in all, I think this is a welcome addition to the Steele Creek area and I think I might have found my new family practice.
5 Excellent treament. Clinic Director Eric Bloom is fantastic and smart. Loves his job and as a patient you can tell. Equipment is state of the art and clean. Front desk staff is friendly. Best experience to help after a leg fracture. So glad I went here to feel better!
5 I'm totally impressed with my first experience here. The front office staff were patient and helpful. Dr. Lily DeLatte has my vote of confidence. She listened to concerns I had and also expressed things that she feels needed attention. I left the office with a number of referrals which to follow up with. After getting my blood work done I received a call from Dr Delatte's office the very next day advising me of the results! I'm so thankful to be her patient.
5 I have always had extremely positive experiences at Clinic 24! I've seen Lori, Sabrena, and Michelle, and all were very friendly and professional. The atmosphere was welcoming and helpful and I've never waited more than 5 minutes. The quality of care has always been exceptional and prompt. I would definitely recommend Clinic 24 as a great all-around care facility with a wide variety of great providers.
5 We love Dr. Landers and his staff. This office is wonderful for the entire family. My children (ages 6 & 3) love going in for their adjustments. Dr. Landers always takes time to make sure that I am comfortable with all the decisions being made. I never feel like he is rushing to get on the next patient. The entire office delivers personalized care each and every time!
1 Dr DeWolf,  I appreciate your support in resolving this issue.  I am a bit confused that you are not familiar with my case since it was your office manager who called me and demanded payment and then threatened me with collection efforts if I didn't pay.  You can e-mail me at dtlin1@yahoo.com if you want to resolve this billing mistake.  Otherwise, my complaints to the AZ Chiropractic Board, BBB and AZ State Attorney General will proceed as planned.
5 Dr. T truly is an amazing physician. I feel like I have finally found a true partner in my health. I have been a patient for about a year, and know that she takes the time to truly listen to my concerns, questions and is just as much an advocate for my health as I am. She is hands down the most amazing doctor I've ever seen. She is dedicated to finding the "root" of any health issues I've encountered, rather than throwing bandaids (or a prescription) at a symptom like so many doctors. I've never felt rushed in her office, and always know I will leave with a great outlook and piece of mind after meeting with her.
1 My aunt is in this facility, and we can't wait for her to be moved. She constantly waits for medication in the evenings; sometimes up to 40 minutes for pain medications. She texts me telling me she is in pain and waiting, so I try to call the nurses station and I am put on hold for 10 minutes. Response time is horrible! My question is how do they know there is not an emergency situation when she calls. SCARY! Do not recommend this place!
5 Best place for treatment. friendly staff and chiropractors take time to explain your treatments and assist in getting yourself back to pre-injury.
1 Nothing but problems at her office.she does little except give referrals.everyrime I call I am on eternal hold and told sorry we are busy!! Was told I had referral for ortho.then sat at ortho office 2 hrs.never seen because no referral.wait time to see her is always an hour or more. She does not have enough time for radio show and practice at same time.only sees pt in afternoon after radio show.I would never recomend anyone to her !!!!!
5 Dr. Lundgren has become our family chiropractor, treating myself, my husband and my daughter. He and his staff are simply the best.  The staff is always warm, courteous and helpful. Dr. Lundgren is all of those things as well as knowledgeable, caring and just plain good at what he does.  I highly recommend Lundgren Chiropractic.
5 #TIFU (today I fucked up) last week I was like "oh yeah they're all blonde here" nope. They're not. Derpity derp. Apparently I have un dank vision. Revelations. Sorry for assuming, LifeQuest!   #TIL (today I learned) from LifeQuest that babies can be exposed to treatments as well that offer a variety of benefits like better pooping and better sleeping. This is a REALLY good grab at dads like me that are sleeping like shit right now because the kid needs feeding every two hrs... ugggghh  #ShowerThoughts standing up straight helps with living. Really that's the TLDR.   I really want to see doctor shara (good god I still don't know how to spell this despite weeks of visits now) host an AMA. Would be really entertaining and could be good publicity.
3 Every time I come for a check up, I end up waiting 45 min in the lobby and another 20-30 minutes once they take me back to a room. Taking 3 hours off work to speak with a dr for 10 min max is ridiculous.
5 Very friendly staff made me feel at ease right away. I went in for therapy after a shoulder injury which left me in a lot of pain. By the end of my session, the pain had lessened and I had improved range of motion. I'm certain my recovery time was shortened because of the physical therapy I received through M1. I'll be back for sure!
5 When I went to see Alper I was a mess. Physically my back was seized up due to my work lifestyle, and injury. mentally, I was so absorbed into my work I was very unhealthy. While Alper released the pressure on my back, we had a great conversation about getting me back on track. He was sincere, and unlike many other massage therapists, he didn't claim to be able to cure me overnight. He put the ball in my court and told me that as much good as I he can do, it is up to me to make form good habits, do stretches, and work in a smart way that would benefit me long term. His calming personality, amazing technique, and very knowledgeable advice about things I could do at home for my pain inspired me to make a difference in my life style and I am currently feeling great!
5 What a great experience. Found them through Yelp and was validated by their flyer at my local gym.  I saw Melanie. She has smooth hands, pointy elbows and great taste in music.   The office and treatment rooms were very clean.  Not sure what else I need to say? Left feeling much more limber then when I went in.  Highly recommended! Went for the 45 minute RMT and it was great.
4 teaches while he fixes you if you ask.   VA referral - works for veterans.  accepts walk-ins
1 I had been a patient at IPCC for approximately 3 years. Up until yesterday, I would have given 5 stars. Unfortunately, My provider (who was wonderful) left the practice several months ago. Since then, I've not seen another doctor. They have scheduled monthly appointments for me, and every month I have shown up for the appointment, only to be handed prescriptions at the counter and sent on my way. I am very curious to know if they've been billing my insurance for these "office visits". When I scheduled my monthly appointment for yesterday, I was told I would finally be seeing an actual medical provider. Yay!  And then I met Pam. Aside from having the personality of Kim Jong Un, which is forgivable if you're a knowledgable provider, she clearly had not taken the time to familiarize herself with my chart before seeing me. She proceeded to tell me that she and Dr. Dzung, whoever that is - it's not like I've ever seen him either -had looked over my chart, and that my neck MRI did not show any significant injury. (Just a shot in the dark- maybe because I don't have a next injury, I have a lower back injury.) Looked over my chart pretty thoroughly, did you? Then she says that the practice is moving to a strictly interventional pain management model, and since I've not had any injections (I've had numerous injections, including two epidurals done at their surgical center), they have decided I need to find a different doctor. Translation = unless you're going to allow us to stick needles in your spine at $10,000 a pop, you're not profitable enough to be worth our time. I tried to explain that my pain was being managed quite well under my current treatment plan, so I did not feel additional procedures were warranted, NOR WERE THEY EVEN RECOMMENDED OR OFFERED TO ME! Its not like I was ever advised to undergo some kind of treatment and refused! She wasn't interested in hearing anything I had to say, so I didn't bother trying to explain. She said she could give me a list of other doctors. When she asked who my insurance carrier is, and I told her Blue Cross Blue Shield, she stated that I would be hard pressed to find a provider that accepts it, because "it is the worst insurance company in America, and no doctor wants to accept it". How lovely. The best part of my visit with Pam was when she criticized my previous doctor's treatment plan in front of me. Really, lady who isn't even an actual doctor? Really. So, after 3 years of never having missed or been late to an appointment, always paying my bills on time, and just generally being a model patient and really believing that I was in good hands, one appointment with Pam was enough. I walked out of the office literally crying from the humiliation of being treated so rudely, and I will never go back.  If I were gravely injured, and I had to choose between Pam and an actor who plays a doctor on a soap opera to save my life, my money is on any of the General Hospital cast members.  Just stay far away from this practice. All the good ones are gone. I should have seen the writing on the wall after my first doctor left the practice, let alone once the second followed.
5 I would definitely recommend this facility to anyone looking for long term care, or rehab. The facility is clean, and the staff does an outstanding job of taking care of my Grandma! I visit often, and you can tell the staff genuinely cares about their patients!
5 Dr. Or is the best! I've been to several clinics in Nevada and none of them compare to the quick and friendly staff here. Dr. Or was able to see me on short notice and addressed my health concerns in a professional yet personable manner. He was very thorough and didn't rush me out the door as so many other doctors do. I highly recommend Dr. Or to everyone I know! :)
1 I had been on the hunt for a new pediatrician for my 14 month old daughter when I came across Dr. Vu online, rated one of the top three Doctors in the Henderson area.  Awesome.  booked an appointment then and there.   Arrived and the nurse that called us back to take her weight and height (never got her name as she was clearly not trying to have any kind of conversation at all, shoulder length grey hair) was short, seemed put out and bothered that my child was squirming as a normal toddler does.   Would have let her attitude slide if the rest of the trip was worth it.  So we kept on.  Dr. Vu was nice enough.  Kind of over simplified things without giving a real straight answer and I felt a bit rushed.  He recommended my daughter get two vaccinations that are normally administered at 15 months... and since she was only two weeks away from 15 months i figured we would go ahead.  He finished up and told me the nurse would be in to give her the vaccinations.   As we were waiting for the nurse to come back, my daughter was clearly over being at the doctor's office and started crying.  The nurse came in, same ray of sunshine that helped us earlier, doesn't say a word... sees me trying to calm my child, puts a piece of paper in my open diaper bag and tells me to lay my child down.  She then told me in the same put out tone to hold her arms better (my daughter is in full melt down at this point and she hasn't even given the shot) sticks my kid twice, slaps a bandaid on and walks out.  Not a single mutter from her.  She did not tell me what vaccinations she just gave my child.  She did not tell me what to do if my child were to have a reaction.  I was in such disbelief, my kid was melting down and everything happened in two seconds I had to calm her down and gather myself before I could leave the room.  I confronted the Dr. and asked which vaccines my daughter just received and told him about the nurse to which he responded "I'm sorry about that" in a not very sincere tone. If I knew who to contact to make a bigger deal about this, I would.   Long story short, they told me to come back in three months.  I'd get better service at a veterinarian's office.
1 I been going to DR. O'leary for almost a year and it's worser by the visit. The staff is super rude. The staff won't accommodate the fact that you are sick or have an emergency and have to see a doctor. You can't never reach him on the phone. I won't recommend him to anyone.
5 Dr. McCarthy has been my primary physician for over 2 years. Appointments are kept on time even late in the day. I am receiving quality healthcare and she makes time to listen to my concerns.  She gets 5 stars in my book!!
5 Lots of negative reviews written here but quite honestly I had a good experience at this Gibson Road Location.  I was a walk-in and It is first come first serve and you do have to wait your turn.  The staff was friendly and Dr. Hoversten was without a doubt the nicest doctor I have ever encountered.  I had an upper respiratory infection so was feeling pretty miserable.  The whole process took two hours, including the X-Ray.  I'm grateful for the care I received and feeling so much better.
5 Absolutely love this place! All of the staff are knowledgeable, friendly, and welcoming. They have worked on multiple family members with great success. Thanks Joe and the Ignite family!
5 This is my second referral to SpineScottsdale but for two different problems.  The first time it was because of a pulled muscle in my neck.  Shane and his staff were great.  I went to them for about 6 to eight visits and by the time Icompleted my visits I was pain free.  Recently I was referred to Shane for a pinched nerve in my back. He and his staff are the greatest and my back and leg feel great.  Shane has a great working environment for his staff and they all do an outstanding job in physical therapy and their customer service skills are the best.  Everyone from the front desk to all of the therapists and techs and Shane have a great attitude and make you feel very welcome.  Plus the end results for me have been exactly what I expected. I would highly recommend SpineScottsdale.  Bill P.
5 I was experiencing all manner of pain in my knees - it hurt to walk at times, let alone run or go about my normal activity. This worried me because I'm 23 years old and I was having the symptoms of someone twice my age. I saw a knee specialist and he recommended me to Dr. Amit Sahasrabudhe, an orthopedic surgeon. Dr. Amit then referred me to Endurance Rehab.   This was the second rehab center I was referred to. The first, Physiotherapy Associates in Tempe were awful. After diagnosing my problem (incorrectly, it turns out), they figured I could handle the exercises myself and pretty much let me be. Small wonder I didn't get better!   Totally the opposite at Endurance Rehab. First of all, they correctly diagnosed my issue: it wasn't my knees, it was my hips and IT bands. My therapist Mike DoVico created an individual workout plan for me and lead me through each exercise. Even when I was handed off to some of the other PTs, they each did an excellent job taking care of me and showing me exactly how to do each new exercise, as well, perhaps most importantly, keeping me on track.   Long story short: I can now run, lift, and be as active as I want - and should - be at 23. The staff and Endurance Rehab gave me back my physical ability, which is a gift that cannot be understated.   I fully endorse Endurance Rehab and will recommend Mike and his staff to anyone I know who needs to get back on their feet.
5 The service here was great!  They had me in and out in no time and were so helpful.  I only had time for a hydro massage but going back next week for a real check up.  My co- worker went also and loved it and my step dad swears by them!  CHECK THEM OUT!
3 The therapists are excellent WHEN you can get an appointment. The administrative policies are terrible making it a one way relationship. They can and will cancel on you last minute with no recourse or compensation multiple times, but the first time you need to its  $30 or they will remove your child from one standing appointment you waited forever to get.  Simply put they say they are accepting new patients, but you can't be put on the schedule for an evaluation let alone any session for weeks on end. Would be a 5 star place if they had better availability, were honest about availability upfront and mutually beneficial policies.
5 I didn't know what to expect when I purchased my Groupon for BYT, but after the first class, I realized how grateful I was to find this gem.   From the moment I stepped in the front door, I was welcomed into this peaceful, supportive and positive community. The instructors are very personable and approachable. All of the rooms are very clean and well maintained.  The ambiance in the yoga room perfectly matches it's function. The  mellow color of the walls, ceiling and floor does not distract, but provides a template for focus on the moving meditation. Yes, it's hot in the room, but after the first class I realized you could choose how hot you would like your yoga to be, by placing your mat in specific areas of the room. My stretches are definitely deeper in the hotter areas of the room.   The class is completely up to you. Meaning that instructors are very supportive and deliver the instructions clearly, but it is up to you to be aware of what your body is capable of, how you are feeling that day, what you specifically need to work on or through. You are instructed to watch what others are doing, which is helpful as well. My interpretation is that the more I am aware of myself, release control and follow the instructions and continue to maintain a calmness inside and breathe deeply, I am improving each time I attend.   I am absolutely confident with each and every instructor. They attend a 9 week residential course to earn their teaching certificate. Not only are the teachers able to instruct you on how to achieve the poses, but they are able to completely inform on the physical and emotional benefits that are happening to your body. Most of all, it's easy to see how much the teachers love this yoga and want to share it with others.  On a personal note, I just completed the 60 day challenge and have lost just about 20 pounds, gained flexibility and feel a lot more peaceful. I realize that this is not just a passing interest for me, I will be making this an essential part of my daily routine.  Thanks BYT!!!
5 Didn't have to wait long to be seen at all. All of my info was already in the computer so I barely had to fill out anything! Saw Erin, the PA and she was very sweet and personable. She helped me with what I needed and was very easy to talk to. Since I'm moving to Indian Land next month, this will definitely be my Primary Care doctor!!
1 Totally bummed with my experience here. The service they offer seems fine, but I do not agree with their business practices. They tried to get me on the hook for nearly $2k for a 6 month program, and when I told them I would rather pay as I go, they said it would basically cost me 10x as much. Why do you need to get someone to agree to shell out so much before even helping them? If you truly believe in your service, then why not offer a pay as you go program for a similar price? I knew it was going to be a bad situation when they took me in the back room to give me their lengthy spiel which basically went over a bunch of stuff I already knew about my back and neck... meanwhile I am in horrific amounts of pain and just want them to help me and charge me for the visit.. and then the guy tried to win me over by saying it looks like I work out.. ha.. I look like I sit at my desk all day so I knew right then the extreme levels at which he was BSing me.  The restroom would be fine if not for the robot that sprays you with harsh smelling chemicals as soon as you walk in. I can still taste that nasty assault from yesterday. Blech.
1 I was referred to Desert Valley Therapy for a sciatica issue. Sean did the initial evaluation which involved some basic movements to determine the source. Sean stated it was my hip and not my spine. I asked are you sure. Yes 100%. I want three times, each time I asked again to whomever was performing the therapy. Are you sure its not my back...  No its not your back.  I spoke to an orthopedic spine surgeon that told me physical therapist are usually wrong. The only way to know for sure is to have an MRI. The results showed a herniated disc. NOT a hip issue.  The spine surgeon also said he has seen more damage by physical therapist for issues like mine than any benefit.   Unless they have X Ray vision. Go instead to the appropriate specialist first to determine the real issue before proceeding on a path to permanent damage,
5 Chris Evans is amazing.  The staff is kind, caring and very professional. This is the real deal my Henderson friends. I have never had physical therapy before and I was referred here by a good friend.  Amazing how that works.
2 I go to the Ahwatukee office and staff is always friendly. Yes, you have to wait well past your appt time, but its not much better no matter where you go.  My problem comes in reviewing results of any labs, test, x-rays that are done to you.  I had labs done about 2 months ago and it took them two weeks to call and give me the results.  I had a MRI done on my low-back as I was in excruciating pain and I had to call repeatedly to finally get a non-nurse to call me back on a Friday night at 6:30pm.  She had no idea what she was reading and I didn't understand if I had a problem or not.  I asked her to fax me the write-up which she did on Monday.  I took the results to my Physical Therapist for him to determine what was going on.  I fell about 6 weeks ago due to the numbness in my legs.  I thought I sprained my ankle, but after two weeks there was no improvement so I made an appointment.  The doctor sent me for an x-ray.  I went the same day.  I called EVFM to find out why I hadn't heard anything for 4 days.  They sent a message to the doctor.  4 more days, nothing.  I called again.  Still nothing.  I called again on day 15.  They said the doctor had reviewed the x-ray and it said there was no ACUTE fracture.  I asked if there was a non-acute fracture since my ankle was still not getting better.  She said, I should set an appt to see the doctor to ask him.  I could be walking around with a stress fracture and doing damage.  The injury happened 1.5 months ago and I still don't know what the issue is and these folks don't seem to care.  I'm definitely going to switch doctors.  If you ever need anything done outside the office; I'd suggest you go to an emergency room or Walgreens for their instant care.
5 I'm a triathlete and I've tried many different sport massages. By far, Katie gives the best massages. She is very aware of what areas need to be worked on and listens to what pressure you prefer. I did a full Ironman three days ago and got a massage from her last night. Today I wasn't sore or tight, which is amazing since I could barely walk yesterday before the massage. I can't recommend her enough. Worth every penny!
1 Place seems like a serious scam! I called to ask how long of a wait there is for a new patient. I was told they only accept new "functional medicine clients." I would need to pay $250 to get started and a crazy quarterly fee as well. Besides the fees they would bill my insurance. Mind you I never even said what my problem was that I was calling for. What a JOKE!!! Craziest first phone call I've ever had to a "professional doctors office"
2 I was a patient here from 2014 until June 2016.  I've had two of their three pelvic physiotherapists. Front staff tends to be good, professional.  My main issue involves how the company professes to offer quality patient care, but shows limited understanding when money is involved.    This review is of my two experiences, only, with Synergy.  I stopped going in 2015, when my first physiotherapist interrupted me and insisted that the best results can be had by weekly visits, and time commitments.  I explained that I had a few young children at home, and she offered to let me bring my infants with me.  Nice effort, but not a reality.  Bottom line was that I could not afford the time to go as often as she expected, she was not interested in meeting me halfway, and frankly the costs kept adding up ($140 for 60 min; $85 for 30 min).  I began to go again as of Jan. 2016, out of necessity.  Recently, I showed up a bit late for my short appointment.  It was my worse mistake to date; I mistakenly thought the appointment was for 9:30, and not 9 a.m.  They informed me that they would charge me $50 for being a no-show.  I explained that I did show, and that I always do.  I just happened to be late today.  Receptionist said she'd get back.  She did, and told me that the committee she spoke with would reduce it to half of my appointment value: $42.50.   I'm not a flake who has ever made a habit of not showing up, so I didn't appreciate that they wouldn't make an exception.  I feel like my value to Synergy, when we come down to it, is measured in dollar signs.    This is frustrating.  I had hoped to find a physio office that would provide 'quality' care; be fair and consider their patients' situations, case by case; treat their patients like they are valued beyond their insurance money, and... money.    I politely told the receptionist that I would be finding another physio business that will be a better match for me.  Too bad; I was looking forward to my visit and getting somewhere after visiting there for months.
1 I have been seeing Dr. Zenner for about half a year.  If you are trying to find a new psychiatrist, I highly recommend going elsewhere.  I can't speak much to his personal ethics, as I really don't know him. He seems like a decent guy.  His professionalism, however, is insulting and unapologetically so.  I make appointments usually three months in advance, by necessity to get an appointment.  They do not provide any kind of email reminder service, even upon request.  They do call you the day before.  They won't call you any further in advance than that. If the voicemail doesn't work for whatever reason for the receptionist, she is not going to try again.  Of course if you miss the appointment, or are late, you have to pay something along the lines of $200 (fairly typical policy for missing appointments in the industry, but their reminder 'service' really sets you up for failure.)  Even so, it really is your own responsibility to keep track of your own appointment, so not horrible on their part, but certainly inconvenient, as well as unconventionally unhelpful.  Every single appointment I have had, I was kept waiting for at least a half hour.  At first, I thought, 'ok.  This doc has some patients who have just had the proverbial poop hit the fan, and has to extend the sessions.'  People have bad days, and I know I have been in situations where my therapy appointments ended at times when 5 minutes more would have made a huge difference to my functionality for the next few weeks.  We are all human, and if my waiting an extra 5-10 minutes means someone can get through their week, it didn't seem like the worst policy.   However, waiting a minimum of a half hour, sometimes exceeding an hour, proves to me that while he is more than happy to charge you for his time whether you make your appointment or not, your time is completely worthless to him.  Maybe a half hour isn't a huge amount of time, but if you are working a low paying hourly wage job, trying to pay rent, that missed time at work adds up very quickly into you not being able to pay for things like food or rent.   One day, I had the first appointment of the day.  I got there on time.  The receptionist was unfriendly and without a good morning, said, 'that's x dollars' as if I were buying a hot dog.  Admittedly, I was not uber friendly either.  I wasn't rude, but I also wasn't being paid to be there.  Dr. Zenner had his door open and was talking with someone.  It clearly was not an appointment.  He was really just shooting the shit.  Half hour into my appointment time, a guy with a nice suit and briefcase walked out of Dr. Zenner's office.  Dr. Zenner walked him up to the receptionist desk and they had some friendly goodbye words.  He then called me in.  There was no apology for the wait time.  No real explanation.  He mentioned he volunteers his time on Tuesdays and Thursdays (it was a Thursday).  I think volunteering is great.  But for someone to volunteer my time without my permission, during my scheduled appointment, especially when I was paying a lot of money to be there as well as not being paid because I could have been missing work (it was a weekday), that is excessively rude.  There is no excuse for that.  None.  And it wasn't just me!  Within that half hour, two more patients came in and sat down, waiting for their appointment.  None of them mentioned anything to the receptionist about being early.    I have been seeing psychiatrists for over 20 years.  I have had plenty of experience in seeing what is out there, what a good psych is and does, and what a poor excuse for one does.  Dr. Zenner is not evil, but he is offering a business that completely abuses you of your time and does not make up for it in any kind of special psychiatric skill.  He has not offered any real psychiatric help to me that I think any other psychiatrist would be able to offer ( i.e. maintaining a treatment plan developed by another psychiatrist).  Like everyone, I have problems, and I have found Dr. Zenner to be of no real help in getting insight into defining them, or finding their solutions.  There are better psychiatrists out there.  Much better.  Find them instead.
1 Overall just a poor service facility.  The only plus is the facility is newer and looks clean.  Could never find the facility doctor or the PA to talk with.  Had to tell staff to make sure to provide a certain prescription, administered after 5 days and our constant questioning.   If medication is administered check any interactions yourself because they administered several drugs that had an interaction which an infectious disease doctor had to come out and correct.
5 I have been a patient of Dr. Rosenstein's for over a year now. His office is professional and pleasant. What I enjoy most about my visits is I never get the sense that the doctor is ever in a rush. He always allots ample time to hear my concerns and is very easygoing!
5 This place is our hidden gem.  As a working professional couple with two kids and very busy schedules it's nice to have a place that is near our house that is very good with customer service getting is in last minute working around our schedule instead of having to wait for the next available appointment at primary care physician.
5 I'm sooo glad I found this place! Not only do they take my insurance, they are nice and have the extra perks like traction tables and water massage tables. I love my prev Chiro but he does not take insurance and we have EXCELLENT insurance because my hubby and I can go with zero out of pocket. Dr. is the best and on the first session he did a computer muscle scan to see where the muscles are pulling. Did the best adjustment I have ever had. I have been to at least ten diff Chiros in my life and I'm soooo happy with this office!!!!  Start going here! You will love it!
5 No one likes to go to Urgent Care but if you have to this is the place to go. Staff is super friendly, the place is very clean and they always take really good care of us. Every doctor I've seeing here seems to be knowledgable and most important they don't rush you  through the consultation.
4 We as a family have been here a few times and have always had a pleasurable experience.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  Their open hours are convenient and wait times are low.  If I have to go to an urgent care this one is where I go.
4 Went here for my Flu shot. It was great to be able to set an appointment on line to hold my place and then show up for services. Amy the Nurse Practitioner was great. There was still a wait of 30 minutes after I arrived but that's fine.   I travel for work and getting to my primary care provider is difficult so this was the best solution for me. I've always found Nurse Practitioners to be very thorough and Amy was no exception.  Nice to know of this option.
5 I had a pinched nerve in my shoulder for over 5 months, which stopped me from exercising and made my left arm pretty much useless. Nothing had worked: massage, acupuncture, the chiropractor. All just temporary relief. I felt 80% better after just one week of going to PPT. After 3 weeks I'm feeling normal again, and have started the path to regaining my strength again. I'd lost hope by the time I came here, but I'm so happy I did. All of the staff are great, super friendly and helpful.
5 Wish I could give more stars because 5 just doesn't do justice for the therapists at this location. From the moment I walked in I felt welcomed and they gave me their undevided attention and made me feel like I was their only patient when they had a room full of them. I will recommend them to everyone I know who needs therapy, the physical kind. The atmosphere is friendly and makes you feel relaxed. You get hurt.....COME ON DOWN, they will get you back healthy in no time. Thanks Emily, Ana, Robin and Ricki!!
1 I waited in the lobby for about 45 minutes before going to see Dr Shafer.  He was a complete jerk from the minute he walked in the room.  I already knew my problem was tendonitis of my shoulder caused by lifting my 9 month old daughter.  He repeatedly told me I need to change the things Im doing at home that are causing the pain.  I explained I cannot change that I have no help with my daughter and can't change the fact that I need to lift her all day every day.  He gave me a steroid injection and told me it will work in 2-3 weeks.  I asked for pain medication to get me through until then and he firmly replied "absolutely NOT" before I had even finished my sentence.  I told him I need some relief because I can't care for my daughter in this much pain.  He said "there are too many side effects in pain medications."  Well I've been an ER nurse for the last 15 years and I think I know the side effects.  If the medication is taken properly there shouldn't be side effects.  This is NO REASON to leave me so miserable in pain.  I just delivered a baby 9 mos ago and only took Ibuprofen after.  I am hurting and he didn't give a crap.  He abruptly left the room and left me bawling.  I had to go to urgent care later that day to get a prescription.   I work in the ER and people come in all day needing pain relief.  As long as a person doesn't have repeated visits we NEVER decline a patient pain relief.  This BRIAN SHAFER guy has no compassion and should not be a health care provider.   For the record I have never complained on Yelp.  I was so insulted and disgusted by this jerk I thought I should share my experience
5 I am greatly impressed by the both the facility and staff.  I had a mammogram at Magee in Monroeville, a UPMC facility.  That impression was totally one devoid of customer service and understanding of human interaction while this interaction was completely in touch with humans. I was greeted warmly by the front info desk staff that directed me to the mammogram area desk. They then greeted me just as warmly then led me down the hall conversing with me and asking if I'd ever been here. The waiting room I was led to??? A private room with my own sofa and flat screen TV with controls to adjust however I liked plus an area to change into not just any robe but a pretty one soft as can be fuzzy terrycloth and my own private locker. The room was not a sterile white one but with a soft color palette.   I'm saying all this because it was so opposite my previous  Magee experience (see my review) and was so caring for such a nervous experience for this, my re-do diagnostic mammogram.   In this same room a technician took all my info and entered it into the computer. I waited on my room with the door shut, having privacy until she came for me for the mammogram across the hall. The experience was one of her talking to me in general, being personable all the while.   Technically, I learned this was a 3D mammagram, while the Magee location mammogram performed was not.   I waited again in my private waiting room for the radiologist to read and interpret the tesults.  My same technician, Michelle, came to tell me the results. All is good.   My entire experience here was one of excellent care.  I didn't feel rushed and I didn't feel like a number. I felt I mattered as a patient and a human.
5 Fantastic doctor's office and pharmacy with friendly staff and short wait times. This office has a very good doctor. He was thorough, competent, listens and explains things, and I never felt rushed. Strongly recommend.
5 We just moved to this side of town and our youngest got sick. He wasn't an established patient yet and we had to get him soon somewhere since his cough was getting worse. But he also wasn't sick enough to the point of an emergency room visit either. So I figured I would call and give it a shot. Amazing. Within one hour he was being seen & getting a breathing treatment. Talk about awesome service! Looks like we found our new family pediatrician office for our 5 kids.  I can't thank this office enough.
1 My first visit with Dr. Divine was good. He was very attentive, answered my questions and was thorough. Then I got the bill for a couple hundred dollars. I was charged for every single thing we talked about. This happened every time I went there for months. I asked a lady at the front desk for an itemized bill and asked her to explain it to me. She had no idea what half the charges were for. The last straw was when I needed a refill and my pharmacy tried calling 3 times and this office never got back to them. I was a week late for taking a medicine that I CANNOT miss. Then when I got the refill, the dosage was wrong. You would think a doctor would know how dangerous this is. I'm never going back.
5 Everything about this office is great.  The staff is so upbeat and it is very easy to get an appointment. I saw Dr. Eisenfeld for the first time about a 7 years ago. He is the most personable, knowledgeable, non-judgmental pain management physician, certainly in Scottsdale/Phoenix! He is extremely well qualified, board certified as well as having the best bedside manner of any physician I have seen in this area! He is truly a gentleman who treats patients as people who are suffering and his call is to do what he can to diminish that suffering. He is the BEST.
1 Very unprofessional office staff. On more than one occasion they have shared personal information infront of other patients as well as had a hostel disposition when confronted with wait time.
5 My experience with Landmark Physical Therapy was excellent.  I got an appointment right away and was seen on time.  Mark the owner, is clearly very knowledgeable and confident on how to treat your problems.   I was referred to Mark through my Crossfit Trainer.  I had a non trauma injury to my shoulder that was getting worse day by day and I only wanted someone highly qualified to treat me.  He relieved my pain within my first visit and gave me excellent at home exercise to do in between appointments. The specific trigger massage was quite painful but seemed to do the trick.  I give this business and it's team 5 stars
5 Tom and his staff are the kindest people around. They truly care about each and everyone of their patients and makes you feel at home every time you walk in. I have been coming to therapy since 8/31 and have had great pain relief and after surgery they have helped me get on the right path! Super grateful for this staff! Thank you tom!
1 Total scam believe the reviews you are reading. Just buy the book online and buy the test your better off studying on your own terms.
4 I like the care provided, but I don't like the difficulty of getting appointments and the fact that Sat.'s are reserved only for urgent care issues and that well checks cannot be done on Sat. even if seeing a nurse practitioner and not an actual MD.
5 I saw Dr Sharma for the first time today. I had read the yelp reviews ahead and was actually skeptical that a doctor would spend so much time getting to know and understand the patient. I was proven wrong: Dr Sharma spent over 45 minutes with me getting to know me and understand my medical needs. I was blown away.   Office staff was very polite and the facility was well kept. Not packed at all.   Thank you Dr Sharma!
1 dont bother going here. the wait is ridiculous and the staff has poor customer service.  I waited an hour and a half and another time I was asked to come in "immediately" to discuss test results.   I waited 2 hours for that appt only to find out the tests were absolutely normal.   Waste of time.  There are better providers out there!
2 My sister recommended Dr Vu to me and I used to go yo his rainbow office. Never had an issue with my daughter. We moved so the horizon office is alot closer. Big mistake you Dr's have to realize that reception office is your face. No matter how great a doctor you are, the first people we see is the front desk. Please train them better that girl had been there long enough she should know better. I hate to find another pediatrician when i already trust Dr Vu. The dam girl at front is more concerned that I don't have insurance rather than if my infant is ok or not. Bottom line Dr Vu 5 stars, Anthem pediatrics 0 stars.
2 My wife was a patient here in May and June this year.  Her room was small and crowded and had a depressing view of the back lot behind a shopping center.  As many others before had stated they are understaffed and frequently there was a 30+ minute wait for them to be answered.   The RNs during the week as well as on the weekends were very nice and competent and very helpful.  The hospitalist was a lovely MD, caring and available about 3 -4 times a week.  The environment is a bit dreary and the food was  in my wife's opinion 2 stars. PT and OT was disorganized and frequently not strictly adhered to by patients and staff.  Transportation to doctor appointments was in an old van, on her back on a gurney, quite uncomfortable with no available seating for the patient. They returned an hour later than they promised keeping the doctors office from closing as she was their last patient.  The rooms and facility were kept fairly clean.  Not a terrible place, but not a place I would recommend.
5 I have been a patient with Athletica for the last 2 weeks.  I was coming off an ankle operation (kidner procedure) and had only been out of my cam walker for 3 days when I first saw the team.  3 weeks prior to that, I had been non weight bearing for a month.  Sandy quickly assessed my strength and flexibility and created a workout and home exercise program to help me quickly rebuild.  I have seen dramatic improvement in range of motion and strength since my first appointment and am now able to walk smoothly, with only a slight limp.  I have seen my muscle tone greatly improve and the myofacial treatment is dramatically improving the texture of my scar tissue.  I would recommend Athletica to anyone seeking to recover from an injury quickly yet safely.  The team are all athletes and they understand how to prepare you to return to an active lifestyle.
5 Dr Adams was very quick to do a diagnosis. She listened to everything we had to say. The office itself is really busy but with the wait.
5 I was recommended to Shaun by a friend of mine. I had a tear in one of my hip flexors that seemed to not be getting better. Shaun recommended I do a few things at home, see how it feels, and go from there it needed. My hip is feeling better, I've eased back into some of my workouts without issues, and can finally get in my car without any pain. Friendly and honest staff. I was hesitant at first thinking they'd do the free consultation and just want my money, but was not the case at all. Definitely recommend this place and Shaun. If I reinjur myself I'll definitely be coming back.
5 Great place. Wonderful atmosphere.  Shelley, the owner and instructor, is highly qualified. She's not only the best instructor but she's also a physical therapist with many years of experience. Classes are fun and a great workout for any age and levels of fitness.  She offers a free introductory class every Saturday at noon. Highly recommended.
5 Love, Love, Love Susan.  My family care doctor retired and I didn't know what I was going to do and thank goodness I found Susan Lasala Wood.  She is so kind, she actually listens to her patients, and she makes me feel so comfortable.  Love her medical assistant Lisa as well.  Everyone is so friendly and makes you feel like you matter and your not just another number.  So happy I found Susan when I did.
5 First visit, but impressed so far.  Gina seemed very knowledgable and the staff all seemed to work together to give care to their patients.  I asked several people at or waiting for appointments if they thought positively of Tru, as I was referred by my doctor's office, and everyone had extremely positive things to say.
1 Came in with a small stress fracture and she had me out of work for 4 months when I was ready to return in 6 weeks, according to the second opinion that I took too long to get. She will send you out for unnecessary exams, had me going to her office every two weeks with the promise of " I can almost send you back to work, it needs a little bit more time" The doctors here just want to milk your insurance. Its the perfect example of corporate medicine where people are just numbers.
5 Our family has been going to Vitality Medical for years and have nothing but good things to say about Dr. Cristy and her staff. What office do you go to and not wait? My thought to this is, they are taking each individual patient and spending time learning how to better improve their health. My husband was the first to go there. This is a man that works out faithfully, eats healthy, but we are business owners, which makes him work ridiculously long hours. She has helped him so much! He looks better and feels better now then a man in his 20's. I then decided to go to her and also feel so much better. I lost my mom at an early age because of health issues, plus I had skin cancer, and our family has a long history of health issues. So, I wanted to make sure and stay on top of my health. Finally, my 15 year old son now also goes to her. He was having issues with concentrating, depressed, short tempered, stressed cause of all his AP classes, hip hop, and Student Council. I contacted Dr. Cristy really concerned something was seriously wrong with him. He wasn't himself. This wasn't my kid. Her response was she thought it could be just food allergies and vitamin deficiencies. We did blood work and guess what! That's all it was. I would recommend anyone of my friends or family members to her. We love her and her staff!
1 I wish I could give ZERO stars. The receptionist had an attitude. I can tell Dr. Reddy probably first hand hired her with his disgusting attitude. This was probably the worst office and costumer service I have ever encountered.
3 Nice, clean and friendly facility the only down fall was I was The 4th person their right after they opened and it took 2 hours just like they quoted. Coffee and tea offered in the lobby area and a tv to distract you but still seems like too long of a wait.
5 Amazing office.  It's very central (just off Queen) and the doctors on staff are terrific.  No matter who I get, I've never felt rushed out the door.  Their records are electronic and always accessible, regardless of which doctor you get.  That being said - I agree with reception complaints: phones rarely get answered (I find I have more success using their general contact email) and voicemail is generally full.  I've never received a call back for any of the messages I have left.  Friendly isn't their game either - however, the clinic is stellar and reception becomes a minor issue.
5 Very friendly staff.  I was in and out quickly which I greatly appreciate.  I like the B12 shots and will continue to get them.  I would recommend this place for sure!
5 Dr.  Hisana Qamar is a wonderful doctor.   I have had such bad experiences in the past with doctors offices whether it be the support staff or ego driven doctors who haven't taken the time to read all the paperwork they just had you fill out.   I originally looked up this doctor because I got direct care insurance from mgm and she seemed promising,  and I just felt really drawn to her after reading up despite the fact that she is across town from me.   First off I call the office and someone answers,  they are so polite, patient and friendly, I already have good vibes.  It was easy to make an appointment that I didn't have to wait forever for as well.   I get there and the building looks like a mini white house,  and is directly across from Boca park.   I am greeted as I come in, and the office is clean,  and styled very nicely with inviting colors. I am seen very soon after I fill out my paperwork.  The super nice woman who works the front desk takes my vitals,  and then once she leaves the Dr arrives.  Not being stuck in a doctors office like its some holding cell before an interrogation, where they are trying to break you down with suspense is refreshing.   She starts taking to me about the chart I filled out,  asks in depth questions, and she writes down all the extra details I tell her.  She gets me set up with all the paperwork I need for referrals,  and tests,  and prints me out informative paperwork.   She was probably with me almost half an hour.   I felt cared for,  and that finally I found a Dr who is passionate about what they do.     She also performs woman's wellness exams which is great because she totally puts you at ease.  The room is lilac,  with personal touches, not the sterile atmosphere of most places where their white room and lighting make you feel like some weird science test subject. She also explains everything she is doing, and is very gentle.    When you return her and her assistant remember you and bring up past conversations,  which is impressive. I thoroughly recommend this office.   I am so happy that finally I have a primary care doctor I can put my trust in.
5 Fusion Kinetics is outstanding. I have long searched for a personal training service where I could not only get one on one training, but also find it integrated with all aspects of teaching me detailed nutrition for MY body, along with the technical and science behind what we are doing. It's not just come, work out and here is a meal plan etc. All aspects of your journey are noted and adapted to fit your body and nutrition. Also, they make it fun and approachable. You find yourself progressing in such a positive way, because they help you focus but ENJOY the process. I have a hip problem and was amazed at how I would work out my whole body through the way they adapted things. Their whole approach is a refreshing and smart one in the fitness industry. I have not seen anything like this. I will finish by saying their positive outlook as people is so fun and real. Their hearts are in what they do...they care which gives a beautiful foundation into the unique and effective services they offer.  In just 8 sessions, I have achieved so much and see results already. Fusion Kinetics is the perfect name for what they do. I am beyond happy that I found them. I highly recommend!
5 The kleven institute is amazing. I needed some rehabilitation with my range of motion after a double mastectomy and everyone there treated me kind with compassion and patience. Special thanks to susie who handled all things with my doctors so all I had to do is concentrate on my healing. Recommend them for all your body,health,and mind needs. Love them.
1 After putting up with this office for over a year, My husband and I are DONE!   The last 4-6 times we went to have labs drawn, the Lab would not be able to find our orders as DeRosa medical once again did not send them. The Lab commented that this happens alot from DeRosa Medical.  We would have to leave, wait for the office to open, attempt to call and after 3-6 times of being sent to voicemail someone would finally answer the phone. When someone did answer from one of her many offices, I would attempt to get her to transfer me to the office that I am seen in, but I would either get disconnected, or of course the  voicemail.  If you leave a voicemail it takes 4-6 hours before they get back to you.   Every pellet insertion my husband received, he  encountered a new nurse or usually one in training until he insisted upon someone with experience that knew what they were doing! He would tell them the pain he experienced the last time and they would say, "Oh thats normal with the amount of pellets you are receiving."   In one of his many visits with different PA's the male PA said ,"You aren't taking enough Testoterone, all men should be at 1200." NOW his hematocrit/hemoglobin is so high from excessive testosterone that he has had to have 3 Therapeutic Phlebotamies (Blood draw of 500 ml) and he is still struggling to get his H/H levels down.  They were not real confident in handling this situation! I went online to find out about High Testosterone (polycythemia) while  I thought this office would have been more informed. He is only in his 40's and is at very high risk for thrombosis and stroke! This is so dangerous!   They gave him very little information!    I had an appointment in March for some ear problems.  The nurse came in, took vitals and said the PA (David Sorenson) would be in shortly.  In comes a Medical Student and she starts to exam me then upon leaving the room states that PA would be in to see me.  After waiting a while, the nurse comes in and says,"You're all ready to go, we have your RX."  I said, " for what?, I haven't even seen the PA!", she said, "it's for acid reflux." Ear issues are now acid reflux??  You are kidding me!!!   I walked out of the office after 1 1/2 hours!  Two months later, I get a bill for seeing this PA. I called to let them know, I was not going to pay for a visit when I didn't even see the PA!!  I then reported it to my Insurance for Fraud!  Just recently, I did the usual call of 4-6 times  to confirm my husband's appointment and when we got to the office, they said, "You don't have an appt." Linda, the office manager came out from behind the petition  and said, "Well, we have alot of new girls training on the phones today." So that is our fault.   In the same office altercation, my husband asked for his H/H levels after his 1st phlebotomy, since they weren't going to see him for an appt. he had scheduled, and he was told by the front desk girls they couldn't give him that information!!  What?!!  Upon leaving the office that day, I left a message for Dr.Derosa to please call me.  The front desk girls response, "I will have Linda, our manager give you a call."  I said, "No, I would appreciate it if you would have Dr DeRosa call me." I have never received her call. This was the second time I had left a message for her to call me.   I would not refer anyone to DeRosa Medica.    Please do your homework if you plan on making an appointment with this Medical Office!    We are both looking forward to visiting with our new Dr.
5 Dr. Michael Trainor is the best physician I've ever met. I was in intense back pain. I scheduled surgery and within one week of the surgery it was like I never had pain. The operation was a success. He has a wonderful bedside manner and truly listens. And he has an amazing, caring staff. Dey and Lance are both hands down just as caring with Dr. Trainor's patients as well.  I would highly recommend anyone  in need of an orthopedic doctor.
2 Friendly N.P. Did some tests..my 2 complaints is that I had to wait for wks to find out about my ultrasound results and tests.And I had to be the one to call, followed up several times when they said they would call me. Another is when I made an appt...I waited over an hr n a half. Not happy. But like I said..my N.P. is nice n easy to talk to but the company needs to be more active on calling back their patients back and letting them know what is going on.
1 You're fired! I established myself as a patient so I could be seen on an emergent basis, if need be. The need arose and I actually had to cry on the phone to get then to see me even after I told then a registered nurse said I had to been seen that morning! They said they could "squeeze me in for a really quick appointment". I was really sick, and waited an hour and a half after they told me to be there to be seen and made to feel like an inconvenience. The front staff have no idea what customer service is. I couldn't even get a call back from the office for over six hours. This place is a joke. Of you are looking for care and compassion, go somewhere else...I am.
5 I came to this store a few months ago with some pain in my back. The staff was very knowledgable and professional. They worked with me to develop a treatment plan and now, my pain is gone.  I'm very happy with them and highly recommend this place to everyone.
1 Forte Family Practice USED to be so good but now this place is absolutely awful! I've been going to this place for years, since I've moved here. Unfortunately, they've grown too big to keep customer service and care important for their patients. You schedule an appointment that requires blood drawn, but they'll book you either for a time the person who draws blood isn't here or tell you when you've come in that you should have fasted. The staff is absolutely RUDE and inconsiderate. The nurse who took my vitals asked me if I'm 56 years old. Really?? You couldn't tell by looking at me that your math was clearly WRONG. When I expressed my frustration for AGAIN having an appointment that was a waste of my time, the doctor was rude and telling me the staff who answers the phone take 50 calls a day and wouldn't know what I'm being seen for. Really?? They ask me this when they schedule my appointment and I even changed my appointment to a time that the person who draws my blood would be here. From that they couldn't be courteous enough to remind me to fast? Who are they hiring for a medical facility? So basically I'm paying for 2 office visits because your staff isn't knowledgable enough to book medical appointments. Then he tells me when I do come back to get my blood drawn they will call me if anything is abnormal, BUT I NEED TO CALL them because he's seen it before where patients should have been called back in for a follow up and weren't. So, he basically admits to me how incompetent their staff is. This place is ABSOLUTELY AWFUL. Bad choices Dr. Forte. Clearly by all the comments your poor decisions on the expansion of your office has you loosing patients. And to think how many people I know in the hotel industry that are your patients and I've referred to you. This will definitely spread. You're clearly making money off bogus and doubled appointments. I wish I could put NO stars for this review.
1 So disappointed that dr. Courtney Harriger is no longer at the office. When I called to make an appointment they never answered any of the six calls I made throughout  the day. I went on their website through yelp to make an appointment and Dr.Harriger was on there so I selected her name and waited for a confirmation that I could see her. It never came so I called the office again and finally someone answered, very rudely might I add. I told her I never received a confirmation for my appointment with Dr. Harriger, she responded" oh yeah she doesn't work here anymore she hasn't in months." So I asked if there was anyone else I could see because I really needed to see a dr about my condition. Dr. Vasquez was recommended, big mistake. So unprofessional and he did not care one bit about my condition, he was so sarcastic and rude. Never coming back, he couldn't stop talking about going on his vacation the following week and all material possessions.
5 Dr. Mitch and the entire team at pain stop are the best. I've been to chiropractors my entire life and only this team can relieve my pain. Please contact me if you have questions about their treatment process
5 Jennifer is an excellent massage therapist. She really gets to know her clients and helps to ensure she works on the problem areas.  She is a great listener and applies just the right touch and pressure. I highly recommend her. Great location also at yonge and eglinton. Easy to get to by subway or parking under the building.
5 Truly a family business for families! Dr. Jones has helped me regain and maintain my health as well as for my husband and kids. His gentle approach is non-threatening and never painful. My 5 year old son skinned his knee and said, "You better take me to Dr. Jones, mom".
5 So happy my mother recommend this place to me I was in such pain I could barley stand and now I'm feeling better than ever with the help of everyone here I love this place!
5 This facility it my very first experience with physical therapy. They are very kind and considerate. They evaluate your situation and treat each individual with care and help. Bryan who is a physical therapy assistant has magical hands that helped my back from degenerative bone disease, something I had been in pain with for 10 years. I highly recommend this location on Craig road in North Las Vegas. Brittany, Shawn, Mike and Bryan all deserve the biggest pat on the back and a raise! Thanks for everything. Such a great group of people.
5 My primary care doctor is Dr. Nicole Johnson at ths practice. She is brilliant, but just as importantly, she cares about her patients and is a fierce advocate for them. Anyone needing a great general practitioner needs to get an appointment with her.
1 It's hard to find a good dr in Las Vegas, no this doctor and her staff are no different... My husband and I had been regular patients for years and when I first started coming to this office, I thought it was great. They were able to get me same week appointments and the wait was never more than 15 minutes and Dr Casalman really seemed to listen.  As time progressed, appointment scheduling became a joke, the doctor now seemed to pooh-pooh my ongoing symptoms and now the coup de grace, I didn't get a bill for one of my visits. Someone had transposed a 1 with a 7 in my address, so I never received the bill nor a phone call from the office (which they used to do), so now they have terminated care for both my husband and myself, even though he had no past due balance. I understand the office needs to get paid, and I'm not disputing that, but terminating care for a $20 charge on 2 long time patients does not seem to be a good business practice. I do NOT recommend this clinic.
5 My husband had surgery here on 2/16/17. The entire staff was absolutely amazing. From pre registration to discharge he had incredible care. We highly recommend this hospital.
5 We first learned of Dr. George while our son was in the NICU. The other family told us how great he was. Watching his interactions with the family and hospital staff made our choice easy.  He is the most caring and compassionate pediatrician in Las Vegas. He takes the time to listen to any concerns you have and answer all questions throughly. The wait times can be long but he's worth the wait. I've never had a problem getting an appointment even as a sick walk in.
5 These guys helped me a lot. Julie was my therapist. She not only helped me physically but at times she listened to my problems associated with my injury. They took time to find out exactly what I needed to get better.   Everyone who works there is friendly and accommodating. The lady at the front desk is VERY nice and I love her!  I went here for almost a year, and I took a while for my pain to go away, but it eventually  did start fading after going once-twice a week.  They worked with my schedule and called me if anything changed. They never once pissed me off.  Even after I left i had a hard time catching up on my payments, because I had lost my job due to my injury. They were patient and let me get back on my feet, and then let me make small payments towards my bill.  This was one of the hardest times in my life and they knew exactly how to help me. I had been to other PT places, and they did not work like this one did.   I am not 100% better but I am definitely living a better life because they helped me. I still do the exercises.
5 Me and my wife had come to Tempe from Portland Oregon to visit my family for Thanksgiving, both of our bodies had been hurting for awhile, mine was my neck due to sleeping on it wrong one night and my wife's body was sore from the 21 hour drive. My brother is a doctor and had recommended we go see Pam. Boy was that some good advise! Pam really knows what she is doing, she gave us both a massage that really helped with the soreness as well as gave us some really good exercises to strengthen parts of our bodies that were weak. We were so impressed with Pam's knowledge, all's we can say is, thank you, thank you, thank you, we are both feeling so much better!
1 My husband saw the PA Joe on Sept 5 for severe back pain. He made the medical assistant aware and also has it noted in his chart that he has a severe allergy to Naproxen. Joe was very rude, condescending, argumentative and abrasive during the whole visit. Joe went ahead and prescribed my husband Naproxen. Luckily my husband read the name of the medication on the bottle before taking it or he would have ended up in the hospital with anaphylactic shock.  That was strike 1.  I had an appointment on Sept 12 for a physical with Dr. Hailstone. I was called on Sept 11 saying the dr would not be in the office and they would have to reschedule. I needed to have the physical done by Sept 18 to receive incentive credits towards my insurance premiums. The only appt they had before Sept 18 was Sept 16 with Dr. Waltman, a dr I have never seen. I begrudgingly took the appt. on Sept 16 I showed up for my appt and waited an hour in the waiting room. I was finally called back, but not by a medical assistant. It was the billing dept stating that I had an overdue balance of $29 and they needed to collect payment immediately. I told them I had run out of the house without my debit card and that I would pay them later after the appt. The billing clerk said I could not be seen without paying the $29. I asked to speak with the billing manager. Kim came out and rudely told me I would not be seen today without paying the $29 I was unaware I even owed. I pleaded with her as I needed to get the physical done and she wouldn't hear any of it and escorted me out of the building. I was humiliated as I wasn't even taken to a private area to discuss my billing situation. Kim has no people skills and has no business dealing with the general public. I can't believe this office is willing to loose a customer (a family of 4) over a bill of $29 that would have been paid if I was allowed to see the dr for my rescheduled appt not to mention the insurance would have paid in full at least $150 for my physical today.   Avoid this office at all costs! Dr. Hailstone is an amazing doctor and I am very disappointed that I will no longer be able to be his patient. The billing fiasco today was strike 2 and I will not give them the opportunity for strike 3.
5 I have had back problems since I was a child. Then I was in a pretty bad car accident causing me ongoing daily back pain. I started seeing Dr. Enriquez for this ongoing back pain. Little did I know, so much more could be helped by chiropractic care! My headaches and back pain have been greatly relieved while under Dr. Enriquez's care. They have great massage therapists as well! I love that I get personalized care in a timely manner that really works!
5 The P90OX Class by Nadine was great. This class give you a full total body workout plus cardio me being a beginner it was great. She showed alternatives to the  exercise for beginner  intermediate and advanced so if you want a great body workout this is the class to take.  The workout focused on all major  muscle groups  With great music and easy to follow routines.
4 Dr. Norton was my OB/GYN for my entire pregnancy with my 2nd child which was a few yrs ago. He was amazing! He is very good at what he does. The reason i didn't give 5 stars is because i really wish he didn't seem so cold. He always seemed to be in a hurry and almost made me feel like i was bugging in a way. I understand that he's very busy but still. Other than that i think he was great! i actually can't wait to go back. which is weird lol The other reviews have me a little nervous though. I will definitely be updating my review as soon as i go back.
5 We found HealthSource after discovering that my son's repeated trips & sprains playing soccer had resulted in a mildly torn tendon & a very unstable ankle.  As a former massage therapist who worked 5 years with a chiropractor, I know a good therapist when I find one, and Patty is a GREAT physical therapist!!  In fact, I've been putting off a hip injury (since I basically know what I need to do) but after meeting Patty I set up an appointment for myself & she surprised me with a few new tricks that have been discovered since I was in the industry 15 years ago.    I would recommend HealthSource to anyone who's put off their healing since it can be such an arduous process.  Here the staff are all very knowledgeable and friendly and above all for me, on schedule.  You can actually schedule therapy into your day and not adversely affect work or anything else you have planned!   Plus they're right off the 202 @ AZ Ave, so it's easy to get to & from.  Stop waiting, get the help you need to be healthy & active again, HealthSource makes it easy.
5 I've had Dr. Donie for years.  Like Korina wrote, he is never condescending.  His bedside manner is excellent.  He knows a lot of specialists and at least in my case, has always made good referrals.  I can say that, although sometimes I can tell he's pressed for time, he never rushes.  Sometimes I have to wait a little while, but I KNOW that if I need a little more time in my consultation, he will give it to me.  He helped save my life by referring me to a good urologist after a physical and blood work looked suspicious.   He's also helped me try different medications for blood pressure until one worked without unpleasant side effects.  I never dread going to see Dr. Donie, and I recommend him to friends.
1 Over the last year the office has been getting REALLY shady. I'm talking "random" drug tests EVERY TIME you come in for a perscription refill! Then they charge your insurance $400 for the drug test! They code the bill to suck the most out of your insurance that they can! Also, last time I went there, I made a stink about the drug test and about how it charged my insurance so much. The girl took me into a back room away from listening ears in the reception area and told me I could just pay $20 on top for my co-pay and if the results come back negative, they will just through away the results. I went down the street and found a better doctor. You should too!
5 I met with Dr. Hamilton recently, and was so impressed with both his knowledge base and his compassion. Unlike most "western-trained" physicians, Dr. Hamilton wants to understand the complete picture of your life: your diet, your exercise habits, what stresses you out, and other basic things that western medicine often ignores.The result is that he can customize his treatments to fit your particular situation, and target the causes rather than just the symptoms of what ails you.  All the while he is listening attentively and non-judgmentally, and is absolutely determined to help where others have failed. If you're tired of doctors immediately reaching for the prescription pad, refresh your faith in the profession by seeing Dr. Hamilton!
5 I'm now 4 weeks post total knee replacement surgery and working with Ben at Mission Physical Therapy has been incredible!  The place is clean, the staff professional and polite and Ben is extremely attentive to my current needs and pushes me as far as he can with minimal aggravation to my knee.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for good PT!!
3 Be sure to ask if the person doing your checkup/assessment is an actual doctor or just a PA. This is in no way meant to belittle a PAs work but the PA I had today had no clue what was actually going on with my knee. When information provided negated what she thought was going on she finally brought an orthopedist in to look at my knee and I was finally given an actual answer as to what was wrong. Very thankful Dr. Liu stepped in and was thorough in checking the PAs work/'assessment' of my knee.
4 See my review for Diagnostic Center of medicine.  I LOVE Dr. TJ! But I really dislike the front office staff. They always come off rude and like they are missing parts of their lives.   I arrived for my 2pm appointment at 130 because I am a new patient and had to fill out new paper work. When you walk in, you have 3 Windows to choose from. They have the doctor's name above each window, and you are to check in at that specific one.   I wait by the window, and one lady and I make eye contact, and she walks away, saying nothing. This window was the last one on the right. The woman in the middle was sitting, and the one in the first window to the left was on the phone. After the phone conversation, the two ladies have a fun little talk... And I am still ignored.  Finally, the woman in the first window sees me after the woman in the middle announces that she is going to lunch. I am informed that the woman who belongs in the 3rd window is gone. Whatever.   I give her my insurance and my ID and she makes a copy of it while I sit and start paper work. While starting paper work, my cards are brought to me by the office worker, and I am called back before I finish the first page of my information.  Why do I have to be here half an hour early to fill out paper work, when I am called back for vitals, and weight before I complete the packet ? I filled it out while I was waiting for Dr. Terry M.   The appointment was quick and painless.  Dr. TJ always is on schedule! The longest I have eve waited for him was 15 minutes! He takes his time and addresses any of my concerns and makes me feel like a priority.
1 spoke with manager after the appt. her name is Melisa she is very disrespectful an treats clients like a customer at a convenient store. they are only their to take clients money an perform XRAYs an MRI to get the cost up. they made me wait almost 2 hour before even getting seen once I was seen I was their getting my knee pulled 7 different directions til I couldn't handle it anymore. after about 5 mins of paid they tell me pay 300 for a MRI after I just paid 300 for a xray an vistit I told them what I can do to help my knee they said STAY OFF OF IT was the only advice. then the appt was over., these people are pure money hungry an don't seem to help anyone that is in pain at all they have horrible customer service an I really wish people would take 5 mins out of their day to put their reviews up of this place so we can get it out of our community I live in Rhodes ranch an we deserve to have a good knee doctor an employees that really care about wjat your going threw not just treating you like a ATM until their next customer  thanks Melisa
1 Horrible place with such old equipment and careless rude people in it, better off finding a better place if you want to get better and keep your mind at peace...  The oc department doesn't care about your well-being or progress...They do care about their 5 minutes massage times to not go over even by 3 seconds which was the only thing they were sticklers about.  Horrible waste of time.
4 I've been going to Cornerstone off and on for a few years now and they've always been accommodating and wonderful to work with. They offer a good range of services to help you address your issues, including Pilates and Massage Therapy.  They even have a student rate for Ryerson students which made it very affordable for me when I first started going to the clinic. Another convenient aspect about Cornerstone is that they have two locations!  I've been seeing Marcia as my physiotherapist since the beginning and she is great. She employs a variety of techniques such as acupuncture for her treatments and is a great communicator. She also suggested that I see Anne a couple of times a week for Pilates to help with muscle strengthening, which has been awesome. I recently also started to see Matthew for massage, which I've also been really enjoying as part of my treatment.  I've come a long way since when I first started going to the clinic, but it's taken a long time to fix what I needed to fix. If you have the insurance and patience to see it through, this clinic is for you.
1 Still not happy with this place and can't find any other place that accepts my insurance...tried to make an appointment, didn't happen! I see about 8 different doctors names and not 1 of them is available? Plus, staff are pretty rude here and that doesn't help either! Really wish I could just see a REAL doctor for the benefit of doubt at least...I guess I'll just suck it up and put some more icy hot gel on my knee and hoping this pain will go away...would've been nice to know what I have but, I can't never get an appointment
5 The care, compassion, and support I have received from Kachina Family Practice has been wonderful. They have put health care in a positive light. The staff is friendly (they remember who you are), Dr. Fischbeck is patient, attentive, and open  minded.  He listens to his patients and works a plan with you to get you on a healthy path. Getting an appointment is convenient and wait times are minimal.  It is a great advantage to have an onsite Sonora Test Lab so you can maximize your visit. I have been a patient here for over five years and could not be more pleased.
1 I'll make this short and sweet. I will never return to this office again! Highly unorganized! Good luck to anyone who decides to go to this place especially if you are waiting for them to call you with the results of any sort of tests they may have ordered for you. Be prepared to call several times and leave several messages with no call backs and excuses that they are in meetings. Your best bet is to pay them a visit and get in their face. That's what I had to do to get the results of my chest X-ray and that is the last time I will ever set foot in that office.
5 She is a very professional and well-trained.　The purpose of going to Las Vegas is to go to her. She is so strong and very nice person I've ever met:)
5 I've been seeing Dr. Patel since 2002. He has always been helpful, listened well and given good advice. Sometimes he recommends just over the counter vitamins to help with issues and sometimes prescribes but it always is warranted. My husband started seeing him and now my 6 month old goes to him. He has yet to do us wrong...though I will say the person on the phone has been short with me a time or two, but i do not believe in bringing his review down as a doctor because of someone else's bad day.
1 I have been going here for years and ever since they moved to a new building, the service has steadily gone down hill.  I called to make an appointment and was on hod for 12 minutes before I was able to speak to someone and they answered the phone asking me to hold?  Again?  The receptionist, Tonya, was unprofessional and rude.  When I entered, she told me to sign in and have a seat.  Ten minutes later and still not checked in, another patient came in, went to the desk, and was immediately checked in!  When I was finally called, I asked to speak to the office manager.  I was explaining to Tonya what my concern was and she ignored me and asked the person behind me to check in.  I walked out of their office and went to Urgent Care.  Gilbert Family Medicine has horrible customer service and my family will be going elsewhere for care.
5 Dr. Kyle gives great adjustments, and is overall an excellent chiropractor. Very knowledge and takes the time to explain things other health care professionals would not. Definitely recommend him!
5 I was recommended AZ Manual Therapy by my orthopedic surgeon and I can see why. I had Richard as my therapist but they all seem good. He spends a lot of time one on one with you, which I was surprised about. I had rotator cuff surgery and three months later and it feels great but I'm still working on strength now that I have range of motion.  Obviously I still have to take it easy but the recovery has been very successful. I normally don't love physical therapy but I didn't mind going here.
5 Highly recommend.  They are profession and caring.  They are quite busy so it's better to book a few weeks at a time to get the slots you want. My main therapist was Kyla and she was ahhmazing, I had to sub a few times with Elysha & Rose and they were great as well.  Dr.Gri, naturopath, is pretty fantastic too.
1 Wow! This place is incredibly unprofessional! This is my third time being here. First time was with my grandmother and it was a pretty pleasant visit, but then once it was my turn things turned for the worst. I came in thinking I was getting an MRI done, but apparently it was for an XRAY, miscommunication I suppose, that's fine.  But what pissed me off was when the doctor called me back to go over the imaging results, she basically told me there's nothing wrong with my injury and that it healed itself within 6 months time.  WELL HELLO?! If it healed itself and I'm A OK, then why am I back and my physical therapist and primary doctor requesting for an MRI?  This doctor completely dismissed what I had to say and basically told me it would be a waste of time for me to go get an MRI and didn't recommend it.. A week later, I went against what she recommended and got an MRI anyways, and my PCP called me telling me I had 5 different diagnosis from my injury, so of course naturally I request to come back here to throw it in this doctors face. So now I'm back, sitting in the waiting room after I came in and went to the check in counter, only to be ignored for 5 minutes. I was  literally standing there, just so some chick in glasses, a side braid and a black lady could talk about labor and how women after giving birth get checked out of the hospitals super quick nowadays. Of course they finished their conversation before even acknowledging me, and when side braid asked me what I was in for, it was like I was an A HOLE for coming in to check in.
5 Dr. Or is very knowledgeable and caring. I highly recommend this clinic cuz of the staff and great Doctor!!!
5 I was a new patient and they created a nonexistent spot for me with Dr Frye the next day. The nurse took me in for vitals, on time mind you and less than 30 seconds later this guy walks in and introduces himself as Dr Frye. "That's weird" I thought. Usually there's time to read a novel before the Dr makes his appearance.  Promptness is just one of his excellent attributes.
5 One stop medical care!  The Church Wellesley Medical Centre is a special place for me. My family doctor, Dr J. Goodhew, is located in this space. What is different is now I don't have to travel all over the city for my fundamental medical need.   Located in this medical centre are Family Doctors, Specialists, a Walk-In Clinic, Dental, Physical Rehab, a Pharmacy and Optometry. What more do you need?   Recently I injured my back pretty badly. Dr Goodhew introduced me to the Clinic's Chiropractor Dr Sohil Shafiei DC. Together they came up plan to rehabilitate me and manage my pain.   I'm looking forward to my next in-house step. Dr Sina Shafiei D.Pod.M for my Orthotics. Also, since my introduction to the CW Health Centre I've moved my Optometry and Pharmacy over.   Again, one stop medical serves!
5 Love this office!  They have helped multiple members from my family over the years with different issues.  The entire staff is super nice and willing to help with anything I need.  I love that the treatment is individualized and that the staff works with  me on what will help me get better.  They take the time to answer questions and make sure you understand.  I recommend their office to everyone I know.
5 I would highly recommend Dr. Docasar to all my friends! She is always patient and takes the time to listen to my concerns. Office is clean and staff is helpful and friendly. I've never had a problem getting an appointment or experienced a long wait for the Dr. Can't say enough good things! Let's face it, Pap smears are not fun. Dr. Docasar always makes you feel as comfortable as possible.
1 Horrendous is the only word to describe my experience with this gym.  I have attempted to cancel my membership since February.  When I went into the gym I was given an email address.  I sent an e-mail and never received a response and have been charged every month since then for a membership I no longer want and am apparently unable to cancel.  There is no one I can talk to there.  Employees at the gym refused to assist me.  I just want to cancel my membership.  I wasn't even issue a new key card when the gym transitioned from Gold's to EOS. Never again will I consider joining this place again.
5 Was referred by a family member to see Dr Waltman's new office since I was told they could see me the same day, and didn't have to wait for 30 mins to an hour... and I wasn't disappointed.   Dr Waltman and his staff took great care of me, and didn't rush my visit going from room to room like my "old" Dr's office.   Thank you Dr Waltman and Canyon Pointe Heath!
1 DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME.    There should be a button to select for TURN AWAY AND RUN.   The physician's assistant is arrogant and has really bad breath, he does not hear what your issue is but rather put you down in a condescending way, and the nurse staff is rude.  Clearly the staff is unhappy with their jobs or they would make you feel at home.  Not the case.  The wait time is more than a half hour for lousy service.
1 I just called to make an appointment with Dr. Brown because I had read great reviews and a receptionist who obviously hates her job answered and I asked if he had any appointments available and she said "he's not here today". I replied "okay...well do you know if he has anything open this month?" and she replies  "HE'S. NOT. HERE. TODAY". Unbelievable behavior, needs to be fired immediately.
4 I'm a new patient and the dr I saw (Dr. Simpson) was kind, knowledgeable and overall gave me a good sense that she knew what I needed and how best to help me with not just this but all of my medical needs. The office was clean well staffed and well laid out, because I just moved to this side of town and I had a generally good experience I will come back and consider moving my families medical needsto this office. One thing to watch out for is the chatty receptionists who couldn't wait to talk about me as soon as I sat down. I'm willing to overlook this once but not twice.
1 There is something seriously wrong with Dr. Noel Chamian. On several occasions i witnessed him verbally assault patients in the waiting room. Tonight he called my home for the sole purpose of yelling at my 19 year old daughter, all because I called his office on her behalf while she was going through a crises. I was in his waiting room on the day he threatened to call the police on a patient who simply could not understand why he was being turned away for being 5 minutes late after the office changed his appointment time twice and he accommodated them. That was the second time I watched him blow up at people in his waiting room and tonight he called my house and did it to my daughter. I have never written a yelp review in my life. I usually do not agree with slamming a business if your experience was less than perfect, but in this case I have made an exception. I would want to know if a doctor is unstable, and I believe this one is. All of these things I have witnessed have taken place in the short 6 months we have been seeing him. STAY CLEAR OF THIS DOCTOR!
5 Christi Lee saved my life, literally! I love this office and all of the staff. Stephanie at the front is always friendly and knows me when I walk in. I would highly recommended this office and I have to many friends. If it wasn't for Christi and her amazing medical skills, I might not be here writing this.
1 They've got a good doctor but everything else is horrible. I thought I could put up with it and found out quickly this is not the place for me.  (1) Wait time: if you get an appointment anything after the 1st appointment, expect wait time to be around or over an HOUR. Yes, it's ridiculous. Want to try to get the first appointment of the day aka at 8 a.m.? I still waited for half an hour. Not great if you have a job to go to at 9 a.m.  (2) Professional staff: I mean UNprofessional staff. They don't greet patients at their station, loudly chitchat among themselves, their manners are sorely lacking and I've seen patients holding their charts for 5 mins waiting for them to be done bantering. Seriously?!   (3) Bare minimum: If you're expecting a nice diagnostic room, you're going to be disappointed. The only things that were in my room were three office reception chars, a sad fake plant and a examination table. What happened to medical posters, computers etc?  Now the doctor there is very caring and kind. So that's good. But unfortunately that's not enough for me to go back to deal with everything else.
5 This is the best doctors office I've ever been to! It's always so hard to find a new Doctor and I hit the jack pot with NSFM! Yesterday was my first visit and everyone that works there is so friendly and nice. I saw Dr Brewster who was friendly attentive and to the point. He gave me a thorough exam and patiently answered all my questions and refilled my perscriptions. The most amazing part of my visit was the fact that my appointment was at 11 and I was done by 1140! I've never been treated so well and so quickly by a doctors office. 5 stars isn't enough! Great staff great Doctor and great lab tech. Thank you NSFM!!!
1 Waited for over an hour and a half to be seen, only to be told they couldn't do the bloodwork I needed because I wasn't fasting. I was never told I needed to be fasting. Very unprofessional behavior and didn't really listen to what I needed.
1 Went for minor throat symptoms. Was prescribed prednisone (a steroid). When I got home and checked the bottle, it was labeled cephalexin (an antibiotic) and had someone else's name! Turns out everyone got the right pills, but my bottle had the wrong label. So not as bad as it might have been, but still an unacceptable mistake. Doubt I will use them again.
1 If your time isn't valued, and you believe the Doctors time is more valuable than your own, then this is your office!    Asked to show up 30 minutes early, actually get there 40 minutes early.  Then 85 minutes later I'm still sitting there waiting......And don't forget about the 30 minutes to drive there, and 30 minutes to get back to your day.  You will quickly spend TWO HOURS TWENTY FIVE minutes of your time in hopes of seeing the doctor for 20 minutes.  I'm sorry my time has VALUE too, and the doctor's time is no more valuable than my own.  I walked out after waiting 85 minutes........  Thanks Dr Erik Dean, you should work for the Cable company and make your appointments for any time between 8 AM and Noon...
5 Gorgeous and Wonderful staff!. Always wiling to work with my schedule and even gets me in last minute! I enjoy coming here.
1 My dear mother has been seen at the Tenaya clinic for general care. Now she has to have surgery and has waited over a month to have it performed. The day before surgery she was told that there was a "heart irregularity." In the days leading up to the scheduled surgery she has had literally dozens of tests. But, apparently they either never performed a stress test or an EEG prior to the surgery date.  I went with her to one appointment with Dr. Ang who wondered if my mom could touch her toes! And, she barely discussed the horrific rash my mother got as the result of the contrast dye when she had a CT scan. Finally she got around to discussing the 14 cm tumor and a referral for surgery.Since then my mother has had nothing but the run around having her jump hoop after hoop.  Caremore is a scam on older Americans. They bank on seniors dying rather than giving them appropriate, timely care.
5 I feel inclined to write a review simply because I feel Dr Gorfinkel is well above a 3 Star rating. Furthermore, although the only down-side may be waiting times....we live in a country with FREE HEALTH CARE and high volumes and high wait times is part of this package. If you are pressed for time, then I would highly recommend booking an early appointment, as the wait times are less. Bring a book. Waiting isn't the most terrible experience you can have in this world.   All that being said, she's worth the wait. Very thorough, knowledgable, friendly, and to the point. She also practices what she preaches, feeling that preventative health is key to overall great health. I enjoy talking to her as a person and there is no 'rush mentality' to get you in and out as quickly as possible. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why the waiting room times feel longer.   Also, she has partnered with other Drs for evening and weekend appointments, which has been very accomodating. I've seen one other Dr she works with, and he was equally as great, again taking the time to understand your ailments and not just pushing perscriptions on you. I'll never need to go into another walk-in clinic again!  Count your blessings people, we have a great Dr here.
4 Could not get into my regular place so decided to check out Bodyworks. Had a great massage from Mike. My lower back was killing me...he was able to get out all of the knots yet made the hour relaxing except for this one complaint.  My only complaint was when I arrived, I was asked to remove my shoes. No problem. Quieter the better, yet I swear there was someone walking around with wooden clogs. Not sure why WE had to remove our shoes but ONE person was able to cause so much rackett. Turned me off a little, and totally ruined the relaxation aspect. I probably should have said something when I left but was in a bit of a rush since I had to rush back to work. That said, I will go back.
5 Dr. Milne and his entire staff are AMAZING!!!! My dad has been a patient of his for over 20 years and I have been his patient for almost as long (wow that makes me feel old). My dad has various health problems and Dr. Milne has been the only doctor in town that has been able to help. When you meet with him he actually takes the time to listen and you will never feel rushed. Luckily I am rarely sick so I don't need to visit Dr. Milne often but when I do he is is truly a miracle worker.
5 I've been to countless chiropractor in the past, Donnovan has twice now had be walking out with zero pain after barely being able to walk into the office. Amazing
5 If you need physical therapy this is without a doubt the place to go. Brenda is absolutely AMAZING. I saw more relief from 3 sessions with her than 3 years of massage therapy and chiropractic therapy combined. She knew exactly how to pinpoint what my body needed and worked my muscles, soft tissue and fascia. I literally walked out of there a new person. And, she sent me home with the stretches I need in order to keep my body in check. On top of that, Brenda works around my schedule. She even took me in at 7pm and worked on me until 830. When I needed to schedule an appointment I went through her directly, I didn't have to sit on hold for 5 minutes or deal with an automated system. Brenda genuinely loves what she does and loves helping people. I highly recommend anyone in need of physical therapy start here first, you will not be disappointed.
1 Horrible nurse practioner.  Space cadet.  Will not return.  Oblivious to how a medical professional is to behave.
5 Dr. Reed is awesome! I came in for a little discomfort in my back, and after a couple adjustments I felt amazing. From the time you enter the building until you leave you are in great hands! Great experience all around.
5 I've been going to this studio for 8 months, and I love love love it. The owner and teachers are awesome, and memberships are the best price you'll find. Each teacher is very different, so try each one to see who's more your style. I've seen major results (after having a baby last year) and love that each class is challenging, fun and offers a wide variety of exercises that change all the time. Eva is my favorite; she will kick your butt!
1 I have tried to be a patient here a few times. Leaving once, then almost again about 2 months ago and now I am leaving.  I find it is easier to get in and treated better overall at a clinic by the house.   I really like Dr. Wright. He listens, explains and is thorough. That said he is about it for the office in my opinion. I was sent to a specialist and many visits and $ later nothing and Dr. Truesdale never said a word (he was the referring dr). PA was ok until she diagnosed me incorrectly and I ended up at a clinic afterwards. Listening is key.    The office staff I have interacted with are horrible. Rude and no customer service skills what so ever. I was told one person was leaving so the problem should improve (they knew they had a problem), but today without going into great detail I experienced it again by 2 people on the phone!  Tried to talk to an office manger (they don't have one right now) and supposedly Dr. Wright was to call me back, but the attitude of the person 'helping' me was so offensive and against all customer service 'rules' that I said forget it and hung up.  It is unfortunate but I have tried, but am not going to give up being treated with customer care just to see this doctor.
5 This office saved my life. Several years ago I went in thinking I had bronchitis. Dr. Andrew's took chest x-rays and called me at ****6pm ON A FRIDAY NIGHT****to tell me to get to the ER right away as they were already expecting me. I was 29 years old and having heart failure. Dr. Andrew's wasn't even my regular doctor. Dr. Whitten was my primary care doctor for nearly 15 years. She has seen my through the toughest times of my illness. She is an extremely patient listener, she took every piece of information I shared with her seriously and treated it all as relevant, she is objective and compassionate, and she approached my recovery in a very holistic way. I was always treated with respect and compassion. I do not know where I would be without these two phenomenal doctors.
5 Dr. Casady has helped me with my lower back issues and showed me x-rays of where the pain was coming from and why.. They have helped me a great deal and have an extremely friendly staff !!!
5 I have had to use the ER at Boulder City Hospital two times in the last two years and both times had a really good experience. Both Dr. Meeks and Dr. Rollins showed a great bed-side manner and made me feel comfortable and calm. The nurses and staff were equally as nice. And I did not have to wait to be seen. I highly recommend the ER at Boulder City Hospital.
1 I wish I could give it zero stars. TLDR: If you want good care and don't want to wait for hours without being seen, look for another doctor.  This was our first visit and we showed up 10 mins before the scheduled appointment time so we can fill out our paperwork. We ended up sitting in the waiting room for almost an hour after the appointment time, then I asked how much longer we would have to wait. Shortly after we got taken back to an exam room. They did the normal vitals, then told us the doctor would be right in. We were waiting for almost an hour in that room. I asked the nurses again and was told the doc would be right in. We waited another 20 minutes, then we ended up leaving before being seen and got a refund.   My wife and I had our three-year-old and one-year-old with us. No one told us that we were going to have to wait two hours. The staff was nice, but were busy chit chatting instead of checking on us. Two hours without ever seeing a doctor is nuts.   When they refunded us the co-pay and gave us back the applications we filled out, the reception desk told us that this doctor is ALWAYS like that. He is SUPER late on every appointment.   WHY SCHEDULE APPOINTMENTS SO CLOSE TOGETHER THEN?!? I should have checked out the doctor on yelp. It seems that this is a constant thing. If you want good care and don't want to wait for hours without being seen, look for another doctor.
5 I have used the services of John and his staff after 3 different surgeries now and the treatment has always been excellent and the knowledge of John and the staff has always been great.  They leave you with the ability to continue on with the exercises at home once their portion of the treatment is done.    I would use this facility again if needed.
1 For some reason Pink P has highjacked my email and so I didn't notice until I had  posted, it is a mess, but I got it straightened out, that  acct is not accessible now.   I went to Foothills 2 times. The first time I saw Catlin for a couple minutes and a tech the rest of the time. See the other comment- my experience was the same as hers! Caitlin was fine, but the long time and dealing with tech was not cool. The second time my appt was with her, but she was not there so I saw a guy named Jeff. While he is a fill-in, you do not know who you will see there, they didn't call to change my appt. So, while she did a tiny bit of massage, which helps, this guy just pulled, shook and twisted my arm, it was hurting a lot more, right after. I told the tech it was really bad and couldn't even do most of the exercises. He said he would tell Jeff, who NEVER came back over to see me, ask how I was, nothing! So, on my way out I cancelled all of my upcoming appts and called and spoke with the guy that the therapists report to- supposedly, but who knows. He said he would mention it and send a note to my doctor. I told him the most important thing is to address the issue with Jeff. I don't need a note to my Dr, I can take care of finding another therapist. Very upsetting, it has taken 2 weeks for the pain to calm down to where I was when I started there! That is not why you spend time and money going to therapy!
2 The office is small and there rooms are even smaller feels like you are in a broom closet. Dr. Boor seemed so full of himself The know it all attitude was just to much for me. When I explained my symptoms his answers made no sense. I went to another PC for a second opinion and they knew what was wrong almost instantly. I would not return to this office or would i recommend him to anyone. Only reason I gave 2 stars the front staff and nurse are very pleasant.
1 Doctor will not treat pain I came in with a gash in my leg was extremely painful had to be refered to a wound center and doctor didn't listen when I told her that the tramadol doesn't work for me she just said "I won't give you a narcotic and walked out" I'm no drugie but I deserve to not be in pain I have insurance for that reason simple fact the doctors moral dilemma with narcotics may leave you in pain I would go someplace else
2 We really wanted to like this place, but just ended up with issue after issue. First of all, let it be known that they have a loyalty plan that rewards people for good reviews on their Google and Yahoo listings. We did the complimentary initial consultation plus the two discounted adjustments. After the consultation they presented us with an $1800 treatment plan for three months of work and seemed surprised and puzzled when we didn't just automatically sign on. Dr B was wonderful and sweet, but the initial adjustments were pretty quick and generic. Also, they billed my insurance for what was supposed to be a free consultation and $25 adjustment. Ended up costing me $45 out of pocket and my insurance another $150.
5 Great clinic with hours that make sense. Great for urgent care, but also truly a family practice environment where you can take care of all of you health needs like check ups, shots, and the like.
1 Die Unfreundlichkeit in der Notfallambulanz könnte man noch akzeptieren wenn sie sich nicht mit der Unfähigkeit eines behandelnden Jungarztes kombinieren würde.
5 Dr. Goldberg is a great guy and even better doctor. I value everything he has to say and really appreciate the time he takes with me during my appointments. The office staff is great and they always squeeze me in when I need to be seen, whether it's with Dr. G himself or one of the NP's. Overall I've had a great experience with this office and would recommend Dr. Goldberg to anyone!
5 This establishment is OPEN! Please read on....  Stopped in @ QC  Reflexology for a treatment session and discovered that they are under new ownership and are in the process of changing the name to AJ Reflexology.    My initial thought was "uh oh!" That pleasantly turned out to be an incorrect assumption by me. I can tell you this, the outstanding customer service and high quality level of massage treatments, remains the same.   Former owner Linda introduced the new owner, Angela, to me. Angela provided me with an outstanding massage to treat my arthritis using the right amount of pressure and was very sensitive to my request not to use too much pressure. Thank you for that Angela!  Also, all the former employees have been retained and the prices are similar.  So, I'm glad that I won't be looking for a new place. Whew!
5 I have been getting massages from Traci for many years and I follow her where ever she goes.  I even moved out of state but came back just for her wonderful massages.  She gets to the area of pain and works it out.  You WILL fell like a new person after a massage with her.  You must go to Rx Massage if you are in pain and want relief.  Thank you Traci!
5 My back pain has decreased dramatically since going to regular visits here.
5 I've gone to multiple urgent care centers before and consistently have had pretty bad experiences. No one typically wants to be working, so staff is rude. Wait times are usually terrible.   I came in on a Saturday afternoon and was greeted in a pleasant manner by the receptionist. Was in and out very quickly and the staff were professional. This experience is what I would expect from all urgent cares. Even though this location is not close to my house I would come here if I had an urgent care related matter again in the future. Thanks for the quick and friendly service.
5 Unusual for today, Dr. Medeiros is (almost) always on time.  He takes all the time he needs to do the job.  Has no problem referring.  He knows that he doesn't know it all.  Refreshing!  Not sure he is taking new patients.  If not, so sorry.  He is a keeper!
1 STAY FAR AWAY!!!  The Front Office Manager is the WORST business person on earth!  He is down right mean to the employees and to the patients.  He is rude and acts like a complete A**-H***!!!  I've been a Botox patient for many years and they used to be good when Alicia was doing it but now it's terrible!  I am going to a different place to have them fix my face!  I look 50 years older after my last Botox appointment.  If I could give zero stars I would.  They have a bunch of very young inexperienced staff who are completely afraid of the manager.  He yells at them and at the patients!!
5 I have had a number of massages with Helen, she is always excellent and responsive to requests and discussion about body issues I am having at the time.
1 Stay Away from this place, I just witnessed the most unprofessional treatment of a patient, I am in complete disbelief of the events that unraveled in front of me. I met my significant other there for her appointment, she arrived 12 minutes early I got there on time, she had called ahead to confirm that her appointment was on time knowing that she had a sales call 2 hours later. we waited in one of the many rooms to be seen, about 30 min goes by and the door doesn't open, she sticks her head out to ask how much longer it would be and they did not know, we got the line"he is with other patients". 5 min later a guy in a football jersey walks in to talk with us,some kind of assistant, no tags, nothing, he is not the doctor we find out, she explains she has been sitting in their office for 50 min and wants to be seen by the doctor because the steroids he put her on are not helping with major skin irritations, shes suffering and it obvious. The football jersey guy says " this is medicine we don't know how long it will take each patient and that this is probably not the office for you", cant make this stuff up, now remember she called 15 min prior and confirmed there was no delays. she asked to speak to the doctor and he said the doc would be in in 5 min, 5 minutes later 2 women walk in, no uniforms, ones in old jeans and again an old football jersey the other i don't know what to say, it was surreal, they tell the patient they have a referral for her and they don't want to treat her because they felt she was being rude. We/ she never saw a doctor, was never told how long the wait would be and we sat there for over an hour like we are supposed to expect this treatment. I think this place is a front for something else something is not right. look at the other reviews. I am trying to get my spouse into Carmel Family Phys, but the doctors there are not taking any new patients, you know why, because they are awesome and they care.
4 Lymphatic therapy is a place I had to come to during physical therapy for my leg.  I had no complaint about them at all.  I didn't have a bad experience any time I came here. They did lots of good work in getting me healed, The two therapists I worked with were  absolutely wonderful. The front staff is very nice, I had no issues with scheduling and they always kept me well informed. Also, one of them wore glasses and was major eye candy and thats certainly going to get you more stars in my review  The only negatives about this place is that they're the only lymphatic therapy in town, so that can be a drag. They're also located in a very tiny and nondescript parking lot, so unless you know that its there it'll be hard to find on your first visit.
5 Auden is a phenomenal massage therapist! I see him every month, sometimes twice/month. He's gotten me healthy and ready for all my races and long runs. Love it and highly recommend it!!!
5 I had experienced various other physical therapy business in the past for myself and with my kids sports injuries. Based on those experiences I had a very low opinion of physical therapy until now. I just had major reconstructive surgery and I told my doctor my opinions of PT so he sent me to Pam. I am so thankful he did to! She is extremely knowledgeable, she is hands on and gets results. If you expect results, don't want to waste your time and money then this is the place for you!! Pam is truly the BEST!! I have had limited exposure to the other therapist but I believe if they are working for Pam they are highly qualified, professional and friendly.   I have only ever written one other review on a business but use Yelp to find businesses and professionals. I want to help others who are needing serious help. You wont be disappointed with this group of professionals.   Thanks for all your help Pam!!!
3 I bought a Groupon for a massage and it was worth the discounted rate but nothing special. It was my therapists second day on the job, so that could be part of the reason for my 3 star massage experience.   The facility is nice and as long as the price is right (they are checking my insurance) I'll be back to give their other services a try.
4 Professional service and staff who actually want to help make you feel better. What I mean, is they will try to explain what might be happening, recommend stretches and even give referrals to other things that might be helpful.   This is a no frills place, it's not like going to a spa. You may hear the streetcar below and you need to trek up a flight of stairs. So in that respect I gave it four stars. I know therapeutic massages do not need to be a super elegant place - but it's a nice added bonus when your paying to get a massage. It is clean though.   On the other side, the work they do, ease of making appointments, and location make this a great place to go to see a RMT.   I hear the owner however is only available during the day, during the week, which is too bad. I heard she's good with TCM.
1 I have been been here 3 or 4 times previously. Staff is always nice, waiting area and exam rooms are always clean.  However, wait times are always about twice what I am told upon arrival. Today, I was sent home from work because I felt and sounded terrible. I stopped off at this urgent care at about 8:10 am.  As usual, the wait was endless. A few people got up and left. Then, BAM! A gentleman who had also been waiting to see a doctor comes out of the back and announces there is no doctor there. Several of us still waiting went up to the receptionist and got it out of him that the doctor was on her way from Tempe. This is after I had waited an hour and a half. I was told it would be about another 45 mins until she arrived. Needless to say, most of the rest of us waiting formed an angry mob and stormed out of there. I will NEVER go back there and will make sure my friends and family know that this place was not honest with me when I went in seeking care.
1 people Be forewarned.. Terrible experience.. Look past the niceness of jennefer and you will see she is a liar.. I have been a patient there for over a year and doc rogers has me on test injections which i desperately need  as my levels were dangerously low.. Jennefer said she has contacted my carrier .. blue croos/blue shield to get prior authorization as the medicine is extremely expensive  and i asked jennefer 5 times to please  yes thats right 5 times i called to make sure she was following through the prior auth to keep my costs low as i cannot afford to pay what i was paying..I finally called my insurance and they told me there was NEVER ever A RECORD of her calling and trying to get this pre approved. In short she boldly lied to me..Doc rogers is also very short with his patients,,rushes you through,, and would not even explain the   cbc blood count results to me he just said it all looks ok...., not the kind of doctor i want.. See past the friendliness  the bottom line is how are they with their patients in taking care of them,  follow up is horrible,, and look outside the box and you will see that things are Not as they appear.. I wish you luck with this office.. I  have switched. thank god and good riddens Philo
5 I recently started experiencing back and pain and chose Mountain Park Chiropractic from the list of providers on my insurance website and I'm glad I did!  I was nervous because I had never been to a chiropractor before (and generally avoid doctors anyway), but I began to feel at ease when I called to make my initial appointment. The staff are all incredibly friendly and personable and Dr. Picarello is great. I was able to get an appointment the same day I called, the hours are great (I don't have to change my work schedule), and I never have to spend time in the waiting room - my appointments are always on time and efficient. Dr. Picarello used my x-rays to identify my issue and showed me stretches that would help. I've also really benefited from the ultrasound and IFC therapy. I would really recommend this practice as all the staff have such a sweet attitude, they genuinely care about your well being, and they make appointments as pleasurable as possible.
5 While planning my mini birthday  vacation I searched for a Watsu practitioner in Las Vegas and found  Margoa Relaxation.  I had a Watsu  treatment at Margoa Relaxation with Rotem. He is a patient, intuitive and nurturing therapist who individualized my session according to my needs, abilities, and limitations. The treatments are done at a private location in an outside, warm-water pool.  I absolutely loved my experience and plan to return.
5 Ich hatte sehr große Rückenschmerzen durch die fachmannische Beratung und Behandlung durch Herrn Zintel waren die Schmerzen schon nach kurzer Zeit weg. Mache jetzt wöchentlich eine Massage und das tut mir gut. Sehr zu empfehlen, weiter so und vielen Dank. Gruß Norbert Rebmann
5 The staff here are outstanding!! Very friendly and feels like a family atmosphere.  Jacob, you rock!!!
4 Four stars because dr White is a great doctor. The only bad thing we can say is they never answer the phone when you call. If you leave a message they don't call back most the time. I have to go to the office to schedule appointments for my daughter. We have been taking our daughter to dr White for 7 months now and continue to go there only because of him. We wish he would fix the problem with nobody answering the phone. They just expanded the office so maybe it will help with wait times.
5 Eric and his team at Impact are miracle workers! After about a year of having knee pain I finally decided to do something about it. After my first visit at impact my pain was reduced significantly. I highly recommend investing in your self and checking out Impact Physical Therapy.
1 If being a nice guy was the most important part of being a doctor, Dr. Tsai would get five stars.  Instead, he has to be judged on how he helps you medically.  The blood tests he ordered for me were so inadequate, that a specialist I was seeing for gout had complete new tests run in which only a few were related to him.  He couldn't believe how little Dr. Tsai checked for.  If you have an issue and to in to see Dr. Tsai, his usual response is what do you think?  Well, I think he has five more years of college education than I do and is supposed to know some, if not most of the answers himself.  I changed doctors and the new GP had me going through a battery of tests because Dr. Tsai.  An issue was uncovered and preventative steps were initiated to end the problem.  By the way, Dr. Tsai doesn't take blood so you will need to go to a lab and waste additional time there.  My new GP takes the blood in his office.
3 I only went to this hospital because it's the only place my doctor delivers babies. Love my doctor, so I followed her there. This was baby #2 for me, so I stayed home during labor as long as possible. By the time I made it to UMC, I was in transition and ready to push. My husband ran into the lobby to get someone to bring me in because I could no longer walk. No one responded - he came back out to the car on his own with a wheelchair. I told him "heck no, I need someone to help me now!" He ran back in and no one would help him still, so my mother went in and YELLED in the lobby for help. Someone finally came running out, helped me into a wheelchair and quickly wheeled me up to the delivery floor. A security guard locked the elevator so it'd go straight to the 8th floor without stopping. Thank you!  When I got to the delivery floor, nurses started yelling "stork! stork!," which I (correctly) guessed meant a woman who is going to deliver right now. On my way through the halls to triage, I was asked by so many people what my name was. My contractions were so close together, I couldn't talk very comfortably so after the third or so time answering the same question, I just closed my eyes and ignored them. That was a little unorganized, especially since I was pre-registered and since my doctor had JUST called them to tell them I was on my way and in full blown labor.   Young female doctor in triage was great- wish I could remember her name. I squeezed her hand HARD. I delivered less than 30 minutes after arriving at the hospital; if I had to be there any longer I would not recommend it. The recovery room was one of the newer ones. Nothing fancy, but not disgusting. Summerlin was so much nicer. The nurses at UMC were nice, but Summerlin was definitely better.  The food sucked at UMC. They had no vegetarian options, no food available at nighttime for moms who deliver in the evening. I was starving and my husband had to get me a terrible bean burrito at the fast food place down the street. The shower was no good. No place to sit down for the first post-birth shower.  We had a tour months before. The staff assured us that my 6 yr old daughter could come meet her new baby sister in the hospital, but apparently someone totally lied about that. I was so surprised when they wouldn't let her up at all. They should've been honest about that.  Thankfully, I only spent the pushing stage of labor at UMC. My doctors were great, but if I had to spend any longer there, I don't think it would've been good.  It's OK but if you have a choice, I'd go to Summerlin or another less ghetto hospital.
5 Dr. Katibah is by far the best physcian I have been too. He cares about your needs and is there to help more than just prescribe you medicine. He gets to the bottom of your underlying issues. I have seen him three times and I have not waited more than 5 minutes to see. He generally cares about his patients. I recommend him to any person. Not over priced. Staff is nice. Gets you in and out in a timely manner. I rated him 5 out of 5 stars because there's nothing that needs to be changed about this practice. Keep up the good work!
5 I've been taking prenatal yoga classes from Casey, Founder and Associate of this healing and wellness company throughout my pregnancy, and it took me until today, the day before my due date, to take Casey up on her offer to come in for a prenatal massage session.  Needless to say, I should've gone in sooner.  The office is a hidden gem, located just north of Indian School on the east side of 32nd street.  I parked in back and made my way up to the door where Casey was waiting for me with a cold bottle of water... nice touch!  Since I'm very pregnant at the moment, Casey worked on me first in a special chair that allowed room for my belly and then on a table that had just enough foam pillows to keep me comfortable and relaxed.  Her healing touch was amazing, and the time I spent there flew by.  Rates are extremely competitive, and first time clients can take advantage of an introductory massage for just $45.  In addition to Casey, there are three other associates, and they are available for appointments from early morning through evening 7 days a week.  They do all kinds of massage ranging from deep tissue, relaxation, energetic, prenatal, and more... they also specialize in working with corporate wellness - I know they keep busy with some large companies in town.  If you're looking for a massage from a skilled professional, you can't go wrong here.  Enjoy!
5 When I go to a Dr. Office I expect a lot, working in the dental field I know what my employee expects from me and I want the same service and that is what I recieved at this office. Carrie was amazing with a question on a bill I had.  She did not just sit there and say call billing I do not know. Lynn my MA was so friendly and nice and made me feel very comfortable. I wish I remebered the nice Dr. Name but very friendly answered all my question I never once felt rushed. If you are looking for a Dr. Office that treats you like you just walked into Nordstroms this is the place to go. Thank you for such a wonderful experience.
4 My husband got recommended to this dental from a coworker and at first I was apprehensive because we live 20 minutes away, not too far but not a close drive either. I went on ahead and set up an appointment to go in anyway needless to say I'm super glad we did. Such a clean cute office with very friendly staff! I love everyone there they really are nice and answer all my questions when asked. I'm pleased with my dental work and I plan on driving 20 minutes to go to Wonderful Smiles from here on out!!
1 If you enjoy rudeness from the lead physical therapist, this is the place to go.  This little guy made himself small as it was clear he didn't like not being the smartest person in the room.  I hold four degrees, three in psychology and one in seminary.  I am in a PhD program and am a distinguished MS graduate and I am in Who's who.  Why write this?  Simple; one never knows whose company they are in and this physical therapist who I will not waste typing time to put his name is clearly a racist.  We went on a recommendation from the esteemed Dr. Jason Garber.  This PT even degraded Dr. Garber's recommendation.  Nerve.  Very unethical. Anyway, without looking at my wife's MRI's, this guy proceeds to tell her that she is not very injured and is not in that much pain.  Then proceeds to make a PT plan.  As a scholar, I questioned what the plan was and this little smug individual looked to the left as to decide whether to answer me or not.  Of course I called him on it immediately questioning why he has a problem answering questions regarding my wife's care.  He backed down but the unethical damage was done.    When you become too smart for people smarter than you, and you choose to be passively aggressive towards potential clients, you have a problem.  He says he is moving his small practice to Henderson.  I say small because he does not even have a real traction machine lol but he has a huge ego.
1 So my appt was for 5pm they said be here 10 mins prior I was, they called me back and I've been waiting for 50 mins now ! This is horrible ! Don't schedule patients if you can't handle the work load its simple
1 This is supposed to be a new office, but they've got old technology and the service is from the dark ages also!  Take your insurance money elsewhere.
5 I have had different types of massage: reflexology, shiatsu, rmt,...everything was amazing  The staff is great, the ambiance super relaxing, it is clean Highly recommend
5 I have been experiencing discomfort in my back for months since I work an office job. I have been struggling to find a great massage therapist to ease the tension in my back. I was recommended to Step Up and their massage therapists were AMAZING! I can honestly say that my back has never felt better! =)   All of their staff from chiro, acupuncture and massage therapists were really nice and knowledgeable. They even teach you stretching to prevent sore muscles and bad sitting posture which we're all guilty of at work.   It's my go to place for all my benefits esp cuz its right in the heart of financial district, can even go during lunch. Plus they are open early mornings to late nights, 7 days a week. lol they even direct bill so I don't have to do anything but relax.
5 I am very satisfied with the level of care I received. The PA-C was professional, warm, and thorough. The nurse was efficient. The receptionist was the only drawback. She was neither friendly nor helpful. Not unpleasant, just not warm and not in any hurry. She never communicated other than saying Good Morning in a monotone voice. I really liked the convenience of the in-house pharmacy. Overall, a positive experience and I would visit them again.
5 I was in a car accident in March 2017 and was referred by my attorney. For the first six weeks I was coming 3x a week. The staff was very friendly and called me by my first name and made me feel like family. The pt's treated me with the utmost care they understood my skin condition and took extra steps to ensure that I was comfortable every time I came.  Dr Yang was awesome, he knew exactly what was needed to be done in my recovery process and it was done effectively and effortlessly.
1 I thought very highly of Dr. Campbell until the second time he gave me an epidural for my left leg. The surgical center was overwhelmed with the number of patients that he had on the schedule. Other than the delay, the procedure went fine. BUT, the next morning I was in pain. I called his office, and they said he would get back to me when he was done with his current patient. A couple of hours later, I called the office again. With the same response. After waiting another hour or so, I called his office and I was told that if the pain continued I should make an appointment to see him on Monday (this was Friday). I then called my GP who had referred me to Dr. Campbell. He called Dr. Campbell's office. With no response, he directly texted to Dr. Campbell's cell phone. NO RESPONSE. So I was left to suffer. Never heard from him or his office.   A pain doctor who won't respond to his patient in pain. I don't think so.
5 I've seen Dr. Tamara Hefferon and a fabulous PTA named Uche! The two of them took the time to understand my goals for therapy and returning back to competitive running as quickly and as safely as possible. I felt like the center of the universe during treatments and even received follow up calls and texts from the front desk to check in on me. Phenomenal place! I've referred a handful of friends and family members without any qualms !.
5 Putting the cryotherapy aside And just based on experience, customer service and quality of my time spent there this is the place to go. On top of that the cryotherapy is instant relief for tension, pain and stress. Angelo has a lot of passion for this and helping in keeping your body energized and helping it recover.
1 Horrible experience.  I have a migraine today, asked for deep tissue on shoulders neck and upper back and this therapist hasn't got a clue how to relieve a headache or even give a good massage, my worst experience ever and I have had numerous massages over the years.  I thought the whole experience from the moment I walked in was not good, and the therapist  was late, needless to say I didn't go back to work after this experience which has cost me time and money now.  Just plain horrible!!!
5 I was looking for a new family doctor after moving about a year ago, and have been extremely happy with all of the staff here.  The quality of care from our new family doctor is excellent!  The pharmacist, Sonam, definitely deserves a shout out; she is very friendly, personable and is always very helpful when we have questions.  Definitely the best customer service I have received at any pharmacy!  P.S. - My wife and I love the complimentary McDonalds coffee :)
5 So my boyfriend gets his physical therapy here after he got his acl and mcl replaced, Pablo is the nicest guy ever all of the staff is so nice and polite and supportive! I reccomend this place to anyone in need of physical therapy!
5 Hands down one of the best studios I've ever been to. The studio, instructors, yogis are friendly, welcoming and come in all varieties. They know what they are doing and have fun while practicing to be well. I heart them.
5 The receptionists were friendly and efficient. The waiting room has a variety of chair sizes and heights. Dr. Sanders and his medical staff had excellent bed side manner. He was very thorough in explaining all of our options. The cast tech did a great job casting my mom's arm.
3 So far im waiting in er. 90 min or so. Sick people puking in their portable puke containers.  My husband was going to puke as he noticed a girls portable puke pocket getting fuller so we moved. Now we have front row seats.  Let the entertainment begin.....
1 Rude staff. They lost my paperwork and then required me to jump through hoops for my visit, requiring a doctor release although I prior treatment with their office. I left having wasted my time.
1 Long wait time. My appointment was at 1030am  and 1.5 hours later, i havent seen a doctor. So i finally asked how long the wait time is as i have errands in an hour. The front desk told me there was one patient ahead of me and they couldn't guarantee that ill see a doctor in an hour. What a waste  of time going there.
5 This place is amazing they really do care about your recovery!! Scott is the best physical therapist. I would definitely recommend this place to anybody. The staff is amazing as well. Wouldn't want to go to any other place than this.
5 Great, relaxed atmosphere with an optimistic vibe. You can tell that their number one priority is to make you feel healthy and stay that way! Julie is enthusiastic and very well informed, not what I'm used to at most doctor's offices, which is a fantastic change!
1 Dr. Jerry Shockey is the WORST doctor in Mesa and probably in the entire state. He is rude, arrogant, insensitive and uncaring. I took my mother to see him and he talked down to her and to me.  He prescribed some medicine and when I asked if there would be any interaction with any of her current medicine, his response "I don't know, I guess we'll find out"  My only regret is I didn't tell him what a jackass he was to his face!
1 I have never ever been so angey at a medical place like i am with this terrible place . I get a call from mike at referrals tells me i missed my appointment. I tell him i didn't get a call then he checks says tour right we didn't call .i get to make a new appointment for the next day in the morning at 10:30 am i get there then they say i have no appointment till next week then they say its at the Glendale office. REALLY i walked out im looking for a new dr. I called mike and well of course he never said my appointment was the next day in the morning. REALLY LETS LIE TO PATIENTS MAKES ME WANNA PUNCH SOME ONE mike STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE PEOPLE HERE DONT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING AND THEN LIE WHEN THEY MESS UP ...IMAGINE HAVING THEM PERFORM SURGERY ON YOU AND THEY TAKEN OUT THE WRONG PART ..YOU WOULD GET BLAMED STAY AWAY
1 I can't speak for the actual physical therapist because I have only dealt with them professionally for credentialing. The credentialing staff in provider enrollment that they have are very immature and unprofessional. They would always call with an attitude for information, and if they didn't like the answer they would hang up. Then, call back and if they got the same person they would just keep hanging up on them. They would make insults calling our Staff stupid, worhtless etc. I mean every time they would call no matter how professional and composed we stayed and whether they got the information they were needing or not it was like they had nothing better to do then act like children prank calling our dept. it was unbelievable. This happened at least twice a month the whole 2 yrs I worked there so it wasn't just a bad day/week for them it was constant.
5 At 43 years old I had I had to get a full hip replacement due to BMX riding and many physically demanding activities i enjoyed throughout my life. I came here and received awesome attention and great therapy tp help my hip. The excercises were very simple but effective and I felt the difference after the first day of thereapy. Rich Elsner and his associates are very pleasing and knowledgable to work with. After you've signed in you can just walk to the back with out waiting and receive immidiate attention. Pick this place first!!
5 I had some long time family friends refer me here. I'm a new patient at this facility under Dr. Kody Smith. I have to say after just one visit I feel extremely comfortable here. Everyone I came in contact with was super nice and knowledgeable. The doctor wasn't your typical type, to just get in and get out writing off a prescription. He took the time to listen to me and explain in depth everything that needed to be. I'm excited to call him my new primary care physician and look forward to being under his care. I've had a rough last year and have been extremely picky when it comes to doctors from my experiences. I have no complaints about him or this facility. Thank you!
1 The office manager is unethical, rude and incompetent. If you have an issue with your medications that they prescribed incorrect it's nearly impossible to get it fixed. You will never see the same Doctor, they cancel your appointments last minute and are never on time. I would not recommend this office or the providers.
3 I had an acupuncture appointment here & they are currently in a temporary space which felt very crowded & small. Anyway regardless of the space I had an hour long treatment and it was not what I'm used to. I get regular acupuncture treatments elsewhere but had wanted to find an acupunturist in the Yonge/Sheppard area. Esther seems very knowledgeable but she put the needles in me & left me to lie there for about 25 minutes. I felt quite bored, stiff and a little cold having to lie in one position for so long. Then after the acupuncture she did some cupping on me. But she used a machine to make the suction on my neck so strong it almost hurt. When she took the cups off my neck I had four bright red circles which took about a week to go away. The treatment did help with the issues I wanted addressed. Esther recommended twice a week treatments which seems excessive to me. Also I just wasn't comfortable during the treatments. At this point I'm not sure if I will come back or not. Still thinking about it.
1 We've been going to GCFFM for years. This is the final blow that had me searching for a new family practice.   I waited for an hour in the waiting room to be seen for my appointment. Once back in a room I had to wait another two hours, at one point they even had to move me into another room.  After three hours I walked out to the nurses station and told them I needed to be seen now or I'm leaving. With that a doctor came in and was very rude. He did not apologize for the three hour wait rather made it sound like it was my fault and I was impatient.   On a separate occasion I faxed over documents for my sons appointment and the receiving nurse threw them away. Fortunately, I had brought the originals and they were able to make copies.   Over all, this facility, including doctors, staff, and nurses are very rude, unprofessional, incompetent and I would never recommend anyone going here. Urgent care is faster and the experience is way better.  Shame on you Gilbert Center for Family Medicine.
3 Good doctors the waits aren't too bad if you schedule ahead of time. A little bit like an assembly line and sometimes you don't know which doctor you're going to get. All in all if you're a healthy person and don't rely on the office visits too much it's not too bad
1 So many inconsistencies in the office procedures & business practices here. They tried to bill me for services I never received. When confronted,  they refused to remove the charges. When my attorney insisted, they removed some but not all of the fraudulent charges. They billed for 2 ultra sounds, I only received 1. At each of the 12 visits, they billed for my chiropractic adjustment,  which I did receive,  and 3 extra charges for stretching and workouts on the machines.  I never stepped foot on any of the workout equipment. Each visit lasted a total of 10-15 minutes. Not even close to the three 30 minute sessions they tried to bill me for. A total of $3500 of fraudulent charges. They agreed to remove a total of $2500. Not good enough. I'll see them in court. Very dishonest.  I would recommend that everyone treated here scrutinize the billing very carefully.
5 Dr Faylona is the best there is, the best there was, and the best there will be!!Lol Kidding aside, Dr Faylona has more than 18 years of experience as a family doctor. Straight forward but devoted to patient care. Office staff are very efficient and can speak many languages like Filipino, Spanish and English. They also perform Blood draws etc. in the office so thats saves us a lot of time waiting and traveling. Busy doctor so make an appointment!! Tell her Rick James sent you. =)
1 This place is ridiculous. Why does it take so long to go through here? I was here 2 weeks ago for a pre employment drug test. Well they lost it and waited until yesterday to notify my new employer. I can't start until this is done. So I have to go back today to redo it. They wouldn't let me make an appointment for this, did not apologize once for the trouble, and have kept me waiting over an hour just to pee in a cup. Never ever go here if you can avoid it. Oh and some of the chairs in the waiting room have blood on them. When I notified the front desk about this they told me I could stand if I preferred!!
5 Was suffering from persistent pain that I was not able to completely get rid of after seeing others.  Kevin took the time to listen to my history and symptoms and gave a massage targeted to fix my problems.  After the massage he told me what to expect and gave me some stretches to do.  After nearly two months of pain and inactivity I am extremely happy the pain is gone and I am able to exercise again.  Thanks Kevin!
5 We moved here about 3 years ago and I needed a doctor for my family. I love this place. The office staff Julie is awesome. Morgan Watkins is the PA for Dr. Burrell. I usually see Morgan. I can't say enough about this practice. He is a very kind, considerate and thorough person. I never feel rushed and the nurses , the lab tech are just outstanding.  They care enough to not just make you a number .  I trust them and I know that they will do all they can to help solve whatever health crisis that I may be having . (Which I usually have something)    Wait times are never excessive and it's a very clean , tastefully decorated office.
5 The wait time was very long however it was due to only having one doctor able to work on children.  Once we were seen by the doctor it was an amazing experience! Her care, service, bedside manner and genuine concern were second to none.  We did a follow up consultation with our regular doctor the next day and even she was very impressed with the work performed.  Thank you for all u do!
5 The ladies here were A-MA-ZING! So friendly and explained everything before I even had to ask.
1 Dr. Vazquez was so, SO rude. I should have walked out when I heard the way he was talking to other patients, I left the office almost in tears.  To top it off he told me he couldn't help me, he didn't specialize in what I needed, yada yada. I told the front desk explicitly what I needed to be seen for when I was making an appointment, so why would they still schedule me?  Wish I could do more than just write a bad review. Avoid this place.
5 I have now been to the clinic for two different problems and both were addressed expertly within 2-3 visits. Sai conducts a very thorough work up to assess the problem and in both cases, her insight enabled me to know what movements/sports to avoid or not avoid. I like that she advocates movement and staying active. The clinic is well organized, has access to parking and runs on time. It's also a nice space filled with nice people. You can't really ask for more. Reasonably priced too.
5 I have been coming here for 10 years and they are so friendly and helpful. Dentist is great and the staff are too.   Now my mom started coming here too and loves it.
5 Steve is fantastic at what he does, every time I visit Continuum Wellness I am amazed at how he can feel whatever is out of balance or needs fixing, and maybe find something that I never knew was there!  I absolutely love that the staff works together with you, they all know a little about you and help in whatever exercise or treatment that needs to be done.  These guys seem to have a different outlook on what care is and getting you back to life,  it is working really well for them! This is by far the best physical therapy place I have ever been to.
5 I must say that the care my father received here was better than anywhere else in the city.  To notch everything.  The people are great and very caring.  Your loved one will be in great hands here.
5 I'm new to this practice but they are friendly and very helpful.starting the diet program
5 I've been coming here for a month now and I love it. Dr Turner is great and she gives a fantastic adjustment and awesome advice. I have high standards for my chiropractic care since I grew up with a grandfather, uncle and cousins who have practices. Unfortunately for me they are all in TX so I'm so grateful to have found this place! Deanna at the desk is so friendly and helpful. And the therapy ladies are wonderful too. As an added bonus the office is super cute! Thank you all!
5 Best physio in Toronto. I have been seeing Adam for years and wouldn't consider anyone else!
5 Dr. Ben Palmer is professional, knowledgable and takes great care of all of his patients. When you walk into his doors he always makes you feel very welcomed and the most important person during the appointment. He takes the time to listen to concerns and makes the best treatment plan to get you back to healthy or to keep you healthy. M1 Movement and Therapy is about the the clients needs every time. This is a fantastic physical therapy office with an incredible staff and owner.
1 People who giving good comments to this spa are relatives of the lady who runs it. Don't be fooled its a pathetic environment, the lady didn't tell me she will charge me for facial. She charged 135$ for nothing , she didn't even touch my face it give me a massage. I feel they are racist . Don't waste ur money ,there are much better spa than this.font be fooled by the knowledge the spa owner has , u can Google that stuff.
1 This place is the worst. Everytime I have an appointment, I have to wait at least two hours past my appointment time to be seen. You don't even get taken back to a room until nearly an hour after your appointment time. They lose papers, constantly make clerical errors, and most of the receptionists are extremely snotty. I absolutely would not come here if they weren't the only place in my area that takes my insurance AND has late hours. I dread my visits. If you absolutely have to come here like I do, make sure you bring A LOT of things to entertain you.
1 Horrible waiting time. Reception really does not give a crap...no wonder they don't have that many patients...its ridiculous...   Waited for over an hour, no doctor attended to my situation..people just keep waiting for Nothing here...   Unbelievable...how bad the service is.. if you can't take so many patients than don't take them... why make ppl wait forever and not being attended to...
1 I have gone to SE Valley medical for apron 6 yrs. The NP that I always saw has retired. He was wonderful. I then had the misfortune to be seen by another NP several times.  Some people just should not be in the medical profession. I don't think she can handle anything more than a common cold.  I have had to find a new primary care facility. If your looking for an NP with experience, empathy, intuitiveness then keep looking. Stopping here could be a waste of your time...something you don't need when you're not feeling well.  I can't speak about the other NPS in that office only that this one was hired.
5 We have been attending speech therapy for a year, we have seen a huge improvement with our son. Kristina his slp is so great! She truly has been instrumental in not only get him the proper diagnosis but guiding our family to help him with his apraxia. Everyone here has truly been great and so caring and helpful. Even the other parents/families here are super supportive,we give each other support and progress on the kids and how they are doing while we are in the waiting room. Now Shasta at the front desk is just so sweet, so caring. Check in is truly like you're catching up with a friend and you happen to be there for an appointment. Always so happy to see you and knows us by name, hey when your here a few times a week it's bound to happen. Rescheduling appointment when needed is a breeze we try not to as that is best for our son but kids get sick and life happens so they help us reschedule and pick up makeup appointments as they are available. We have had a great experience with all our visits, he recently started ot for his sensory disorder and it's really been making life easier and Lisa's and her student have the ability to pass on their knowledge so we can apply it at that home. Where we are no pros at this it has been easy and with paperwork reference is great! Again I know everyone's needs are different but we are so thankful to have such a great team of caring professionals helping our son and family though this journey!
1 I was really looking forward to my massage because of all the great reviews. Sadly I was very disappointed. The setup is very basic, no frills which is fine but expect to not be able to really fully relax because of the thin walls, slammed doors and voices outside the room. Reception could be friendlier.  My massage therapist completely missed all my sore back spots. When he did find them, the technique was so poor,  I felt no relief of my upper back tension at the end. I honestly couldn't have been more disappointed. Not going back.
5 I got my very first treatment a few weeks ago. I was nervous but Dr. Ngo was great - very friendly and professional and guided me through the process. I felt amazing after the session. I would highly recommend!
5 Cozy listens to her clients needs. She makes suggestions for what type of massage would meet their needs and then lets the client choose.   I have lived with chronic pain for several years. My pain increased after flying to Las Vegas. I explained my situation to Cozy and she suggested I allow her to use her Ortho Bionomy techniques. I'd never heard of it before but gave it a try. At first I thought it would not help as the techniques involves very slow movements and did not think it would help me to relax and have less pain. I was wrong. Ortho Bionomy is an amazing technique that I will request in the future!
1 I was recently searching for a new primary care physician and was referred to Total Wellness by two different people so I had high expectations for my visit. I scheduled my appointment but then come day of, I arrived and was informed that the doctor was exposed to something and had to cancel all her appointments. I was completely content with that as I understand things happen outside of their control so we rescheduled for 2 weeks from then. During that initial visit I got a feeling of unprofessionalism in the way the staff spoke to me and each other but I brushed it off and left.  The morning of my next visit I called to confirm my appointment since I didn't receive a confirmation call only to find out that my appointment hadn't been reschedule after all. The receptionist said I could come anyway which was kind so I headed down. When I walked in I waited in a short line to check in then began filling out my new patient paperwork in the sitting room. While I was completing the forms I couldn't help but listen to the TV that was set to a channel equivalent to Star magazine with its celebrity gossip and inappropriate banter about cheating spouses and other mind numbing topics.  After filling out the paperwork I waited for 2 hours before I finally had to leave without getting seen to make it to another appointment. I understand how busy doctors are but not once did any staff member apologize for the long wait time to me or any other one of the 10-15 patients who waited an equal or greater amount of time than myself. Even a small gesture like this can make the world of difference in my experience.   Upon leaving I called to let them know I wouldn't be able to wait any longer. When asked if I wanted to reschedule I said no and mentioned that I was disappointed with their customer service thus far. Their response was an indifferent "okay, bye."   My search for a family doctor continues, but I certainly do not recommend visiting Total Wellness.
1 went in to the ER last night because of pain and discomfort due to bilateral sciatica (caused by a shifty disc in my back). i have been told by so many doctors that they can't really do anything for me insofar as treatment goes, but usually i end up with a prescription for a benzo to keep the pain away. now, with the new 'war on painkillers', i can't even get pills to relieve my suffering (patients have the 'right to not be in pain' my fucking ass!). they explained to me that the pills i need are on some sort of retarded "no prescribe" list, and that they couldn't help me. so, no treatment AND no medication to help me deal with my condition. what the hell use are medical professionals who will neither treat you, or give you medication!!?? they told me that prescriptions need to be through my primary care doctor (even though the last time i went to this hospital, they prescribed me zanax so obviously they are either full of crap or have no consistent policy). we just moved from california to arizona, and it takes time to switch medical insurance over, and choose a plan/doctor. it will likely be weeks until i am able to get a primary care doctor's appointment, and in the meantime i am without care.  thanks for wasting my time, and not doing a damn thing to help me with this horrible medical issue that has been torturing me for 5 and a half months. you people are far more interested in following your stupid protocols, policies, and covering your own butts, than you are in alleviating pain or treating people. not to mention, your attitudes and bedside manner are seriously lacking in professionalism and compassion. PEOPLE IN PAIN NEED PAIN KILLERS. this war on prescription pain killers is really taking a toll on some people who really need them.
1 Switched over to Saguaro Family Practice and both experiences with Dr. Dwivedi have been the worst experiences of my life. I had gone in for an MRI and blacked out and had to go to the emergency room. They told me to go to my primary care doctor so I went to see Dr. Dwivedi for my first time just to let her know what happened so that she could document it and maybe suggest why I blacked out, etc. She didn't care at all. She told me to just go back to the MRI place to get the test finished (obviously). She said it was just a weird thing and she didn't know why it happened, even though I mentioned to her that I black out often.   Now I just went back today for something completely unrelated... needed a referral for a dermatologist. She accused me of lying, saying that they have no records that I talked to her about the MRI or blacking out. She said I never had my results sent over, even though I did. And all of a sudden it's a huuuuuuge deal that I black out often, when she didn't care at all before. She refused to give me the referral for the dermatologist and told me if I wanted it, I would have to come back in 4 weeks after seeing a neurologist and cardiologist. If I wanted the dermatologist referral in 4 weeks, I would have come in 4 weeks.  This place absolutely thrives off the number of times you come in. They will make you come back for every little thing so that you have to keep paying, and in the end tell you that they don't know what is wrong with you and there's nothing they can do. SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.   PS... she said that she was "not at all concerned about me or my safety" and was only worried about me blacking out because I might hurt someone else if I black out while driving... even though I told her that I only black out after standing for a long time, never after sitting.
1 Had an annual physical check up couple years ago, paid my co-pay but received $250 bill from them.  Saying my insurance didn't cover part of the claim.  My insurance premium is pretty good so I was shocked to receive the bill.  Called to schedule an appointment yesterday.  They said they need my credit card information so they can add it to my file.  Just in case if any of the claim that my insurance reject, they will charge to my credit card.....It is really RIDICULOUS!!!!  DONT GO THERE!!!
3 I know I should be a better advocate for my own health, but I honestly didn't think about it at the time since I was so tired and horribly ill, but when I told the nurse that I was "late", maybe they should have run a pregnancy test before push three different prescriptions on me? I had sinus, ear and throat infection which actually turned out to be bronchitis and the nausea turned out to NOT be one of the prescriptions, but my Doctor back home informed me I was also pregnant.
5 They really know what they are doing. This is way beyond simple chiropractic. Great doc, great staff.
5 As a nurse I am super picky about what doctors I will go to but Dr Mitch, Np Melissa and all his amazing staff have pretty much saved my career. I hurt my back lifting a patient a couple years ago and was in such pain all the time and was actually considering leaving bedside nursing. I am so grateful to them and now feel like I have my life and career!
5 Dr. Guilford and her staff are Amazing!  The treatment has provided relief to my daily discomfort.  Each visit is an uplifting experience, from a practice that treats you like family, to the way you are greeted upon your arrival.  Dr. G not only explains what  she is doing, but why.  I felt a decade younger during the first month.
5 Fantastic staff, they care about helping you get better. A well-rounded physical therapy clinic, they incorporate science-based myofascial release techniques with individually tailored rehab programs to get you where you want to be.  I especially like the hands-on approach (literally!) they take with each patient.  You aren't a number here, and the therapists will work with you and adapt their treatment depending on your progress and needs the day they see you - not blindly holding to a plan developed at the start of your treatment.  As a sports enthusiast, I was also pleased to learn that they play competitive sports themselves, and have experience with sports-related rehab.  Both my knee and back concerns have been addressed, and while I don't hope pain or injury on anyone, if you have it, you should try them out - they'll take care of you.
5 I have seen Pam for a couple of issues and she has always been able to make a big difference.  I most recently had treatment for a shoulder impingement.  When I started seeing Pam, I couldn't open a jar without pain (how exactly my shoulder is involved with opening a jar it a little obscure to me, but trust me, when I was trying to open a jar, it hurt my shoulder).  Now as the end of treatment, I am pain free and back to my normal activities of swimming, weight lifting and jar opening.  I was impressed that when you go to Orthopedic Therapy and Wellness you are treated by a physical therapist throughout.  At other physical therapy offices I have been seen and evaluated by the physical therapist, but then the bulk of my treatment has been done by a physical therapy assistant, or a physical therapy technician.  I highly recommend Orthopedic Therapy and Wellness and will be going back any time I need further physical therapy.
1 Horrible.  I will never go back, even though it seems all the doctors around here refer there, I always tell them "Anywhere but Core". I don't want to make this long, though I could. Just one short example as to the quality of care -or rather, the lack thereof.  I went in on a pre-scheduled appointment. I was actually relieved to have had that appointment because a very specific new back pain had cropped up the day before.. Dr. God, oops, I mean Rene Lucas rushed in, felt my back standing up for about 5 seconds, said I was fine, and rushed out. By the evening it was unbearable, so I went to the ER. Turns out I had a serious kidney infection that required hospitalization.  If a doctor can't diagnose a kidney infection, look out. That's actually dangerous. Who knows what they are not or under or erroneously treating. They should have zero or minus starts
5 Dr Hudson is awesome, he does a great job of getting you back to level, even after one treatment you feel ten times better. You never have to wait and get gets you in and out quickly. His location is convenient as well, right off Indian School and Miller.
5 I went in with hip bursitis, and was in a lot of pain, but they used a miracle wave machine, and some other treatments, and my pain is gone!  I thought I would have to skip tennis for awhile, but now I can play soon.  Scott Pensivy and his staff were wonderful!
1 Girls at front desk are rude and short. Make you feel as if your business is not welcome. Appointment was at 10 on a Thursday yet was still not on time. Will not be returning.
5 I have bad pain at my lower back, neck and shoulder from too many business trip with economy class and desk work. Aya-San's massage was painful but felt relieve and good. I am living in LA but it worth to go every 2-3 month.
4 It's such a great feeling to really trust your Dr.  Even if you only go once a year, it's nice to know what to expect.  After having my last two awesome Dr's retire on me, I found a great Dr that I've followed to 2 different offices and through about 6 different insurance companies.  Whew!    While their last waiting room was more warm, this one has lots of distractions, which can be even better I suppose.  There is a tv going (I've seen it generally on talk shows and news channels), lots of seating, a good amount of magazines and some stuff for the kids.    Once inside, you can see that each Dr has his/her own space within the office including separate stations for their P.A. The best thing about the old location was that if you needed blood work or an xray, you just had to walk down a hall.  As of last time I was there, you had to go downstairs for blood work, but I was told they are looking to soon have both in their same office again soon.  You have to love one stop shopping - even in a Dr.  All of the Dr's at the office have been great.  My main Dr, Dr. Veronica Lindo went to part time a few years ago so I've seen several other Dr's in the office, though Dr Smith the most.  My girlfriend thinks it's awesome to actually have a young black female doctor as it makes her feel so much more relatable.  I love that they are so informative, friendly, and willing to make sure you understand what's going on before rushing to the next room.
5 Amazing staff, comprehensive care, and "educating your body" - these are the three things that pretty much sum up my experience. I started seeing Dr. Meyers for back and neck pain associated with sitting at a desk all day. Not only has Dr. Meyers been able to relieve pain, but  her and her staff have been extremely helpful in pinpointing (and correcting) posture issues that create the pain in the first place. I would highly recommend Dr. Meyers for chiropractic care and her massage therapist (Cecilia is amazing!) for massage work!
1 Where to start??  I went there after hurting my leg. I arrived on crutches we had on hand and in a lot of pain and the front desk staff had me stand there filling out a bunch of paperwork. After that, they kept calling me up to the front desk for more information, payment, etc. You would have thought they would have noticed that I was hurt and was having trouble moving around and either offer me a chair at the desk or come out to the lobby to where I was sitting for the information. There was practically nobody there, so they can't use that they were too busy as an excuse.  Then I am brought back and a weary-looking nurse comes in and says something like she'll be my "health care provider" for the visit. They send me back for x-rays and I return to the examination room. A while later she comes in and says she doesn't see anything wrong. So they don't even have radiologists reading the x-rays and the nurses do it there. She asks me to try putting weight on my leg and it's excruciatingly painful. She frowns and says that isn't good and walks out.  I think she's going to go get a doctor, as in an M.D., to check me out. I sit there and wait and wait and wait for about 15-20 minutes. But nobody comes back. Finally I hobble out to see if I can find someone to see what's going on. And I see the nurse practitioner sitting at a counter, seemingly hanging out talking to another worker. I ask what's going on, and they shoo me back into the examination room and say someone will be with me in a bit. Again, I think a doctor is on the way.  A while later a medical assistant comes in with a brace and an order for an MRI. She says it'll probably take me two weeks to get in for an MRI, and until then not to put any weight on my leg and to wear the brace. Well, the brace doesn't fit and I can't stand up or sit down without any help. She seems unphased.   She has me sign some documents saying that I've been seen and hands me a bunch of documents including the MRI order, a prescription for pain medication that I never requested, etc. and sends me home.  When I get home I go through all the documents and it says that I have potentially serious injury that typically requires surgery! Yet they send me home?? And the documents that they had me sign say that they explained my diagnosis to me and that I understand it!   I eventually get in for an MRI and it reveals that I do have a fracture. I go to see an orthopedic doctor and bring the x-rays that took at Urgent Care Extra, and the doctor sees the fracture and even points it out to me.  At Urgent Care Express I never saw an MD. I don't even think one was there. They don't have radiologists reading x-rays. And they send people home with fractures.   Welcome to modern heathcare.  So if it matters to you, before going to this or any other urgent care you should ask if you'll be seen by an M.D. and if you need x-rays if a Radiologist will be reading the x-rays.
5 I go the Apache Junction office. I finally found a great doctor. Dr. Gage She actually listened to me and actually seemed to care. She discovered a big mistake my prior Dr. Had made in my prescriptions. She seemed very intelligent, and for the first time in my life, I didn't feel like I was just a number. Thank you! I'll be back.
5 Sweet Relief...finally!  I have had chronic, debilitating sciatica pain for close to a year and kept putting off going to see a pain management doctor. I assumed I would be placed on meds and I don't like taking pills. I had my appointment with Dr. Wu a little over a week ago, had my transfoaminal epidural spinal injections(s) at an outpatient surgery center and I feel like new. I knew nothing prior of this procedure's success rates and am so happy with the results. He did an excellent job and I will gladly keep going to Innovative Pain Care Center, as long as I need it.
5 I just had another visit at this office yesterday (been going for a few years now) and after it, I definitely felt a need to write this review. It was such an easy, pleasant experience. THe front desk staff was nice. The nurse/back office staff member who took my vitals was one of the friendliest people ever and Dr. BarrettoKo was so attentive, like always. Whenever I see Dr. BarrettoKo, I always feel like she is actually listening and hearing my concerns. Sometimes it is hard to get in to see her but it's definitely worth the wait.
5 I went to foothills for back injury ,Jonathan did a great job and I'm extremely happy with the results. he is defiantly one of the best Physical therapists that I have worked with. thank you :)
4 I had a great session today, felt very relaxed and opened. Tammy was very conscious of the time to make sure that her next client wasn't waiting outside, I think after reading some of the other comments she is trying to make up to it. She took her time to explain to me how the crystal healing works and walk met though the process of the healing session. I believe this stuff works so I will book more sessions with her and let you all know how it goes!
5 In a nutshell... If I could stand outside my body and give myself a massage, this is exactly how I would do it.   This office is clean, smelled good, had prompt service, minimal paperwork to fill out, easy parking and nice newer tables with good padding.  My masseuse, Andrea, read my body and was able to work out my knots with just the right amount of pressure, without any if the mystical nonsense that other masseusses do, like when they fan away evil spirits and waste your time. This girl was all business.  Another thing I liked about her was how she didn't compartmentalize my body and seemed to be everywhere at once. Don't know how she did that, but at times, it felt like there was another masseuse in the room.  I have been to a lot of other places, and when I find someone I liked, I would stick with them. My last masseuse in Hawaii, was my go to for years. I think Andrea is even better than her!  I highly recommend checking this place out, and I will be back!
1 After contacting them, I have been through all the loopholes of getting an approval from my insurance. Called to make my appointment to finally hear that they don't accept new patients. And they even hung on me when I asked what's going on. Agape physical therapy... not recommended.
1 If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I tried to set up an appointment with a General Physician here. I got into an auto accident where my health insurance is covered up to a year under the auto insurance.  I have regular insurance but already sent over paperwork to have my ordinary insurance reject any claims that are a result of my auto accident. So even if I gave my ordinary insurance it would not work!   They told me "Sorry we don't take auto insurance. We don't know if we will get paid." I spoke to doctor and said they would because I have coverage that pays for it up to a year.   This place is a joke.
5 I've been a patient of Dr Moran's for many years. She is so caring and personable. I usually can get an appt the same day when I need quick care. Physician's Assistant Maura Tardif is probably the most caring PA I have ever met. She always helps and remembers you and what's going on in your life. Highly recommend.
5 JD is a great doctor. He has an easy going quality about him that you can relate to. The staff is very Pleasant. Thanks so much!!
5 My sister, brother and I joined this gym together and we absolutely love it! The staff is extremely friendly and the classes are really fun. Totally recommend!
5 Same day appointment for a new patient... Short wait time... Awesome staff... What more can you ask for?!
5 When I began taking lessons at the Pilates Center of Pittsburgh, my exposure to Pilates had been minimal, just some workout dvds. This was my first lesson in a formal setting with an expert and it made a huge difference in what I was able to get out of the workout.   I studied mostly with Leslie, who is a true expert at precision. Leslie is great at communicating Pilates concepts in several different ways, so that you can connect with an explanation that resonates with you.  That said, the other instructors are great too. Leslie is very selective about who she hires, you won't find instructors here that don't know what they are doing. I took a couple of classes with Sally and would highly recommend her as an instructor. She is extremely kind and bubbly, but don't let her fool you - she will work you!  At the Pilates Center, it is required for you to go through a series of intro sessions before joining a class. Having done it, I think that this is so smart. The intro sessions are well-priced, they give you one-on-one time with the instructors to focus on your specific needs and really ensure that you are joining a class when you are ready (a great way to prevent injuries).   The environment is very casual, calm and relaxed. This isn't one of those snobby or pretentious places...which is a major selling point for me. Don't think you have to be a fit and tiny ballerina to fit in here, there are students of all ages and skill levels.  Most of all, I love how Pilates makes me feel strong, open and energized. It's a great way to start your day if you can swing a morning session.
2 Since I have not met my deductable yet, I was trying to get an out-of-pocket price quote. I wanted to know what to expect when getting my bill, even if it was just an estimate. My insurance instructed me to call the doctor. When I called, no one at this practice could help me and the receptionist didn't even direct me to a billing person. She simply said "it is up to the doctor". This is a little frustrating as I did not want to be shocked with a big bill at the end (which did happen by the way).  I took the gamble and made the appointment anyway. Frankly, I was not overly impressed. I felt I was rushed through the entire visit and was basically just referred to specialists for very minor questions. I was also pushed to do a lot of tests that I felt were unnecessary as my issue was pretty minor.  The check-in staff is not very friendly and seem grumpy. The office is easy to get to but the area is pretty sketchy now.   In the end, I still have questions un-answered and a large bill that I feel was coded in a way to drive up the price.
1 I was experiencing an UTI and wanted to see a physician for a prescription.  I am a Health care professional so I know exactly what I needed.  I was told the wait would be 30-45 minutes.  I had told the receptionist and pharmacist there that I have to leave at a certain time to pick up my kids which was in an hour.  I waited and waited and was told that I would have to wait.  I told the staff that if I knew that it was not possible to be seen within the hour, I could have gone to another clinic.  The staff clearly did not genuinely cared and understood my needs.  I am very disappointed that I had wasted my whole hour, which I could have ran my other errands and my UTI unresolved.  It is never easy to squeeze time for oneself as a working mother and clearly this is not important for this clinic.
5 I've seen Doctor Young 3 times now. He is a great and knowledgeable. Everytime I've had an appointment its been a great experience. He and his staff  are very kind and helpful. He listens to my concerns and answers my question. I would highly recommend him to anyone looking for a Spine Specialist. They are amazing!
5 Thank you to all the team of the spa who gave me a real moment of relaxation . From the warmly greeted by the receptionist, encompassing care , intuitive and very professional massage therapist, everything was perfect! I had a 90 minute massage and the massage therapist was very attentive to my needs.  All in a zen and relaxing atmosphere , I really managed to relax. See you soon !
1 I signed up for the NASM guided study program. This program is filled with flaws. After paying and officially enrolling, I had a choice of 10 week course or 16 week course. The online sign up gave these options:  10 week course: 8/30/2016-12/13/2016 16 week course: 8/30/2016-11/1/2016  see the discrepancy there?  So I had to call to make sure I chose the right course! When I called, however, the customer service agent couldn't find me in the system. Turns out after calling twice before hand to change a misspelling to my name, it still had not been corrected (keep in mind you can not sign up to take the test with a misspelled name!). So I got those two things cleared up and waited for my book to arrive. The book (which is supposed to take 3-5 business days) took  two weeks to get to me.   What brought me to finally write a review is that I've now been on hold for 20 minutes to figure out which CPR/AED class we need prior to the exam (There is a first aid option and a regular CPR/AED course). This information is not made explicit on the online handbook. 20 minutes to get a simple question answered? no thanks.  I've been nothing but frustrated with NASM since the very beginning. My advice: Choose a different school.
1 Was a patient there for years. I went 3 years without a visit making me a new patient. Ok just needed a physical,they cannot do the physical the first visit. They do them the second visit. So 2 co-pays, 2 bills to insurance company. Why couldn't we do everything on the first visit? I told the women since I'm a new patient I'll shop around. She did not seem to care...so hard to find a family doctor these days.
5 I have had low back and neck pain for years from playing sports, I was referred by a friend to this clinic and it has been nothing short of amazing for me. I can not stress the level of concern they had for me the second I came in. The young ladies at the front desk always have an interest in how my treatment is going even when they are not directly involved in my care, I've never had that in another medical office. The chiropractor is always talking to me before, during and after my adjustment about what he is doing how I'm improving and what I need to be doing to keep my care on track. I had concerns about other areas of my health and the nurse practitioners really took the extra step and helped me get a grasp on my allergies which I have suffered from for years. I'm very pleased with my whole experience and I often refer my own family and friends to any of the Pain Stop Clinics because the level of care is something you can't get anywhere else.
5 I am new to arizona and needed a good family care doc. I have lot of issues and I am very particular about my doctor needs. I see doctor Norma perrallis. She is fairly young and vibrant. She takes good time with you. Addresses evry concern.leads you with solutions. Gives you comfortable options. She and her staff are polite and warm. I am sure she can be a great family doctor.
5 Back in Action Physical Therapists and administrative staff: Kinga, Chris, Andrew, Lori, Joel, Rachel, Mary, Darcy are ALL fantastic!! They listen, care, treat and do their best each session to help the patient find relief and continue at your next treatment to make continued progress. I highly recommend Back in Action for any ailment that you need professional treatment to get you healthy and back on track!
4 Warner Family is a well-oiled machine, which is good, they're very efficient, but it does leave it up to the patient to make sure he or she is seen and treated as an individual.   I've found it easy to get in for unplanned visits (as long as it doesn't matter who you see), but they book physicals (which they pretty much make you do on an annual basis to be seen for anything) way out.  The office was in walking distance of my first place when I moved to Chandler, but since then I've moved to North Scottsdale, but I still make the drive because despite some hassles, I do believe I get good care. Mornings are pretty crowded and you may end up waiting, but I've been in the mid-afternoon and it was mostly empty and pretty quick to get in.
5 I had reconstructive knee surgery about a year ago that has been in serious rehab, as well as some lower back pain. Prior to my first cryotherapy treatment, I had no idea what to expect or if it would even work. Other than the obvious fact that it is COLD, I couldn't believe what an amazing experience it was. The benefits blew my mind; my lower back pain is gone, my knee is less stiff, my mind is clearer, I have more energy. All this from one treatment. This is not even mentioning how amazing and informative Angelo and the office staff are. The office is relaxing, professional, and inviting. Angelo is extremely knowledgeable, and obviously passionate about his clients. I can not recommend him and this team enough. I can't wait to go "freeze" again!
1 Trying to cancel my membership with this gym because I moved to a different city has been an absolute nightmare. I was coerced into signing a year long membership after trying to redeem my Groupon. The Groupon I purchased included an "unlimited 2-month membership and 50 Wynn Bucks". The manager who was signing me up for this contract said I could redeem the 50 Wynn Bucks and receive the last 2 months of membership for free. I expressed my concerns that I was planning on moving during the year and was told this would be the best deal for me, since cancelling the contract would be no problem at all. I have since moved and tried cancelling my membership multiple times. I was told that the fee was over $99 to cancel before the contract is over. With only a few months left on my membership, I decided to wait until the contract ended. Little did I know I did not get the 2 free months I was promised and I am still being charged. I live far from this location and every time I tried to call to speak to the manager to cancel this membership, I was told I would have to set up a meeting in person. The hours that the manager was able to meet were weeks in advance during hours I had work. I sent a cancellation letter expressing my concerns and I have been called by different managers, yet charges are going through my account. Even after cancelling my credit card, they found a way to charge my new credit card.(which they charged triple for the "cancelled payments") I have followed up, only to be told they were "investigating." I would advise anyone considering signing up with this gym to understand that they will say anything to get you to do so!
1 Terrible. Came in for a walk in, waited over an hour. Agreed front desk is not professional and does not provide quality customer service. When I finally went to ask about the wait time, that receptionist never came back to answer. Asked the second girl, she finally says she doesn't know. Theres only one doctor in and she has to see ALL these patients. Wow, really? Why didn't you just say that in the beginning. I left.
5 I've had chronic pain in my upper hamstring for 6 months and have tried everything to fix it (including going to physical therapy for 4 months). I've seen Brandon for only 3 weeks and am feeling SO MUCH better! My constant pain is gone! Brandon is super friendly, he explained to me what was going on with my injury, how he would work on me to fix the problem, and told me what I could do at home to expedite the process! I highly recommend Brandon to anyone who is has excessive pain, tightness, an injury, etc!
1 First, I want to say that this review is only about Dr. Goldansky, not necessarily Arizona Primary Care Physicians whom he is affiliated with. I made an appt with Dr Goldansky for a physical. I arrived a few minutes early for my appt, and was told that Dr Goldansky was running a few minutes late. After approx 90 minutes of waiting (obviously not just a few minutes) I was getting ready to leave because I had a meeting needed to get to. That was when I was called back and put in an exam room to wait for the doctor. After a few minutes, Dr Goldansky came in, and I told him that unfortunately, since it had been approx 90 minutes from my appt's scheduled time, I had to leave to get to a meeting. Dr Goldansky asked why I had come in, I explained for a physical, he asked if there was anything else bothering me, and I casually mentioned that I got heartburn sometimes when eating spicy foods. He wrote me a prescription, which i never filled, and suggested to me that the next time I needed to make an appt, I should make it for 8:00 and then there would be no risk of the wait time.   Then, a couple of months later, I receive a bill in the mail for the visit. Dr Goldansky had billed me $150 for the visit. I found this odd, since I was in front of the doctor for approximately 3 minutes, and certainly didn't receive a physical. I called up their billing department to find out the details of the charges, since the purpose of my appt was a physical, and they told me that if I needed to dispute the charges, I needed to talk to Dr Goldansky himself. After a number of voice mails to his assistant, I did receive a call from Dr Goldansky. I refreshed his memory regarding the visit, and his response was that the charge was for an office visit, not a physical. Now, I am not in the medical field, but if I walked in to a place of business expecting one service, didn't receive it, was given something i didn't need/want (the heartburn prescription) and then later billed for that something, I would be confused. Dr Goldansky's response was, "why would you think my time (the office visit) isn't valuable?" Dr Goldansky, why is my 90 minutes of waiting not valuable? Why is it ok to charge someone for something they didn't need after they didn't get what they wanted in the first place? Since I still need to get a physical, Dr Goldansky had the opportunity to keep a patient by realizing the bogus charge, but opted for another approach. I paid the money, and left him this review.   I would highly discourage anyone from visiting Dr Goldansky in the future.
1 I have been a patient of Dr. Mody for almost five years and I will no longer be seeing him. I really like Dr. Mody and wish I could stay with him but the staff of his practice has made me decide to look for care elsewhere. They are unprofessional, unorganized, and flat out rude. This started when Dr. Mody changed from his old practice and moved into this new building.  I tried to get a refill called in from my pharmacy on a Monday and on Wednesday I called back to ask what was going on. I was told they were still checking it and would get to it as soon as possible. When Friday rolled around I called back. Peggy acted as if I was bothering them and said they would get to it when they could. It was finally called in the next Tuesday.  The next issue came when I needed to see a specialist for a check up after a surgery. After a week I called back to see what the hold up was and was told it was done and they would be calling me to schedule an appointment. After two weeks I called back and asked to speak to Dr. Mody directly. Debbie got an attitude and very defensive and told me that the physicians did not talk or call back patients and I would not be able to speak with him. She said the appointment person only worked until noon and would handle it. After two more days I finally got a call from the specialist to make an appointment for a totally different procedure. To get them to change it to the right procedure took another week! I now need to get another specialist referral and I'm stressed out about having to call and ask them so I have been putting it off.  It has become obvious that this practice has too many patients and cannot give the individual care that should be expected from a family doctor. This, coupled by the fact that the front desk and scheduling personnel are rude and incompetent has made my decision an easy one.  I hope this helps steer other future patients away from this practice.
5 The folks at Foothills Sports Medicine Physical Therapy are great!  Everyone is very knowledgeable and professional, yet they treat you like family.  I was a patient of theirs for five months while recovering from a broken shoulder and surgery.  My experience with the therapists and technicians is that they listened to me (and my body), and would push me just enough to get me where my body needed to be without overdoing it.  Collectively they have a great sense of humor, and are a really cohesive team.  The team was hugely instrumental in my recovery.   - W. R.
1 This was one of the most unpleasant doctor appointments I've ever experienced and will never return and hope to persuade other patients that this place is highly unprofessional and unfriendly and to not go here. Upon my visit I was looked down upon due to my age and the receptionist's behaviour was very horrible to me. I had to wait to see the doctor for what felt like ages in the medical room, and I was talked into a breast examination that I didn't even need. I'm guessing this was a way for them to make more money upon my visit. Also, I had brought a friend along who was waiting for me in the guest area, and he said the receptionists were gossiping about me. It wasn't until after the appointment that I felt violated and taken advantage of. I'm not surprised by the other bad reviews on here. The people that work here are cruel, including the doctor, and care more about making money than the health of their patients or treating people with dignity and respect.
1 Be prepared to pay out of pocket, in addition to your co-pay. This place got their $50 co-pay each session from me, and still wanted another $40 for months, until they sent it to collections. I guess they just don't make enough pounding your insurance along with the co-pays????? Well, apparently the PA office is hurting to get EVERY dollar possible!
5 Aya is an amazing person and an even better masseuse. She will tell you about any alignment issues and even recommend exercises to correct these issues. It was the most detailed 1 hour massage I have ever had. She knew all my tense and sore spots and tackled them with vigor. I highly recommend her services.
5 Reducing back and side pain is very important to my quality of life, so that I can continue a reasonably active lifestyle. I've been to physical therapy at least 5 times in my life so I have a feel for what is important. I did quite a bit of research for finding the best physical therapist for me in the Mesa area. I even had a paid evaluation done by another physical therapist who had the kind of credentials that I was looking for. However, I really desired to have more 'active' involvement by the lead DPT in my regular treatment. Then I found this place, where the lead DPT, Eric, had better credentials. It was clear that he would be actively involved with my treatment. I have been there for 4 sessions and I am extremely impressed with his knowledge and skill. I'm so glad I am going there! I'm already seeing some improvement, and Eric keeps adjusting the treatment and exercises based on what he detects in muscle checks and my reports on my issues during the time between appointments.  Eric is the best!
3 The massage was ok. When the therapist left the room so I can remove my clothing she disappeared for 20 minutes then came in and said I cut my finger so I will have to wear a rubber glove. Imagine how uncomfortable an oily rubber glove would feel on your skin. She started 20 min late but the massage ended on time.
5 Dr. Pinto seems to be one of those few doctors out there who still cares about his patients! I called at 5:30PM needing to see a Dr tonight and he agreed to see me even though I wasn't a patient and they closed at 6. He stayed open late and took the time to go over all my symptoms before writing me a prescription. His reception staff and nurse were very kind and helpful, they even offered to email me with my test results. I would definitely have Dr. Pinto as my regular doctor if I lived in Ontario.
5 TL;DR version:   Had my first visit last week. It was everything I dreamed it would be and more! I have a TEAM (health and wellness coaches AND a doctor) of people to provide me with excellent care. This is really how healthcare should be. I'm not limited to one issue per visit like I was with other doctors. They care about keeping me well and guiding me towards a healthier life. I've never had this level of care before; I feel so spoiled!  Full version:  My first visit was everything I was dreaming it would be. And more. I never would have guessed I would enjoy spending two hours at the doctor. (I spent three hours at the doctor once; 80% of that time was waiting, in the waiting room and in the exam room.) I was ridiculously relieved not to be confronted with a scale and a too-small blood pressure cuff first thing. Instead, I talked with my team for two hours, never feeling rushed or like I was bothering them by staying too long.  I mentioned "team." That's what I love about this place. With my membership (FREE with my Nevada Health Co-op insurance plan) at Turntable, I get a team of individuals to care for me. It's a wonderful and integrative approach that just makes so much sense to me. I get a health coach, who can help me make and work towards some health and fitness goals; a primary care doctor, who wants to treat me as a whole person, not just symptoms; and a wellness coach, who's experience in the mental health field. And they all work together so that all four of us are on the same page and doing what's best for me. What I hated about previous GPs I've had was that I felt like I was only allowed to mention one, maybe two, issues I was having at a time -- they'd never have time for more than that. And I felt like it was only necessary to go in when I was sick or needed a prescription for something. It was a chore, and I never felt like the doctors really cared about me that much. It feels nothing like that at Turntable!  I got to meet my team in a somewhat rotating fashion, which was great because I didn't feel overwhelmed or intimidated having to meet everyone at once. They all made me feel comfortable and welcome, and they kept saying how glad they were to have me there. How nice is that? To feel like you're not just a number? To not be shuffled through a procedural visit? Honestly, I felt so important, getting a whole team to care about me! I didn't feel rushed at all, and I feel like they all really, truly listened to and understood my goals and how *I* needed to achieve them. I'm excited about my health now, which is just what I was expecting and hoping of Turntable Health.  They've got some health, wellness, and exercise classes that I can attend free as part of my membership. However, the times aren't always convenient to my work schedule. Bummer. But they did say they're still trying to find the best times for classes, and they're working on slowly expanding the offerings.  It's so great to have a doctor who has the time to listen to more than one issue at a time, who considers me and my health as a whole (including my mental health!), who's personable and caring, and who's excited about motivating me. I almost feel a little guilty and greedy... I've never had this level of care, so that's going to take some getting used to.
5 I went to Chirofit after a car accident, and it was the best thing that I could have done. Dr. Stamp was awesome and really got my body back into shape... please forgive the pun. The office staff is very nice and is really on top of things. I'd definitely recommend the Peoria, AZ location!  The ONLY thing I was a little worried about (and not enough to take a star away) was that they are attached to a Gold's Gym. Never ONCE was I approached or pressured to join the gym.
5 I have seen a huge improvement in my mobility since coming to Backfit.   Friendly staff and works perfect with my busy schedule!
1 I went here about 2 weeks ago at midnight. It was a 3 hr wait and there were about 6 people in the lobby. I went here again 4 days later, had an appointment at 5:30am and it was still an hour and a half wait. I went here the last time a week later, had an appointment at midnight, still a 2 and a half hr wait. There is only one doctor and she will take her time and gossip to her coworkers while patients are waiting. The only reason I went to this place is because of my employer. I will never come here again.
5 Karen and Julie and the rest of the staff are wonderful, I purchased a MVT device from them last year and was very excited about using it, it did just as it says it would do and that is relieve pain.  It's an amazing little machine and I don't know what I would do without it.  I no long have any tennis elbow pain which is what i mainly use it for, but sometimes I get knee pain that is use it on and other aches and pains as I grow older.  I have recommended Dr. Milne and his device to several friends who are happy to have it too!
5 First time getting b12 shot . Super nice welcome from employees . It took no time to get the shot and was told about other things going on that I could look at over all just awsome
5 For those who know me...I only do food reviews but this business is an exception. When searching for an RMT its all about word-of-mouth...but most importantly the overall experience: ambiance, effectiveness, reputation, and ability to go above and beyond the clientele expectations.   I started my treatment just recently and I can safely say this place provides exceptional service. Irina M's ability to connect and consult were integral for me. In little to NO time she exhibited efficiency and effectiveness to penetrate the target areas where I currently suffer a sport injury.  Aside from that the place is great, very professional, soothing ambiance, soft easy listening music in the  background, Irina truly caters to the needs of her clients to offer optimal service!!!  Location is convenient since its right off the subway line and on the way back from work...location is key in my books!!!!  Two more treatments to go!..... umm Spacibo Irina ...I found out she spoke Russian lol
5 The office is now located on the southwest corner of 15th street and Osborn.   My ear had been hurting for days with what I suspected to be an ear infection. I was trying to avoid going to an urgent care and the hefty bill that often comes along with that. Every primary care physician I called in the area had a three to four week waiting list for new patients- except Dr. Corrigan.   When I called, the courteous receptionist let me know that walk-ins were welcome and there currently was no wait. From the time I called, I drove to the office and met with Dr. Corrigan all in about 45 mins! The wait was short, the office staff was more than helpful, and Dr. Corrigan was knowledgable and efficient!   I definitely recommend this walk-in clinic and plan to return and see Dr. Corrigan as my primary care physician.
1 Horrible experience.... pre-registered on ZocDoc just to find out they hadn't verified insurance, had to fill out all manual docs, etc. Get it together... it's 2016... Didn't even get in to see the doctor.
5 I first found Kayla Shelley on Zoc Doc for my husband.. Since then I have transfered my whole family to her care. The office staff is extremely organized and knowledgeable. We are always greeted warmly whether on the phone or in the office. Kayla is caring and compassionate. Listens carefully and works very hard to work to find solutions. She never talks down to me. They are never overbooked. Having the lab on site is extremely convenient. Great location.
1 Awful, unprofessional place. I was unable to get an appointment w my doctor and had to make an emergency stop to an urgent care due to my asthma. When one has asthma, you quickly cannot breathe which is quite scary. Upon entering, I told the receptionist I was having issues breathing and that I needed a breathing treatment. Within a minute or two a nurse came to check my vitals. She put the meter on my finger to read my oxygen, which same back at a pretty normal level. I was then told I had to continue to wait in the waiting room until it was my time, after about 5 people ahead of me.  The thing with asthma is that your oxygen levels could appear normal, however, your airways start beginning to close and breathing gets harder. Anxiety kicks in thus adding to the symptoms.   I insisted that I needed a treatment ASAP and was completely disregarded and basically left to suffer.  The medical staff need more training when it comes to treating people with asthma and learning that just because a reading says one thing, the person can still be in trouble.  I left shortly after after my symptoms were getting worse and no idea of whan I would be treated. I received amazing care and treatment at Urgent Care Extra (feel free to read my review).
4 I am simply writing this review because this medical office has never failed my family. We use the Skypoint and buffalo office in the Northwest/Centennial Hills area and have been very satisfied with our services. I personally have seen both Dr . Mark and Dr. Clark both seem knowledgeable and have helped in my own times of need.  I have been there for simp thing's and also things that sometimes seemed complicated.  Dr Mark has performed small surgical procedures in his office for me. I had a cyst removed from my chest being female it was akward for me and he was professional and did a great job in leaving very minimal scar visible. The convenience is amazing! I would also like to note that Dr Mark is a DO not a general physician so your in very good hands... Nothing bad to say. Not feeling good? Go on and give them a try you will be seen even on a walk in basis- They do close for lunch though-- happy health!!
2 Our daughter has been taking speech therapy sessions for over 2 years, originally she was taking them at Clubhouse Innovative therapy centers for the first year and a half. We later found T.E.A.M. 4 Kids online and after speaking to them on the phone, we decided  to switch her, mainly because of convenience , since we live in the west side of town and they offered a similar program as the one in Clubhouse.  Her therapist Chelsea was great and we could see our daughter making progress.   Unfortunately, ever since she left they have been under staffed and haven't been able to get regular appointments. What was really upsetting was that one of their managers reached out to us and told us our daughter had graduated their program and she had no more need to attend, when clearly that is remotely from the truth since she hasn't reached the goals set by her therapist. Ignoring completely the issue that they are understaffed and no longer available to accommodate our daughter, which I thought it was very unprofessional.  Their administration and front office is ran poorly. Which leads me to think them having a hard time maintaining good therapists.   I would strongly recommend looking into  Clubhouse Innovative Therapy Centers not only their therapists are excellent, their front office and administration staff are outstanding very involved friendly and caring for the kids, although it is 1+ hour drive for us since they are located close to Shea Blvd and Tatum is well worth the drive, hopefully they can open a center on this side of town.
3 This is a fine place to get a massage when you're on a budget. They have fountains, new agey music and decor. The massage therapists here seemed less appearance-oriented than other chain massage studios that I've been to. The room was really cold and I had to ask for the fan (that was aimed right at the table on a cold November afternoon) to be turned away or off. The therapist was skilled at finding knots and had a few signature moves that were pretty good.
5 This place was amazing! Very good customer care. They where extremely helpful. They asked questions, made me feel calm and just genuinely showed that they cared.   That being said, they can't do some things. Like prescribe controlled substance medication but for what I needed it was not a problem.  If you're in a bind and need to get to a clinic fast. This place is great. They don't take appointments. It is a walk-in only clinic. That being said, there was no wait when I got there.
1 My experience at this Dr Now (SAN TAN VALLEY) has always been bad. Other people I've talked to feel the same way about this location the doctors here don't take the time to treat you the correct way. I know doctors now of days have it hard because they are pressured to see so many people in a day but you can not get the correct treatment that way . I only go here if I'm in the area and have no other option do to the past experiences here.  ****WOW I FEEL THE SAME WAY...................................  and my additional comment they have new PA and Doctors all the time ....  It is turning into a medical MILL.  I ask for a referral to a certain Dr and they give me who they want..... Then I wait weeks to get referral changed.  I feel there is something going on their.......
1 My wife and I were referred to Sparks Family Medicine since our primary, Dr. Ng moved across town (FYI..Dr. Jeff Ng is AWESOME!). At first, they were very good and thorough for our physicals.  They did a great job with getting us dialed in.   I credit Dr. Fortson as he was my primary.  He left the practice at the end of 2015.  I was told that one of the other Doctors would become my primary physician, which I was willing to give a shot.  That leads me to January 2016.  My daughter is sick and I called them as they are a family practice with my wife and I as clients.   They informed me that they cannot take any new patients until July.  How can you not take the child of your existing patients? So I'm left trying to find care for certain members of my family?  I understand not taking in new patients but excluding members of a family at a family practice seems like very poor business.  When I asked, there was no explanation, just we can't take any new patients.  I informed them that they now have a couple openings as I would not retain them as a caregiver.  They really didn't seem to care that they were losing a couple patients.  The "we don't care about you" attitude was really strange especially for a caregiver.  Good news is that I found Dr. Fortson who I thought was awesome and he is still on my side of town.  It looks like I will be following him to his new practice.
2 This place is.....pretty awful, but it is one of the few 24 hour clinics that accepts my insurance. I will say that the nurses & doctors are very friendly & helpful though! They really listen to your problem & do their best to access it. That being said, the actual service here is ridiculous! Came as a walk in around 10:30pm and was given an estimated 45 minute wait. I didn't get seen until almost 1am! Later to find out that there was no PA or NP there- only ONE doctor on duty. Aside from that, the waiting room is freezing! Now, I've heard of doctors offices being cold, but this was ridiculous-thermostat was set at a low 69 degrees! Multiple people waiting to be seen asked for blankets. If you want a good doctor for (somewhat) immediate care, then yeah, I would suggest this place. But if youre not that sick & can wait until the next morning for an actual appointment at a regular clinic, that is highly recommended.
5 To give some context, I have been to many PT's and many body workers. I've even been a body worker. Scott is, so far, the best I've encountered. Do NOT go to Scott if you want to lay on a table and get rubbed for a while. It's not about relaxation. Your body is your temple and all that, but it's also a machine, and if the pulleys and levers are out of place/sync/whack, then no amount of epsom salt and meditation is going to cure what ails ya. Just like how you gotta work out to get stronger, you gotta work on your injuries to make them better.  I spend a very large portion of my life either rock climbing or hiking somewhere to film someone else rock climbing. The rest of my life is spent behind a computer, seated, in what is possibly the most unhealthy bodily configuration for someone with chronically tight forearms, upper arms, chest, and back. Add to that some chronic elbow tendonitis (or -osis, whatever), a hectic schedule living on the road, and you have a recipe for a bundle of chronic pain and limited mobility.  I keep most of this crap at bay with self-therapy, but that only goes so far. It feels like vacuuming the kitchen floor, when really, it needs a mop.  Scott is that mop.  In 90 minutes, he took my forearm extensors to the bone, gave 'em some active release....from typing, my pronators are as taut as a piano string. He isolated those bastards and gave 'em what for. The back, neck, and shoulder work was incredible, as I could open my chest afterward...which is rare for those of us with hypertrophied backs who rarely use our pushing muscles.  If I'm in town long enough, I'm going back.
1 Go somewhere else if you can. waiting an hour for a drug test and over 2 hours to see a doctor is a joke.
4 I've been a patient here for 3 years plus.  Dr. Davis is wonderful, very gentle and knowledgeable.  Jobelle my hygienist is wonderful.  She has helped make my gums and teeth healthy again.  I trust both of them very much, and recommend them to anyone looking for professionals with a caring touch.
2 Been there three times each time I see the dr 45 to 60 min After actual appt. time. They over book and double book.   Wish I could make my client wait that long and still be in business.
3 Rate a doctors office?  Same problem as rating a law firm: the providers are what you are rating.  My nurse and doctor pair were great.  They were timely, I did have to wait about 5 minutes past expected but once I was in there were no waits.  Did the vitals with the nurse and she was very friendly.  The doctor appeared as soon as the nurse went.  That was a five star experience, at other practices they have you wait 10 to 30 min in those exam rooms.  Like the hidden lines at Disney World.  I will come here again.
5 I'm amused reading these reviews about the $50 a year Administration Fee. People are acting like they're going to go bankrupt by paying that fee or are too lazy to talk to the Administration staff to fix an issue. A Doctor's office is not a one size fits all business. I gladly pay that fee since whenever I need anyone in my family to get in to see the Doctor I get in usually the day I call or the next morning. Try getting into any other Doctor's office when you're really sick and need medication. It's a no-brainer to grease the wheel for $50 once a year for quality care. Pro Tip - take advantage of your employer's HSA plan. Most employers seed your HSA with cash. Use that to pay your fee.  When I come in for an appointment I am seen on time. Once in awhile there might be a delay. In addition, the Doctor(s) actually take the time to explain test results and make sure you understand what you need to do for your health.
5 I'm very pleased with my experience at Paragon Chiropractic. I trust them to help me with my neck issues. This local spot is the place to go for your pain. They have been able to get rid of my headaches. I feel so much better after going to them since April 2015. I highly recommend this place!
1 I've been here twice and both times were very poor experiences. I am not coming back here, no matter how convenient the location is. Why you shouldn't come here:  1) The receptionists are very rude, impatient, and incompetent.  2) I tried calling numerous times and they never (ever) pick up their phone 3) I booked an appt online and still had to wait 45 minutes just to be seen by the doctor (who did not apologize for making me wait) and then he just passed me along to the nurse without needing to do anything.  4) The place inside is run-down and for the lack of a better word, "sketchy".   This place just makes me very, very frustrated. Again, never coming back again.
5 Elements on Shea gives the most amazing massages I have every received.  I get massages quite frequently.  I was tired of going to places where I got backrubs rather than true deep massages.  I've seen multiple therapists at Elements and I am constantly amazed at their knowledge and skill.  I've tried Jennifer, Dave, Emily, Jesse, Chad and would recommend them all.  They give a great deep massage and each have their own technique and specialties that help work out a different spot. These therapists have  great skill and experience compared to some of the other places I've been around town.  After a while, I became a member and now get regular massages for $59.  Just can't beat that for a consistently great massage and great relaxing overall experience!
1 This place just has terrible customer service. I was in a horse back riding accident and called to see if I could get in today as my pain has been getting much worse. I work part time and I am a student so it is difficult for me to get in on the weekdays. I called on Saturday to see if I could see a doctor and was told that "they don't do x-rays on the weekends so ill have to come back on Monday." Monday is a holiday and I am in pain. No help offered whatsoever by the person taking appointments. So thanks. For nothing. I also saw Kate Montgomery awhile ago and wanted some tests done on my blood. She acted like it was a burden that I was even in her office, and like I was stupid for thinking I had something wrong with MY OWN BODY. She just wasn't pleasant at all and I would never see her again. They also charge an annual fee for having you in their system that isnt covered by insurance. There are so many better practices out there I don't think Ill be going back to this one.
5 Two great experiences in the maternity center with Dr. Kramer and her team. Very nice staff, many have worked there for decades.
5 I have worked with Dr. Jenni and her team, as they have mentored DPT students I taught.  She is very passionate about her work.  I am comfortable referring to OSS if I have patients that need PT outside of my specialty.
2 I went to 3 different doctors here. Only one was good, Myerthall. The wait is always very long for any of them, then you have no quality time with the doctor. I waited forever to see the pain doctor twice and then he spent at most 2 minutes with me. I have since left completely. I will not go back.
1 I followed Dr. Mora here from John C Lincoln. I always liked Dr. Mora and wanted to continue seeing him.  At my first appointment, I discovered that no one in the office checked to see that they didn't accept my insurance. When I called afterward to find out how much I owed, I was first quoted approx $300. I remembered on the financial agreement I signed that there was a self-pay discount. The woman I spoke to agreed that it should be applied but didn't know how much it was or what I owed.   After a couple more calls I finally got the correct amount, paid and asked for a receipt and coding so that I could get reimbursed by my insurance. I was told something would be mailed to me, but I didn't receive anything after several days. I left messages on 3 occasions that were not returned.   I called a few more times and we struggled through basic things like visiting my company's website to get the fax number to fax the information (I was driving while she was looking up site, she told me there was no fax number, which is funny because it's been on our contact page for years). She then tried emailing me but for some reason that didn't work either, so I looked up the fax number for them and finally received the information I needed.   The thing that bothered me most was that every time I called, I felt like I was being rushed off the phone with fake courtesy. At no point in time did I feel like anyone there cared about actually connecting with me or being present to my needs. Beyond the fact that a medical office is staffed with people who don't understand basic technology, I was disturbed that the people who were supposed to care for my health... well, just didn't care.  I did leave a message for Dr. Mora, but he never called me, there seems to be a disconnect that wasn't there before.   On a sidenote, the office manager did a great job of getting in touch with me and addressing my concerns, going as far as agreeing my assessments of the issues in the office and saying that it would be addressed in training. Hope this is the case, but too little too late for me.
5 I've been going to Totum for almost a year now I think, and it's been great for seriously getting into weight lifting without having to navigate through clusters of bros and other gym jerks. Everyone is generally nice, respectful of space, and you know, no one is ever doing bicep curls in the squat rack.  I still haven't convinced myself to go on a repeat visit to any of the 6am classes, but they exist for those pre-work workout fiends. I'm just too much of a night owl. I'm also lazy.  Classes to chose from include yoga classes, Pilates, boxing, kettle bell workouts, spinning, crossfit, and a whole bunch of others. Lots of elliptical machines, 5-6 treadmills, and bikes. They also have a decent variety of weight machines, free weights, and other equipment to play with.  There is one personal trainer that without fail will change the music station from some amazing techno/dub/remix (you know, perfect workout music) to some weird classic rock/easy listening/crud, so word of advice - bring some headphones if you're going in the middle of the day. The weekend hours are not as convenient (they close at 6ish), but I do like that they're open later than most gyms on Fridays.  One other thing I like is that they have other sport related services available on site. In addition to personal trainers, there are chiropractors, RMTs, a holistic nutritionist, and an ND. It's nice to have the option of just going in, working out, seeing an RMT, or someone else, and going home.  It's clean, friendly, and welcoming. There is a free week trial, and I'd totally recommend you try it out. But only if you're awesome.  Worst/best thing - it's right next to Soma Chocolate.
5 This man is freakin amazing ! He adjusted my neck and back and his massages is just not all about deep pressure; what sets him apart from the rest was technique. I was involved in a major car accident years ago and had many adjustments by many therapists; he was by far the best one I ever had. You'd feel like the Hulk is working on your body so don't be afraid to tell him to chill out. You will be sore so that's normal. Don't mind his location of practice ; its in a great neighborhood and totally legit. The ambiance is mediocre, but your eyes are closed the entire time anyway. Are you paying for a massage or paying to look at candles?  He is my main guy I go to on a regular basis and now I can sleep at night.
5 I came here for foot reflexology and had a really great experience. The spa is very clean and my technician was really good. She worked on my feet for 30 minutes and my achy feet felt much better when I left. I definitely should have purchased a longer treatment.  I'll definitely return for another treatment in the near future.
5 Dr. Iacovelli is an awesome doctor!  Honestly, the best doc i've been to for thyroid issues.  (and i've been to a number in AZ, the Bay Area, etc)    I recommend everyone i know to her.  Well informed, courteous, honest, straight to the point.  No nonsense crap here.  And she's not afraid to look at non traditional tests / treatments.    I can't say enough positive things about her.  I will follow her to any practice.  Thanks, Dr. Iacovelli!
5 Celia is an excellent physiotherapist. I used her after a recent hip replacement. She was very well informed. She  was flexible, smart and a superior healer. She thoroughly assessed my issues and then provided the necessary therapy. She  communicated genuine caring with her healing touch which was both effective and very comforting. She was willing to go above and beyond in the name my healing. Easy to recommend her without hesitation.
5 I would highly recommend Total Lifestyle Chiropractic.  I recently severely strained my back and went in to see Dr. Chris Bonin based on a referal.  Dr. Chris spent the initial visit listening to me talk about where I was hurting, then taking x-rays and providing an initial evaluation.  On the next visit we reviewed the x-rays, which was very helpful as I better understood what was causing my pain, along with putting together a plan to help relieve my pain and better strengthen my back so it does not reoccur.  Within a month I felt much better and continue to stretch and go through the exercises to help my back.  The entire staff is very helpful and professional and I appreciate the level of care that they provided.
1 I've had numerous concerns with this office since I started visiting two years ago, and I'm finally leaving the office.  I agree that the front desk staff is often rude, curt, and makes me feel as though I am an inconvenience. The guest service of the entire staff is unacceptable. I've received attitude from the front staff, nurses, assistants, and even the doctors themselves.  Today the doctor left the room to get prescriptions for me, and the nurse brought them back. I asked the nurse if I could see the doctor again because I had more questions to discuss, and I was told that my apt. was over and that the doctor had moved on to other patients. I was never asked if there was anything more I needed before the doctor left the room. I let the nurse know that I will not be back to that office.
5 Very friendly, helpful and efficient staff. Had a same day sick appointment the first time I went there and have been going there for follow ups. Have been working with Kayla Shelley, PAC who is very helpful and supportive. Love the front desk staff too!
1 Got a 10 minute free massage at the chandler beer festival last week, they pitched me a Chiropractic package with an evaluation, X-rays, and massage included.. I bought it and then she set me up for an available appointment within the next week, sat at 9:30.  I show up to the Phoenix location at 9:30 to a sign that says "sorry for the inconvenience but we're closed on Thursdays and Saturdays until further notice".  I didn't receive a courtesy call stating this change before I drove all the way down on a Saturday morning, I called the number and requested I get my money back, I'm not doing business with them ever again.  This place is inconsiderate of their clients time.  I better get a refund in a timely manner. Avoid this place.
5 Let's start by saying Dr. Edward Tsai's office definitely earned all five stars! As soon as I walked in the receptionist was friendly and helpful. The staff was excellent and the doctor was fantastic. I will highly recommend this doctor to everyone, because Dr. Tsai listened to my situation then consulted me on the issue. I really believe I have found an amazing doctor in Las Vegas.  I'm truly impressed with Dr Tsai! I wasn't sure how to feel at first because I missed my old doctor.
1 After our car accident in California, (where somebody turned in front of us at the traffic lights), the attorney, who handled the case on a contingency basis, set me up with a chiropractor in Arizona, close to where I live. "Lundgren Chiropractic", probably one of the biggest mistakes I have ever made, I signed in, fully believing I was just signing a form to allow the chiropractor permission to preform manipulation on my body, fully believing that I was being taken as a patient on a contingency basis, another mistake, nothing was ever explained regarding my liability for the bill, if the insurance did not pay. It turned out that because there were no witnesses to the accident, that I had no claim against the other drivers insurance (incredible). This brings me to the ethical practice of this chiropractor, why were things not explained up front? He ended up suing me (and my companion) I was initially sued for about $6700, we settled for about $3176. I have no idea about the accuracy of the billing, I do know that I was billed for massages at $100, when it is clearly posted in his waiting area that it was $50 for 50 minutes, I have no complaints about the physical manipulation by Dr Lundgren, I felt no better or no worse after the drawn out treatments, I was under the belief that it was important to get treatments after an accident, I am not sure I believe that now. Regarding the pain Doctor (in the same office), I think that was a total waste of time, and I have concerns on procedures and billing, and why I needed to see him anyway. I put my total faith in Doctor Lundgren, that was a huge mistake. I advise anybody, be careful what you sign, read it completely.  When I talked to my attorney in California, she told me that it was unusual for a chiropractor to sue or go after their client if the insurance doesn't pay, I guess I just got unlucky. I will never use or recommend this place again, this has been an incredibly upsetting experience. I am 74 years old, it was very hard to give up part of my hard earned retirement savings.
5 I had posted a review already but, I failed to mention that all of the chiropractors and all of the physical therapy staff are all wonderful. I specifically listed Dr Zitnik(Chiropractic) and James in physical therapy because they handled my care the most but, Dr Pruni as well as Dr. Kalanj & Naomi(nurse practitioner) & Michelle for massages, all were awesome as well. It is so nice to have a medical team that make you feel comfortable and are consistent with what they do for you and how you are treated. I was referred to backfit by, my friend whom, had been sent to backfit by ,an attorney that was handling her car accident case. When I heard that ,that is how she found backfit honestly, I was skeptical. I considered that maybe they are a sketchy ambulance chasing lawyers place...They showed me that that was not at all the case! I now, like my friend that referred me, tell anyone I come across that, needs this type care to go to them. Thanks again Backfit team! You guys really are a huge help in fighting pain!     I am currently doing the HCG diet through backfit. Naomi and Cindy have been helping me be successful and making sure I'm doing the right things to get the most out of this diet.
1 Receptionist is rude, wanted to consult with the doctor before becoming a client and she was being his BITCH BAD WOLF and would not let me through to him because shes his office manager; which is another fancy word for receptionist. Unnecessary and costing a possibly decent doctor clients.
5 Excellent focus on individual care and treatment.  Very convenient appointment times and comfortable environment.  I highly recommend this place if you are in need of physical therapy.
1 What a God Damned scam-of-a-copay this office is:  You wait hours to be seen, and not only is it the wait time, you're seen by a new so-called doctor every time!   You (then) make your prescription requests (which are clearly articulated in your charts), only to be told weeks after your previous visit over the phone (because your wondering where the hell your refills are) you have to come back  for the refill -- the same refill which was requested on the previous visit!  Too boot, I get in a battle (with their office manager Angelic??) about their BS hustle, telling me that's the way their office runs, and that I have to come (back) in -- yet not one time did she ever try scheduling an appointment with me before hanging up. Hmmm.  Christ, what is it with Vegas?!  Shame on you, you hustling-ass #SunsetClinic!
1 They have lost the best of the best. The last FNP-ish was horrible. Seems to be quite the trend here.
1 Beware!!! This doctor is the WORST I have ever ever been to! I would never trust my life on him. He mis diagnosed my best friends aunt, and not soon after because of his old practices she later died of cancer. I did not take the advice and continued to see him. My father went in for a headache...Dr. Smiths exact words were "it might be a brain tumor, let's get you set up for a cat scan". He then left the room. At that point the nurse came in to schedule the appointment and my father was so upset(as one could imagine) he wanted to speak with Dr. Warren Smith again to clarify and ask more questions. The nurse informed him that he had already left for vacation. My father had known this fraud man personally! He left in tears. Dr. Smith has no character and no bed side manner. He sees patients for 3 min at most at a time, and then goes on to the next to make money. If you are looking for someone who misdiagnoses and/or has no bed side manner and treats people with no respect this is the pathetic man to go to. Money, money, money is all he is about. Keep that in mind the next time you think of scheduling an appointment. I hope this reaches so many suffering, nice people out there, who want answers not a greedy, money hungry doctor. I have never been so disappointed and disgusted. Please consider alternatives
5 Let me start by saying that I've had multiple adjustments from other chiropractors in my life, and Dr. Teames at Mountain Vista is completely different, in a good way.   He takes the time to fully understand what is truly going wrong, as opposed to just throwing you on the table and cracking your back repeatedly.  He runs neurologic tests using his iPad and other things to asses what is wrong & then adjusts you accordingly (manual or with this pain-free gun thingy).  It totally works.  I always walk out of there feeling 10x better and I wouldn't go anywhere else in the future for treatment.  The rest of the staff is really nice too.  I HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND Mountain Vista and Dr. Teames.
5 Such a wonderful place. Very welcoming and knowledgeable. All my needs were explained and they made me feel like I was in good hands. Looking forward to many more visits.
2 I experienced over 7 hours of waiting in the ER lobby. I was called in to see the triage nurse after about an hour, sent back to wait, had an EKG done and then sent back to the lobby to wait some more. I did receive medical attention, but not close to $500 worth of medical help. Didn't receive a bill from UMC, figured the insurance took care of the entire bill. Nope. No bill in the mail, instead, negative mark on my credit score and a collections agency calling to collect a debt. Bad service and a headache to follow. I've seen worse, but expected better from this place.
1 I agree with Ralph M. What is it with this Physical Therapist? I told him that 1) I only wanted one specific area targeted, and 2) I only wanted a specific therapist working on me. I asked him if he could meet those conditions. He agreed. However, not only did he not work on the specific area (as diagnosed by my doctor), at the next visit I was pawned off on some other young therapist who ignored the area of concern completely. I quit going. Despite paying up front, they are harassing me for additional money that keeps increasing every time they contact me. It's my opinion that, not only did they ignore the agreement on my 2 conditions, they are now intent on harassing me because I dared to question their lack of character for not honoring our agreements. It's apparent to me that I trusted a business that couldn't be trusted. It's also my opinion that they were going to say anything to get me as a customer, and are now spending time and effort to bleed me for more money simply out of spite for disagreeing with them. If, after reading this, you still decide to go to this PT, let your gut tell you about them based on the initial interview. Just like Ralph M, you will not get the warm and fuzzies from this PT. My wife just reminded me that, at the initial meeting, they gave me a ballpark charge per visit based on my insurance. Not only did they low-ball that estimate and charge me more, the initial visit estimate was half what they told me. So it appears they are either inept or dishonest. I think this review shows my vote.
1 There were two things that I disappointed at this place.  #1, When I made an appointment on the phone, the front desk girl told me that my insurance covers my visit.   Of course when I came for my appointment and  filled the forms and signed then she told me that my insurance won't cover my visit because my insurance company has no relationship with this place until June, what!!   Why didn't she tell me before I signed the forms? Because of her error it cost me $75 from my pocket.  #2,  I made an appointment with T and she gave me B, I was like really??  I was being polite, so I didn't make a seen.
5 Just had a "wife" forced doctor visit for a black spot on my shoulder. Dr David Hatfield was great. He is personable and took a minute to actually chat rather than the typically 5 min visit from other doctors I have been to.  The office staff were on the ball and made things easy too.
5 I came into Dr. Petrick's office limping and in severe pain.  As soon as my husband and I walked through the door we were treated with the up most  respect. I had been suffering through such pain from  my sciatica nerve in my right leg.  It was so bad I was unable to walk at times, missing a lot of work.  I had heard from my daughter n law that Dr. Petrick was the best. The first day he did his famously technique on me ART, at that time I thought  because how long I waited before seeking attention , I thought I would never walk again. He said " just have faith in me" I will have you back up walking and in no pain in less than 8 weeks. After that he put me on the decompression table and get this the doc himself  walked me to my vehicle and picked me up and put me into the SUV  and put the seat in the position he wanted me in so I wasn't putting pressure on my spine.  Now get this Dr Petrick himself called me that night to check  on me.. Can anyone out there say you have had the Dr himself or herself call you personally to check up on you? I continued coming in and having decomp, then you have Darren who works with DR Petrick do a soft tissue workout on me and teach me some exercises I can do at home. Then Dr Petrick did an adjustment on me and did the ART teq on me again. I got up from that table and walked around the room. No limping using both feet. I think Doc was more excited than me for he said YES!!! Now that's why I love my job so much.  I am telling you that If your in pain, this is the place to go. They make you feel like family, they always make sure your doing ok or if they can get you anything or do anything for you. I could have chosen a different Dr that my insurance covered but, it was worth every penny to pay out of pocket to have Dr Petrick work on me. For a year I suffered terribly and missed so much work. I can now return to work and will continue to go back weekly for adjustments and decomp....  Please believe me if your in pain and can't handle it anymore give Dr Petrick and his staff a try!!!!!! They are 5 star top notch all across the board. They explain everything they are doing and why, they all care about you as an individual not as a $ sign.  Your recovery is their reward!!!!!!!!   Give them a try!!! You will not regret it!!!!! I promise!!  Thanks Doc!!!!  Nancy & Steve
3 First impressions - Looked like a great facility.  We checked out a few in the area, and SNRC was appeared to be the best of the best.  The other facilities we looked at were flat out depressing.    Upon arrival to SNRC, we walked in and the staff and patients we encountered during our tour seemed happy to be staying and working there.  We left and felt good about transitioning our family member to SNRC for rehab.    Our family member was there for 20 days.  The therapy staff was fantastic ( OT MaryAnn especially ) .  Always friendly and willing to give and update on how our FM's rehab went that day.  The RNs were friendly and informative too.  The CNAs on the other hand, hit or miss depending on who was working the shift.     Because our family member was such a fall risk, we had to hire outside caregivers to come in from 5pm-7am.  Not sure if that's the standard practice when it comes to the elderly and/or fall risks.  But I do know that i didnt see any other patients have outside caregivers there during the evening.     I think overall the facility is pretty decent.  And I personally (not sure about the rest of my family) wouldnt be afraid to be admitted here for rehab.
5 I came to DIPT for a sports related injury and 4 weeks of prescribed rehab. I met with Cici who attentively listened to what happened to my thigh & thoroughly evaluated the problems I was having with bending my knee. Over the next 4 weeks I worked with Cici, Cayla, Arianna Dave, and Justin. They were the best to work with and I believe with their encouragement I was able to improve and 4 weeks later I'm completely back to normal. These people ROCK! I would definitely recommend DIPT!!
5 As a weekend warrior this is not my first visit to physical therapy. Foothills Sports Medicine was a pleasure to work with. Ted Carter knew right what to do to get my knee and shoulder back into shape in just a couple of weeks. Even though they have the earliest and latest hours i have ever seen I must have changed my appointments a million times and the office staff was always kind and understanding. If i get in a pickel again i will definitely be asking my doc to come back. Well done!
4 They won't give out wifi password, even though there's a listing for "Guest." Not nice.  But the office is brand-new and beautiful, so I'm hoping that this will change with time.  Luckily, I've never had to wait more than a few minutes before being taken, so it hasn't been a problem.  This practice is owned by two doctors in L.A., who are attempting to set up a complete medical facility, with all kinds of specialists to keep patients in-house.  I think they're looking for the cradle-to-grave experience, and I wonder who they'll get to do their mortuary work :D.  Parking is easy, and when you're finished, you don't even have to go back onto Warm Springs to get to the shopping center, where you can drop bucks at T.J. Maxx, Home Goods, and Glazier's Market - just drive right through.  At least for now, until something is built in- between.  The down note for me about this practice is that it's right across the street from St. Rose Hospital - St. Martin Campus, which doesn't have a great safety record, and that's who these doctors are affiliated with.  I'm not sure how that would play out if I needed a hospital, because I sure wouldn't choose that one.  Hope I never have to find out.  I do love the Dr. I see here, Dr. Harouni, and I will review her separately.
5 I was surprised to see the poor reviews for Five Star Medical Clinic. I love going to see this doctor. She takes time to talk to me and really listens. She is never in a hurry or annoyed if I need to ask questions or have concerns. She really cares as every doctor should. The girls at front desk are just as sweet and very efficient. I love office!
5 I've been coming here for 6+years and people are so friendly. There are couple of my favorite PAs I like there. Emese (i believe that's how it spelled) and Samantha Lee. First time with Samantha and she was very helpful. She was looking out for me and she was listening to my problem very well. I only had a problem with one of the PA there which I will never see again!!! I have told the office I refuse to see her. I can't remember her name but she scared me to death that I have some sort of disease  without checking me. Wtf!!! But going back to my normal PA fixed my issue. Other than that I've never had and issues. Samantha and Emesse is by far my favorite.
5 I have been treated with such kindness and respect by all staff members.  I have recommended Jackson Physical Therapy to everyone who's looking for an excellent center. My sessions ran out with my insurance do I am now coming using the 'gym' as a paying member.  Thank you so very much for this option.  I truly feel that we are a team.  In this atmosphere I can still ask questions of the P.T's and the Technicians and they all keep an eye out for me as well.  During the lunch hour when things are slower, I've had a PT give me new exercises to do.  I'm so confident I'm in good hands with Jackson.  Thank you to all for your care, concern, hugs and Love. But most importantly for all the excellent care. YvA
5 I've been going to Lifequest for several years now. I went in because I had carpal tunnel so bad it was debilitating. I could barely work. Even brushing my hair could shoot pain down my arms. I didn't even consider the neck and back pain that I had when I went in. Just thought that was normal. After an initial period of frequent visits to fix everything, I now just go there every other week for maintenance. It feels so good to take care of myself. The staff is great, and they also have a few massage therapists in office.
1 Twice in a row, after waiting 15 minutes past my scheduled time, do I have to proactively find out it will be another 45 minutes. Is this a cable company or a family doctor? Time to find someone new.
1 I would give them a zero if I could thus group is an absolute mess. No call backs horrible customer service . The worst Doctor experience I have ever had. Don't waste your time of money
1 sent me to collections for 600$ for not continuing with my membership. if you sign for a year you're pretty much stuck with it..only ever went 5 times
1 There are a lot of issues with this place.  They are understaffed with nurses;  they have a Nurse Practitioner that is not very good;  they are slow to respond. Had my mother in there twice this month and both times we had to send her to the hospital to recover from the treatment administered and neglected by the Sun View staff. There were issues with her care (or lack thereof) that were noted and recorded by the hospital in the ER.  They lied to the hospital about what I witnessed and then lied about what they claimed the hospital nurse had said. If your loved one needs any special attention , they will not get it here.   I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy. My advice is to look somewhere else I wish I could give it zero stars.
5 I went to see Eric yesterday for the first time. I've never had any treatments for my back before so I was a nervous Nelly. Eric was very professional and answered all my questions and educated me a lot. I look forward to going back next week and I will definitely recommend this place.
5 Scott is a great therapist. He tailors the massage to your individual needs. If you have pain, he can help!
1 I have a feeling all the good reviews are written by someone in their office or family members of people who work there so their loved ones dont get fired for their incompetence. Let me start by saying I've been to their office twice so far and have made 5 phone calls and NEVER AGAIN! 1. Wait times are ridiculous. They schedule a time AND tell you to show up 30 min earlier. Why do that if you are gonna be seen two hours after your appointment time anyway? 2. I saw Dr Waltman for 15 Min out of 2 hours that I spent in their office (mostly waiting) and I am not sure about others, but this doc definitely does not care about you, your health, or what you have to say. 3. They overcharged my insurance billing my visit as a "physical" but told me that they cant make it a physical since I need blood work and prescriptions. So I ended up paying the $46 visit fee, which I thought was strange since my insurance copay is $35. Their  billing department told me that that's the standard fee and of course, they charged me the extra $11 and my insurance  both. Then the 2nd visit, they tried to charge me $46 again, but that wasnt happening, not when I shouldnt have paid the 1st time since it was a physical.  4. 5 phone calls later and numerous voice mails later I lost it and through a fit on the phone that I needed my test results now, not in an hour, not in two, or 72 like Julie told me (never happened either btw)  5. I will repeat what everyone else is saying and reiterate that they've got some of the rudest staff ever.  Long Story short, do yourself a favor and dont make the same mistake I did. Good thing I have PPO cause I am never going back to that dump.
5 Ok...I must admit I have always been a bit skeptical of Chiropractors just having limited personal experience.  That said, I was so impressed with Dr. Alicia Myers this morning in a post accident visit. Her level of professionalism and expertise was so impressive and demeanor and humor made for a great experience. I'm so impressed!
1 At this point if Yelp would let me put no stars I would! So after calling for a week to simply have them refill my meds prior to me moving  they have still NOT! Even after daily calls they simply tell me the same thing "okay I'll let the doctor know when she's out of her appointment and we'll get them called in today". This place is horrible!!! Thank goodness I noticed I was up on refills prior to actually running out of my daily NEEDED meds others wise I would be SOL with this practice. An to add they just started do blood work in the office instead of sending you out. Which you would think is great right? Well not when the office doesn't bill to and you all of a sudden get a creditor call because the blood works office said they've been trying to get in touch will you and the doctor hasn't sent them you mailing address. I mean this is so unbelievable AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
5 Everything at DIPT was top notch. From scheduling to direct therapy to the guidance of exercises, all of the staff was helpful, friendly and encouraging. This being my first surgery and physical therapy experience, I didn't know what was involved, but the care was more than I could have expected. Dave was a great therapist and pushed me to get back to being active after ACL surgery. I hope I don't need the services of DIPT again, but if I do, there is no doubt this is where I will be!
4 This NHS surgery has changed a lot over the years, and it moved to this location almost 2 years ago. The practice consists of 5 reletively young GP's and runs numerous health clinics; diabetes, hypertension, well woman, cervical screening and asthma. They have a great repeat prescription service which allows you to fill out a form online and even specify the chemist that you want to collect your drugs from.    It does now also have a commercial side which provides health services for travellers. Free to NHS are vaccinations for Hepatitis A, Typhoid, Diptheria, Tetnus and Polio. All other services have fees payable for services from the Adventure Tourism Travel Health Clinic. Fees are payable for Hepatitus B, Meningitis and MMR vaccines.
3 I saw Haydee Docasar on 8/20/09, for a routine, yearly pap smear.  I did not want any other tests, because I knew my insurance at the time would not pay for them.  After my appointment,  I receive a bill from Quest diagnostics, for my pap smear, which was.....about $6. I paid it.  After that, I receive another bill from Quest, only this time, for $160;  for tests CPT CODES 87591- Gonorrhoeae and Trahomatis.  UNKNOWN TO ME, something from MY BODY, was sent out for testing.  I tried calling the office, and had several missed attempts. An employee named "Jimmy" and I were playing phone tag. After several calls, with no response, I figured that the issue was fixed. Seeing as how I did not ask for any tests.  1/30/10, I get a collections notice, for the $160.  On 2/12 I sent a letter contesting these charges.  During my visit, I was NEVER asked, nor where the tests addressed or spoke of.   I was not told by Docasar or the staff that samples would be sent to Quest for testing.   I was there for a pap smear ONLY, and nothing else.  I asked Docasar to pay the bill.  I DO, along with any other patient, HAVE THE RIGHT OF REFUSAL.  *On 2/18 I receive an answer.  Dr. Docasar follows the recommendations of the "American College of Obstertrics and Gynecology" for sexually active patients ages 19 to 35 is a yearly PAP that includes a screening for Gonorrhea and Chlamydia. This is their standards, which I did not see marked on their paperwork.  Dr. Docasar agreed to pay the charges, and I was "dismissed" from Docasar's care.  FINE WITH ME.  Haydee Docasar took it upon herself to conduct these tests without discussing them with me, and if she would have let me know that they were "mandatory" with a pap smear, I would have put my pants on and walked right out.
5 I have called 2x's and spoken with their customer service and both times it was excellent. They both went above and beyond to help me. My daughter was then seen today by Miss Strickland at the Ellsworth and Brown and she liked her. This was my daughters first appointment on her own and she felt very at ease. I would recommend My Dr Now.
5 I have been going to chiropractors my whole life so when my back was hurting really bad I went for a quick fix. The Drs Bock (husband and wife team) explained they want to help me feel better long-term. After living with 10+ years of pain with Fibromyalgia and Arthritis, I couldn't imagine feeling better but was tired of the pain so said let's do it. The office staff did a thorough exam and I saw the physicians assistant that works with the chiropractor.  I went back last week for the assessment, recommendations and first visit. During this visit I saw the Chiropractor, PA and massage therapist and felt better than I have in years! And I mean WOW! I can't imagine how I will fill after more visits and start living again. Very glad I visited this office and found this awesome team!
1 I was seen today by Dr. Kim for what I thought was a standard mole removal and after he burns it down to nothing, says it may be cancerous and we should excise it.  I wait an hour to find that he can't and had to go to the dermatologist close by to send to pathology just to learn that they can't pathology burnt skin.  His bed side manner sucked and he even went on a smoke break while I cried thinking cancer!  I would never recommend this place! Now I have to wait for this to heal to know whether or not it's cancerous!
5 There's nothing like being sick when you're 2,500 miles away from home. I was in Las Vegas for a conference and came down with a fever shortly after my arrival. Dr. George's concierge service did the trick. After a quick visit to my hotel room and medication delivered via courier, I was on antibiotics and feeling better within 12 hours, making my flight back to the east coast, as scheduled, without congestion. Paperwork for my insurance was delivered via email shortly after my return. It was seamless, speedy, and literally just what the doctor ordered.
1 Very long wait time, office unkept  I was a new patient with a 12pm appointment time for a routine physical. I wasn't seen by the nurse for vitals until 1:20pm, and I wasn't seen by the PA until 1:50pm. The physical consisted of the PA just asking me if I had any concerns, and then the referral out for blood work. With very few questions about medical history, and no questions about family history, I didn't feel like I was in good hands. Other patients in the waiting room all seemed to be waiting for a long time as well. Why accept new patients if you have a very long wait time?  The waiting area was unkept. I stepped on gum left on the floor, and when I told the receptionist she picked up the wrapper, left the sticky gum on the floor. Gross.
5 I just had my first appointment with Dr. Johnston and I really like him. He was friendly and took time to explain matters. I also like how they can take blood right in his office. A huge time saver.  Overall the staff was great!
5 Dr Boothe helped me with my hip and leg pain like no one else who I went to for relief.  The relief has lasted for weeks.   He has helped me to believe there is hope that my pain can be managed.  I am sold on his technique.  DonnaK
5 PA Kotlarsky and Medical Assistant Keisha were both incredible. I was seen in a super quick, timely manner and they were both warm, inviting, and answered all my questions.
5 The staff here are very professional and effective. I worked Lisa and Stephen and they are wonderful people who know what they are doing. I always feel better when I leave. If you are "broken" in some way I highly recommend Physicians Physical Therapy.
5 Always treat me great and fit me into their schedule whenever I call. Dr. Picarello is awesome and recommend him to anyone. This office also provides great massages and takes care of all my insurance needs. Can't say enough how well I'm taken care of.
4 I am very happy with this office. The office is friendly and timely. The physicians and M.A.s get back to you quickly, have email correspondence; the follow-up and get scripts and referrals out quickly.  I have been going to Dr Nelson for about 6 years now and am very happy with her services. She listens and is great with care.  The only reason I am not giving them 5 stars is that sometimes their "same day next day" appointment policy is a pain. They fill up fast and often I have had to call a few days in a row to get an appointment. Also, I have been trying to get my dad established as a patient at the office for over 2 weeks. They only take a few new patients a day and it fills up very quickly, by 9am or earlier. So this aspect is very frustrating, however once you can get established they are wonderful and will sick appointments right away.
5 Dr. Tice is an AMAZING doctor who genuinely cares about his patients needs. He works with you as a partner to understand your body and how it works as we get older. I recently went through what I thought was h:;(()LL with my health-ER, Family medicine, Cardiologist, OB/Gyn.... Dr Tice identified almost immediately that all of my previous stress and life obligations led to an anxiety attack! We are now proactively working on a plan to get my body-estrogen, testosterone, thyroid, weight balanced out. I cannot thank Dr Tice more than enough to help me gain my sanity back. His 20+ year expertise along with his big heart is an extreme rarity in Las Vegas. Every woman should be so lucky to partner up with Dr Tice. Like all of the other posts, his staff is 2nd to none. They are all so friendly and efficient. I look forward to seeing my health progress over the next few months! Thank you Dr Tice!!
3 This is a second review. Updating from a one star review for an utterly terrible experience trying to book an appointment to three stars because (although I'm still not interested in trying this place.) The owner reached out in a sincere effort to right the wrongs of the receptionist I spoke with. Which I sincerely appreciate.
5 Mariane was informative and really asked the right questions that allowed her to get a clear picture of how I spend my day at work, and then went on to demonstrate stretches that would benefit me most, after my amazing massage was done! First massage that really felt like it was loosening a lot of tension during the treatment itself. Amazing and thank you!
4 I had a good experience here with Dr. Kauffman.  He's knowledgeable and has great bedside manner.  This office is very busy. The only ding I give them is that they were not able to squeeze me in when I had an ear infection and I seriously didn't want to be charged $500 by the emergency room.
2 Nice staff, but it's not enough to make up for their confusing and unfair billing.  ------Beware a sneaky extra test-----  How much do you like getting unexpected extra bills on top of insurance-covered annual checkups?  My wife and I went in for an annual checkup. We were seen by Dr Mary Andrews. Without telling us, she ordered an extra test to be added to our routine bloodwork: Vitamin D Hydroxy. From a discussion with the billing department, it's clear that this is something they routinely have to explain to patients AFTER the fact (because it seems that they add this test *on top* of routine checkups frequently). In our case, they did not tell us.   The lab charges $82 for this extra check (per person), and then insurance gives a discount. It sounds as if insurance companies never completely cover this, because it's extraneous to the whole *annual checkup* thing that people come in for.   Asking about this, I was told by the front desk that the office will take care of it. They did not.  I got a much higher bill from the lab because of some sort of coding error and what then ensued was a series of calls between the insurance company, the lab and the doctor's office. What is clear is that the test was ordered by the doctor's office, and they have a "doctor knows best, and doesn't need to tell you what they're going to do" kind of attitude.  In the end, they asked us to suck it up and pay for it.  -----Thanks for the checkup. Now ya'll come back in for another checkup----  They're a business. They have to make money, but this is frustrating when it's just so painstakingly clear. We were both told to come in for more appointments in a few months to do bloodwork again (to check levels of cholesterol and blood sugar). Sigh. Why the tests can't wait until next year was never made clear.  If they were willing to nickel and dime at the annual checkup level, we decided we did not want to see what would happen if we were to come in for an ordinary appointment.   -----Overall experience------  Dr Mary and the office are all sunshine and smiles -- which apparently does little to make up for your presumed Vitamin D deficiency.   We really would have agreed to the extra tests to the annual checkup if they had asked about them beforehand. Ultimately, both my wife and I would trade in their pleasantries for a more upfront and honest doctor experience. It feels more like a business than it does a clinic.
5 Staff is friendly and attentive. Appointments start and end on time. I'm already feeling better after a few visits.  Amanda and Oscar have been great. Front desk is always friendly and helpful. Scheduling is very easy. Highly recommended for physical therapy.
5 Dr Fabito saved my life and I am truly grateful! I have been in pain management treatment for well over 10 years for treatment of a spine fusion. My other doctors just masked the pain with more narcotics but Dr Fabito sent me to have a lot of test done, acupuncture and even a chiropractor over the 6 years I was his patient. He made ever attempt to try to see were my base level was by trying to wing me off the medication but I was not ready! I then added alcohol to the mix which landed me into a detox facility for a short time! I was always very honest with him and scared to death but he made me feel the pain and took my medications back..he did not refuse to treat me he just needed me to come to grips with my pain..after more alcohol and no pain medication it landed me into a 30 day treatment facility at Las Vegas Recovery Center were my life had to change! I am now 4 months clean from any type of narcotics and for the first time in my life I am no longer numb..I  can finally feel again...discomfort a lot but nothing like the panic of running out of my medication! Dr Fabito cared for me as a person and not as a dollar in his pocket he has got to be the best doctor I have ever meet! If your dealing with chronic pain he will help you! If your looking for a dope pusher he will never do what you want he will do what is best! I love you Dr Fabito always! Thank you!
5 I have psoriatic arthritis, and am in pain throughout my whole body. Due to the joint damage, my shoulder has 3/4 tendons inflamed, as well as the bursa. Little to no mobility. After leaving the clinic, I could actually feel the pain slowly leaving my shoulder. After the second visit, my mobility has increased substantially. Now, after only 3 weeks, I almost have full mobility and my pain has decreased by at least 50%.   Reception is always welcoming, and will help you when needed. May go to voicemail when you call, but they call you right back.
1 I have been to this UC twice for my son.. the first time was not that great. The 2nd time I took him was because my primary care couldn't get him in that day... He was misdiagnosed and given meds that I said don't usually work on him... There were no tests actually done on him, they said he had an upper respiratory infection. I told them he had been throwing up and what can we do to stop it.. they ignored that. A day later I had to take my son to Emergency room, he actually had a strain of the Flu and needed to have different medication and be hydrated from the vomiting.   I never write reviews but I do read them, but I will never go there again. Being a single mom I thought it important to share with others my experience as it has to do with health and my child.
1 . Wish l could rate o.don't go here,had spine surgery 3 years ago nothing but worse chronic pain after can barely get out of bed a lot.went back they said can't do anything else its just going to get worse .went to there pain center just as bad .wish l could sue them.any lawyers out there,yes right. Butchers don't go there.
5 I went to Athletes Performance as an outside consult. They greeted me with open arms and treated me very well. The reason for my visit was to see one of their sport nutritionists. I met with Michelle on two different occasions and exchanged many e-mails with her. She took the time to evaluate my current eating habits, reviewed all my supplements and vitamins, and set up a meal plan based on my specific body type and goals. In the long run based on her recommendations I will actually end up saving money. For anyone who is curious how they can tweak or build a meal plan based on their own personal goals I highly recommend scheduling an appointment. At the time of my visit it was only $250 for the two appointments. She also offered to assist me through e-mail with any questions I have in the future. In the end I was completely satisfied with my visit to Athletes Performance, my only wish is that I could afford to actually work out there. The facilities and staff they have are simply amazing. If you have the resources you wont be disappointed. Thanks again Michelle for all your hard work, I really appreciated it and I'm on my way to meeting my goals.
5 I was in Vegas for a conference and needed a massage. I wanted a good massage not necessarily a spa day. He came to my room which I was nervous about. No need to be, he was professional and very careful to make sure I was comfortable. He is very knowledgable and explained what muscles were causing pain in my leg. Warning, he is very strong and really works the muscles so be prepared for a little pain. This is not your foo foo day at the spa massage.
1 do not go here, the customer service is ok but the follow up is horrible, the worst I"ve seen had a mri done and waited almost 3 weeks for them to call me so I can go in for results, I had to call them to schedule a follow up, then I had a mri on my knees and once again after 3 weeks I had to call them to find out if my mri had been received and forwarded to ortho, I keep getting the run around and no answers, still waiting super upset, will never go here again or recommend anyone
1 I went to Dr Fry in search of a doctor in Arizona who knew something about Lyme disease. I move here from NH and I had been going to ine of the top lyme doctors in New York for 2 1/2 years but was still undergoing treatment and needed a local doctor. I tried to share my extensive history with him but he didn't want to hear it at all. He told me all doctors were wrong about Lyme disease and went into some rant about how his testing was the only one that was accurate.  When I had questions for him he got offended and treated me so horribly I left in tears. 2 weeks later I got a letter saying he would be refusing to treat me from that point forward. I certainly wasnt going to go back after the office experience so there really was no need for the letter. What doctors sends a letter like that? Oh and did I mention his office administrative practices are awful? I paid at the time of my appointment and 2 weeks later i got a bill with his lovely letter. Luckily I had my receipt handy and sent that along with a letter of my own in place of payment. Dr Horowitz, you should remove is name from your Lyme book Why Can't I Get Better.... A well respected doctor should not associate himself with the train wreck of a doctor that Fry is.
5 I have been going to golfstretch therapies for approximately 2 months, I was referred to Adam by a friend. I am an avid single digit golfer in my 40's.  After my initial evlauation Adams in depth knowledge of the golf swing and body mechanics helped identify where I needed to improve and he designed a program to do it. The results have been fantastic.  I highly recommend this business for any sport that involves balance, rotation and power (golf, tennis, baseball, etc.).
1 Sadly Warner Family Patrice only cares about $$$.  They schedule extra tests without explaining why the tests are needed.  I had blood work there and the tech who took my blood left me with a softball size bruise on my arm that lasted several weeks.  I had tests done outside the office, mailed them the results twice and both times they were lost after telling me they were received.   Early morning appointments, PA/Doctors are never on time which backs up the entire day.  PA Gail (who is no longer there) once snapped at me because I asked her a few more questions and she stated she was already running behind and she was NOT going to go without lunch again like she had the previous day.  The office called me last week regarding an appointment I had in October (I never scheduled this, they automatically did) I told them I would not be returning to their practice and the reasons why.  They just called me again today about my appointment in October.  I had to explain they called me last week and I told them then I would not be returning.  The patient portal is a joke.
1 Stop playing games and give me my money back!!!! I absolutely am terrified to return to this gym. A few months back my son was injured badly because the staff wasn't watching the children and when they couldn't find me fast enough they lied to the General Manager and claimed I must have left. I went to pick my son up, was greeted with yelling and disrespect, the General Manager acts as if he's dating one of the staff in the childcare so nothing happens to the staff, I get an insenre re apology but only after he assumed I knew someone who works for corporate. Since that date it's been even worse . They have turned me away once loosely enforcing their scheduling policy and one staffer actually argued with me while I was working out. They gym is dirty and run down! I want my money BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2 This review is for Noel Chamian. His demeanor is cold and a little off putting. But I got used to that face to face. I continued to see him 4 more times throughout the year.  Unfortunately for me, I had further questions about my recent visit and doubts about a lump appearing in my abdomen. He didn't examine it and down played its appearance as normal and harmless, based on a few more I have in my body, none of which have been tested, ultrasound. But this one in particular is causing me some discomfort. Pain. I have doubts and wanted that one tested, just in case. Wouldn't you?  When I contacted the office requesting tests ------everything got befuddled in the messages back and forth. I asked the staff if Chamian had listened to the message, the staff said he never listens to the messages and he doesn't return calls. Only support staff will relay messages. A doctor that won't call you. OK.  Do I need an ultrasound? Do I need a follow up appointment? Why is this one painful and the others not? I was confused what to do. The girl on the phone said Dr Chamian advised just keep my follow up appointment set for 3 months from now. Let the problem sit for 3 months. O-K...  I said to the staff maybe I need a second opinion then? Somehow they relayed this to the doctor and the staff called back hours later with a message from Chamian "I should seek another doctor" and he cancelled our future appointments.   I have never had a doctor so disinterested. If I had it do over I would have gone with Francesca not Noel. The staff is friendly and helpful as they can be and she has so many amazing reviews its really hard to believe I have to write this today.
5 Great group of medical professionals. Very compassionate care. They been helping me and my family with our medical needs. I love the same day appt option and they usually have openings or next day due to my busy schedule
1 I HATE being this guy, but Dr. Chung and his practice have forced my hand, so here we go....the guy is terrible, absolutely terrible.  Where to begin?  IF you're unfortunate enough to have to use this guy then you will wait and wait and wait to see him.  Appointment is at 9:30am you say?  Good luck with that.  You'll be lucky to see him by 11am.   Who does that to paying customers?!  Both my girlfriend and I experienced on multiple occasions this phenomenon.    Oh, it gets better...ready?  On several occasions when my girlfriend went there to obtain her ADD medication (yes, she really has bad ADD, and no she does not abuse it) the good Dr. recommended that she get a lady-parts exam, too!  WTF is that about?  Not cool.  On top of making inappropriate comments about her appearance and personal life, I was also displeased to find out how incredibly difficult his front desk staff was.    This guy is a waste.  State of Nevada medical board should look into this guy.  Avoid him at all costs.
1 This is horrible medical office. In order to talk over the phone, phone system does not work. You need to hold phone more than 40min. Also this office usually try to set up some stupid visit to take additional visit. It seems you need to meet your doctor every month. I am tired up with this office.
3 My 5 year old son comes here for speech & occupational therapy. The staff is really nice & the therapist are all awesome. Minus two stars for two things one of them being organization in the office. Like I said the staff is really nice but you have to be on them about appointments, changes etc. My son was approved for an additional 2 more days of therapy but nobody bothered to mention it until I kept asking different staff members. It kind of sucks because he could have been getting more help all this time. On a few occasions I wasn't notified of a cancellation so I've made some trips for nothing which is annoying especially when you're pregnant and could have kept napping. Instead of phone calls I asked to be put on text alerts & I've received phone calls instead of text. I feel like the office is all over the place.  The other downfall about this place is the building itself. It used to be a house so there's limited space in the waiting room and there's hardly ever parking. It's kind of irritating when you have to walk across the street in this heat especially if you have other kids. Oh & if you have to use the bathroom you have to use a porta potty which is such an inconvenience so I usually drive to the Vons across the way while my son is receiving therapy. Other than that my son loves coming here & he's come a long way from when he first started. If everybody wasn't so sweet & if I wasn't seeing improvement we would go somewhere more  convenient.
5 Staff is very friendly, and Dr. Gustin is great! She takes time with you and listens. We've found a great Dr!
1 I have been going here for three years as a self pay. I have never once seen the actual doctor, and wondering if he even exists. I am never greeted by the girls at the front. I always arrive early, but end up being taken back 45 min after my scheduled time. When I get called back and asked why I am there, they are short, rude, and very condescending.  I now have insurance and am currently looking for a new doctor. I have never felt so undervalued.
1 Do not go to this place! The staff is rude and the providers are not knowledgeable.  They have tried to expand business as a primary care office but is merely an urgent care. Stay clear!
1 I have been here several times. One time, they got me mixed up with another patient (don't know how because my name is so unique) so they treated me according to the other patient's condition and did not discharge me for an extra 3 hours because they had to get everything straightened out. I was told that my description of symptoms was "wrong and not possible" by a woman who never introduced herself, so I am not sure if she was a doctor or if she even worked there. AVOID AT ALL COSTS! They also gave me a handout for high blood pressure because according to them, 110/70 is too high. Completely incompetent people working here and I will not return even if I am dying because I will never put my life in their hands again.
2 I enjoyed coming here for physical therapy the first few weeks, My PT(s) were great!.. But as time came the pt would hand me over to the techs to do exercises with me, The three techs I had were on there phones during session time, I had to correct them on telling me what to do,  and were goofing off as if it was a middle school, socializing. I also overheard one of the "head" techs talk behind a pts back she made me feel uncomfortable left to a different foothills location for that reason.
5 I have been seeing doctor Fereidouni for the last four years and am always pleased with the high quality of care. He is dedicated to getting to the root of any issue and takes the time to make sure everything is addressed. He's knowledgable and the staff is friendly and so helpful!
1 Arghhh screw this place. Chiara F was definitely right about the fact that people should NOT come here!!! I too waited more than two hours for a simple prescription. I asked them if they took healthnet and they called to make sure. They said that they took my healthcare provider and now I ended up with a bill for more than what the cost of the visit was. Ugh, livid with this place. Do NOT come here!
5 I've been in 4 car wrecks all resulting in lower back pain. Eric was patient thru my long recovery helping me get to a point where I am stronger than I've been in years.. And pain free! I trust his opinion so much that I skip going to my primary Dr and go straight to Eric. Not only is the staff knowledgeable, they treat you like family. I highly recommend Eric and team.
1 Receptionists are always rude. Doc Janelle is extremely condescending. Do not go here. They do not care about your well being all they care about is getting paid from your insurance company.   One time I was in the waiting room and the receptionist called out to someone telling them they had an STD. I felt extremely uncomfortable and if I were on the other end of the phone, I would hate to know that there was a room full of people listening to that type of conversation.
5 Just moved to NC and needed to see a physician about my serious digestive issues.  So very highly recommended! Caring staff and doctors. They really go out of their way for everyone and listen to what you have to say.
5 Amazing place!! I have been coming here now for almost two years. I get the decompression table done each time and helps in every way. All the folks are friendly and give the office a very relaxed family vibe which is amazing. At times there are waits in the morning when they first open but nothing too long and well worth the wait.
4 Thorough physical rehab facility. They know their stuff!
2 I fractured my foot in January and was referred to Endurance Rehab by my physician.  I am not by any means a professional athlete.  I am active and work out daily and hope to continue this lifestyle.  I have had two prior surgeries on this same foot on the achilles.  I have considerable flexibility issues and  daily pain. I first went to Endurance Mesa because I work in Mesa but live in Scottsdale.  I would set up my appointments weeks in advance.  My appointment was scheduled at 9 and the 10 am patient showed up an hour early.  Brandon, my therapist in Mesa, chose to work with her.  He told me I could wait to be seen.  I take time away from my job 2-3 hours a week for this therapy and set up a time that fits my schedule.  At this time I chose to transfer to the Scottsdale location.  My first two times were great with Shane.  Shane is very knowledgable and I felt it was a great decision to switch locations until my third visit there.  Again, my appointment was booked weeks in advance with Shane.  You sign your name next to your preprinted appointment  time and therapist on the sheet at the front desk.  At the same time, Shane took back another woman and began working on her.   A physical therapy student came and got me to work on my foot.  The student was going to do a procedure on my foot that only a certified therapist had performed and I told her I did not feel comfortable with her doing the procedure. I did a few more of my stretching exercises and only saw Shane a few minutes prior to the end of my appointment.   I contacted my insurance to see what what being covered and billed and I am suppose to see a therapist not a student and technically for an hour.  I have switched to another wonderful PT that sees me for 25 minutes of my hour at every appointment.  Each time I went to Endurance I had a different student and there was no consistency in direction on how to perform certain exercises.  All employees are friendly at Endurance.  I hate writing bad reviews but I did call and have discussions about my concerns but nothing changed.  I want to have someone that I feel takes my recuperation as serious as I do. There are many therapists at Endurance and I observed several working closely with their patients.   I would recommend having a discussion about expectations of service and commitment prior to therapy to make sure this place is a good fit.  I did interview my new PT prior to therapy as well as asked for recommendations.
1 My review is tainted by the PA Honey Marquez.  My wife went in this evening to have a small rash looked at, only to be harrassed because she has PCIP insurance.  This is the Pre-existing Condition Insuarnce Plan, aka "Obama Care."  Once she understood what the insurance was, this PA grilled my wife about how much it cost for us, and how did we get it.  She then excalimed that we can only have this affordable insurance because somebody else is paying for it.    I am myself, an eye doctor.  It is completely unprofessional for a so called, "health care provider" to question anyone about how they got their insurance, or how much it costs them.  Seniors don't pay very much at all for Medicare, and I don't see many providers complaining to the elderly about that!  My family will no longer be utilizing any of the Urgent Care Extra facilities, unless this person is fired for what they put my wife through!
1 Has got to be one of the worst hospitals in Las Vegas.  My husband who is currently there, has been treated with very few caring nurses and only one doctor.  The other staff members (including most of the doctors) just don't seem to care about the patient or family members.  My husband even had one nurse slap him numerous times in the face to wake him up just to drink his coffee!! (She was replaced).   He has been given so much pain medicine (morphin, Oxy cotin and Oxy Condon) that he can't even answer their questions when asked, then they get annoyed when they don't get a responsive answer (duh).  A doctor came in his room on May 15th, who had never seen my husband before and didn't know anything about my husband's biopsy or his condition.  When my husband tried to ask him questions, the doctor wasn't even listening to him.  He just kept flipping thru pages and then left!!  How dare this hospital treat people like this!  Beware if you have to go to UMC.  You may leave sicker than when you arrived!!!!!!!!!
5 I've never written a review but as far as time waiting it's pretty good maybe 15 min in waiting room then up to 30 or depending on your condition once you are in with nurse and PA combined. If you go to surgery center, I've been called in early because they were ahead of schedule. I've never waited in surgery for shots more than 20 maybe once. Most of time I'm back there with IV in 20 min from time I walk in the door. I've done epidural so for a year in 2011 then radio nuerotonomy this yr. Dr Burkhead is a great Dr and good bed side manner. All nurses are good starting IV the first time every time. Pam and Val are great at Summerlin location. Overall I am pleased with their service.-Bryan USAF
5 Just started with Paper Cranes Healthcare - very happy with service so far!!! Will update accordingly though very professional and easy going experience. The location is very convenient as well for folks living in Chandler.
1 Beware...think it over before doing business with this crooked establishment! Not even worth 1 star! All they care about is how much money they can suck out of YOU and your insurance company. The only thing this place specializes in is hidden fees and bait & switch tactics! Only wish I had done more research before wasting my time. I'm right back where I  started, no relief! I highly suggest you look up these doctors on the Internet first...that will tell you all you need to know.
1 I don't normally leave reviews.  But this was a horrible experience.  My wife made an appointment to see Dr. Casalma, took time off of work, cause she had a cold. When she turned in her questionnaire, she listed that she previously had joint pain. She was refused service, even though she wasn't there for pain medicine, they still wouldn't see her. If they had conditions in place to refuse service, then those conditions should of been addressed prior to scheduling an appointment.  It was a waste of time, and my wife could of made an appointment somewhere else. To top it off receptionist Leslie was rude about the whole situation. Please don't waste your time to be disappointed here. Find another Drs. office that will genuinely care about your needs.
5 Doc Chris is awwwsome not only is he doing a great job on my middle back pain but my daughter has had chronic back pain for several years  and after only 4 visits she is doing so much better its just amazing will stay with him as long as I can
1 For the last two months they would not answer the phone. Also is taking 3+ months to get a referral done. Called out of order again today. I've been waiting 2 hours and they called someone who had been waiting less than an hour. Dr Adam's is great, but I'm done, their front and back office staff is horrible!
5 Biochem landed me in this mess. Glycolysis and gluconeogenesis with all of their enzymes popped 6 of my ribs ribs out of place. After craftily escaping the Russian torture traction contraption that Hubsky set up for me, I saw Dr. N.   He found me on the side of the road, writhing in pain, screaming for mercy, pleading for an escape from all of the mind-numbing metabolic pathways with their sideways arrows. Like a glorious knight in shining armour, he whisked me off to his cozy office in Ahwatukee and beat my twisted back into submission. After sending me off with a prescription for a body pillow and one followup appointment, I skipped back home into the setting sun.   I have had mixed experiences with chiropractors before. One did the job but left no lasting relief. The next one loved me so much he wanted me to visit three times per week... And then there was Dr. Nemanic.   This review was a long time coming. I visited Dr. Nemanic again last week for an adjustment. He is a patient and knowledgeable guy who is always up for good conversation. He is not one of those doctors who will advise spending thousands of dollars in his office. He assesses the situation and then corrects the problem as efficiently as possible. I can't say enough good things about this doc. Just go. Are you in pain? Go now!
5 W-O-W, I am somewhat surprised and very confused about these two reviews below! I'm sad that Jim J. came across such an awful employee. I understand these two men completely, but so far my experience has been totally different.  Here is my experience, I walked in for the first time and I was greeted I suppose nicely since I don't remember anything out of the ordinary... I asked the reception if I could have a tour  or look around and the head Trainer happened to be near me. He grabbed me and eagerly said sure. So after we chatted and looked at the training areas, he explained to me that I had to make an appointment with the Sales guy and I did conveniently for the following day.  The appointment with the sales guy was shorter then usual b/c I had already seen most of the facility the day before. I enjoyed talking with him, at first it was like a lifestyle interview and I told him why I was there. I was very impressed with the whole place. The women's dressing room is not smelly. There are fresheners everywhere. The showers, when I am there, are very clean. There's not even hair caught in the drain, which is something I can barely tolerate.   98% of the time I get the exact cardio machine I want. There are TV's with cable connected to most of the machines, requiring you to just plug in your earphones and you can watch TV while you workout. My one irk :: these TV's do not always work and this is annoying.   I am there 4 times a week for about 1.5 hours each visit. It IS very expensive, I pay a permanent $86 and some cents / month for my membership - my rate will never go up. HOWEVER, your towels - they provide them and there are always plenty.   There is not one, but two hot sauna rooms available in the shower area.  Of cosmetic items they provide (and is included in the membership per month): - Q-tips, Cotton Balls; - Body & Hand cream; - Hair gel & spray; - At least 8 hair-dryers (there is usually always one available for me to use when I need it after a shower); - Shaving cream (& disposable razors, by request); - Shampoo & Conditioner (in the shower stalls);  So in the end I thought it was worth it although I haven't needed to cancel anything yet. ;-)
5 This place is amazing! Everyone that works here is very knowledgable about the importance of colon hydrotherapy and the benefits of it for your overall health. They really care about you. I love that everyone is super friendly. I highly recommend this place if your looking for a place to get a colonic. The atmosphere is very peaceful and relaxing. I would give 10 stars if I could.
1 Kerri cuminskey followed up today and said they could not do anything as far as compensating us.  Even though the last time that I spoke with her she said she would check with her billing department to check and see if they could not bill Medicare for my dad's stay.  Beginning to see a pattern with how sante deals with complaints.  They escalate the problem and take about two days and then they call you back and tell you there is nothing they can do.  Again I will appeal with Medicare as everyone that I have dealt with at sante admits that the care was not acceptable and that they appreciate my input and will implement my suggestions.  Please do not use this facility if you care about your loved ones health.
5 Alper is the best massage therapist I've ever had, and I've been seeing RMTs for 20yrs.  I've got severe back pain and issues stemming from deep inflammation, 3 spinal fractures, degenerated discs, and accompanying muscle spasms. I've tried other RMTs, physio, osteo, TENS machine, muscle relaxants, and no one/nothing is able to shut off the muscle spasms, except for Alper. Seriously. Superficial and deep muscle spasms are solved by him. He also does other massage work on me, and is amazing.  I wholeheartedly recommend him if these are your needs: - an excellent and affordable RMT. - suffer from muscle spasms. - suffer from back and neck pain. - an easily accessible RMT (right across Dundas West Station, which has escalators and an elevator). - is totally not creepy, is professional, down-to-earth, caring and does a great job. - is as gentle as you want, or goes as deep and hard as you need.
5 I'm very picky when it comes to new doctors. Dr. Rosenstein on the other hand, has been one of the nicest doctors I have been to. He doesn't make me feel like he is rushing me out of the office and he is very sweet! I would recommend him to anyone!
5 I've been seeing Dr. Norton for years and all tho he does get busy with patients if you speak up he will answer your questions and concerns. But it's not a therapy session seems like to many people want a one on one in depth without taking into concern their are other patients and concern expecting mothers. All I can say is I have had easy access to lab work results and scheduling and even easier access to speaking to a nurse about my concerns. Great staff would definitely recommend!
5 She is amazing. I have search high and low,  far and wide for a Dr. That wasn't going to fill me up with prescriptions and actually take the time to figure out how to heal my body. Finally I have found her. I am so grateful for Dr. Dykema she truly cares for her patient's and in my eyes is one of the few Dr.s that actually do their job by helping their patients get better rather than throw a bandaid on it.
5 I've been very pleased with this facility every time I have gone. The service and the front desk is always a pleasant experience and Dr. Moody makes sure to get you in and out with everything you need!   I needed a doctor QUICK the other day and he saw me within the hour. Always seems to be a good atmosphere in the building.  I'd suggest Dr. Moody for anyone, especially someone with a busy schedule like me. He was even willing to see me on a Saturday when I was in real need.
5 This place is absolutely amazing!!!! They're so informative and the atmosphere is great. I had never done a wrap before but this place was a perfect choice. They're reasonably priced and have great package deals!!!!
5 I have gone to Lois and Staff at AZ Sportcenter for 2 different injuries and avoided surgery due to their excellent care and service.  I would highly recommend.  It was easy to schedule and work into my very busy schedule. Will always choose them for PT!!
5 Today was my first time doing wny type of physical therapy and i was a bit afraid but the staff @ jackson physical therapy were so kind and so explanatory the drs explained everything we were going to do today and for my next visits. They helped calm my nerves and didnt do anything special but there top A++ costumer service. Thank you all sooooo much. If you or any one you know is in search of a physical therapy dr and location i totally forgot 100% recommend Jackson
5 I love it here! I've been going for about 2 months and have definitely seen results. Most importantly, I'm so much more consistent with my workouts. The trainers are amazing and they take the time to make sure you are doing everything correctly so you don't injure yourself. Every workout is different which makes it fun! The classes aren't overcrowded so you don't feel like you are getting lost in the shuffle. Worth every single penny!
5 I am a Nurse and I am also a single mom. Anyone who knows what being a single parent is like, knows that it usually means you have to have a tougher and more disciplined attitude. Getting to be the softer and sweeter version of yourself as a single parent is non-existent.  My youngest son broke his clavicle during football and of course the rationale of being a nurse... gone when it's your own kid.  Following up with Dr Harmsen a few days later was a huge relief. Dr Harmsen was direct, informative and took it upon himself to tell my son that breaking a clavicle hurts but he would survive. I got to be mom and didn't have to be a nurse- Dr Harmsen got the tough job and encouraged my son to use his arm and practice exercises. Even adding he also broke his clavicle three times- so once was nothing. I really appreciated the follow up x-rays, the new figure 8 splint, the exercises, the tough talk and will see you again in 4 weeks for our final appointment.
5 I just had an EPIC massage treatment from Rachel; she helped identify and calm the spasms that were happening with my psoas muscle. She does great work and makes it look easy. The room is so wonderful and cozy, and everyone's energy is uplifting. I can't get enough of this place and YOU SHOULD TOO!
1 Awful on so many levels. Went in for the first time for an ear infection. After writing me a prescription, the PA required that I get an EKG and blood work done because I am a new patient. The sole reason for an EKG and blood work to check my kidneys and liver was because I am a new patient. There is absolutely no reason why a 20-something would need an EKG without any heart complaints. A simple ear infection turned into an hour and forty-five minute appointment.   When I went to check out, there were patient files sitting on the counter. This included a patient's name and prescription sitting out, which I could visibly see and read, clearly violating HIPAA laws.   This office is unethical by requiring unnecessary testing of their patients solely to collect insurance money. Not sure how they are still in business.
3 Went here on a work injury at 7am on a Saturday after a holiday.  Everyone warned me of 4+ hour wait. When I arrived there were maybe only 6 people waiting. From the time I sat to the the time I got out 3 1/2 hours.  There are tvs is the waiting room.  A nice little coffee machine with a good coffee and tea selection.  There's a room just for eye exams.  I also got some head X-rays.  The good advantage is to get everything I needed in one place. No need for referrals and additional wait times.  I'm satisfied with the doctors examination. However the wait is long here and I hope I never need to come back.
1 I called to make a first time appointment for my three boys who need physicals for the new school year. After being put on hold for roughly five minutes I was informed that they cannot accommodate three first time appointments in one day. I said I work and that means I'd have to take off two days of work to have my kids seen. The appointment setter said yes that is correct. I suppose if you have one or two children then this could be a good practice for you.  Unfortunately this practices shortcomings have forced me to seek medical care elsewhere.
5 I see Dr Christopher and she is amazing. The staff is always nice and welcoming and of course after my frequent visits they have gotten to know me well.  They have a huge area for therapy, treatment etc and exam rooms as well which I like.   Pretty soon to be getting my husband in for a visit and adjustment. I have had no issues and have been here many a times. And will recommend the greatness and magic here!
1 My Left Foot Children's Therapy was recommended to me by my pediatrician to address my child's speech needs.  We reached out to them when she was two years old and she just turned three.  We were now contacted by them to schedule an appointment for my child.  I asked why there was a year delay, and they said that there was a failure in their system and the information was now retrieved.  A year later?!?!?  Believe me, I did not let my child's speech needs go ignored.  I followed-up several times when I did not hear anything, but was told that they were booked and I will be contacted when they had openings.  Apparently, that is a year later.
1 The front desk lady is very rude (jasmine) and I have been waiting over 3hrs to be seen just for some lab results. After I get my results I will not becoming back nor would I recommend this place to anyone. Just terrible. The only reason I gave it one star is because I had to otherwise it's not even worth that.
1 Talking to Jesse over the phone when he asked for my phone number I said no I just have questions he hung up on me! So rude these people are so unprofessional! Don't bother with this place ever location has a different cancelation fee others not! Also fees will still be taken out even after you cancel which makes no sense at all!! check BBB on reviews These people have no clue I called 4 locations they have different answers even recorded them also lair's just shameful!
5 When my dad wanted to see a copd specialist I googled many doctors and after lots of research settled on him. The best decision I could have made for him. He was informative and direct with my dad but not pushy. My dad is a 2 pack a day 50 years of smoking. He explained the benefits of quitting and how he could help get him there but told him it was his decision. The fact that he did not lecture him is why my dad listened.  Hopefully my dad decides to quit
5 I moved from Florida to the area, and was recommended to this practice from a friend that plays hockey. I currently see Dr. Mike Skiby, who's super personable and an excellent doctor, really concerned with the well being and rehabilitation of his patients. He takes his time reviewing each situation individually per the situation.  I will continue to go to and refer friends to this practice.
5 Die Hautarztpraxis von Frau Dr. Bosch ist nur wenige Minuten vom Hauptbahnhof entfernt und daher sehr gut mit Auto, Bus und Bahn erreichbar. Ich war hier nun schon mehrere Male und war mit der Behandlung immer zufrieden. Hier werden Allergietest, Lichttherapieren durchgeführt und sogar Piercings werden hier gestochen. Praktisch ist auch der Aufzug zur Praxis hoch, da die Treppen nicht mehr die neusten sind. Die Behandlungsräume und mehrere Wartezimmer sind auch immer sauber und scheinen sehr gepflegt zu sein.
1 I do realize that I did book this appt last minute, however when we arrived at 1250 (appt time was 1) we were told to wait for Brett. It is now 1:30 with no sight of Brett nor any help from the front desk person despite asking her multiple times to check with him. She actually had the balls to tell us to go back to Brett's massage room and knock on the door. How unprofessional to have the receptionist for a business ask the customers go and knock on the providers door. Either way, I left with no massage.
5 I had been playing a lot of tennis, then hurt my knee. I wanted to find a sports oriented Doctor and reviewed many bios. I chose Dr John Kearney at the Core Institute based on his work and experience and have to admit that after meeting him and having the MRI reading, examination and prognosis I was impressed beyond my expectations. He laid out and discussed with me the many options I had, answered every question I had and we worked out a plan. I strongly recommend Dr Kearney to anyone involved in an active lifestyle and athletics. His staff is excellent as well and extremely efficient.
5 The new building is great, especially compared to the old one, and the new building is only in its first phase.  Being new it is much for accessible than older hospitals including washrooms, although it is weird that the design has half a flight of stairs at the front door requiring an elevator to get to the main lobby for those who can't do stairs.  I am sure it varies from doctor to doctor but anytime I have been to WCH I haven't waited longer than 10 minutes, where at other hospitals like St Mike's and Sunnybrook I have waited more than 30 minutes past the scheduled appointment time but again, that might have more to do with certain specialists being busier than others.  I do find the staff and volunteers friendlier than most.
5 Excellent care. I had a terrible experience at a previous center. The staff is very qualified and take time to do a proper assessment of your condition. Highly recommend.
5 I was in a bad car accident a few months ago and was treated by Dr Libby and John Lyons for my back and shoulder injuries.  They both did a great job explaining my injuries and how the treatment would help.  I would recommend John Lyons and Dr Libby to anyone who has been injured in an accident or sports injury.  John Lyons is a great physical therapist, very knowledgeable and very professional.
5 The two physical therapists (Terry and David) I have worked with are amazing. They are both extremely knowledgeable, friendly, and go above and beyond what is necessary to help others. It was reassuring that they constantly kept asking me how I was feeling and where; I am sure they used this information to adapt to the circumstances day by day. I asked many questions and learned quite a bit while tending to my torn rotator cuff. If you are looking to trust someone with your body I highly recommend these two.
5 I originally went in for a massage with Dr. Davis.  I had been having neck pain for a couple of weeks as well.  She gave me the best massage I have ever had, and she was able to help with my neck pain.  I highly recommend Dr. Davis for any chiropractic or massage needs!
5 Dr. Jenni and her stellar team were my last hope. Last year, I called my insurance company and told them that I felt I was going to need another back surgery--or something--because the pain was, once again, becoming intolerable. They gave me the number to AFC in Desert Ridge. I went in broken and, after a year plus, I credit them with "keeping me together." There are so many helpful services and the guidance I have received from Dr. Jenni, Dr. Meg, and all of the staff there has been invaluable! I cannot thank them enough or recommend them enough!
5 It's a shame that other review was the the first one. Someone who has been to four different places sounds hard to please. Enough about that. I first hobbled in to therapy in 2012 after a severe compound fracture of the left tibia and 6 other bones in my left leg. Andrea and her staff have been there for my recovery every step of the way. Andrea has seen my recovery though three surgeries and to this day still continues with treatment.  Andrea is absolutely amazing at finding ways to motivate you and push you through the hurdles of recovery. Mostly your own mind. Her knowledge, strength and commitment are second to none. Not only will I continue therapy at Arizona Sports but I would, and have, recommended them to any and all. Sincerely,  Jason Foss Aka "Frankin Ankle"
5 This truly is the real deal... Experts in deep tissue massage that took my body to a whole new level. With all the options in Scottsdale for massage, look no further... I would definitely recommend Zingara to anyone with a sports injury, body pain, or just everyday kinks-n-knots.. felt like a new person after!
5 I am a first timer to Chiropractic Care and will never go anywhere else! Marcella goes beyond the adjustment to know you and what you need. The office is friendly, efficient and experts in their care. I even worked with Craig for PT in post radiation scar tissue manipulation with Graston Therapy. True professionals who will not disappoint!
5 Writing a review for an Urgent Care is difficult as everyone walking in is experiencing some sort of pain or discomfort that can make the experience less then expected. Today I walked in here and had never been here before. I was embarrassed and crying from a dog bite on my hand and there was a few people already waiting. From the check in to check out everything went smooth. The other people waiting in the lobby were being called back fast as I was also. The MA as well as the PA Peter explained everything to me thoroughly. They treated me with respect and told me what to expect from my injury as well as what to do in case the bite became infected even though the worst case scenario was unlikely. I came in here overwhelmed and left calm. So thankful for these providers today!   Side note- my mother stopped in here when she was visiting from Chicago a few weeks ago to get antibiotics for strep she caught while traveling and felt the same about her treatment here.   Definitely would recommend!
5 Soft tissue miracle worker!  Brilliant touch for diagnosing and restoring functional movement patterns in athletes.  I went to Scott three days before a 100-mile ultramarathon for medial tibial stress and peroneal muscle strain that had developed in the final week before my race.  Treating a repetitive stress injury so close to a race requires an extremely precise touch: sufficiently deep to clean the tissue, but light enough to permit the tissue to adequately heal in time for the start line.  Scott absolutely nailed it.  The tissue was sore for two days and ready-to-race on race morning.  I ran a hard race with no lingering issues from the RSI (finishing top 10 in a competitive, international field).  Scott's experience is clearly evident in his technique and his general knowledge.  During my running career, I have been treated by various sports doctors in LA, DC, Ohio, and Las Vegas (in LA, I routinely visited Meb Keflezighi's A.R.T. provider).  Scott is among the best practitioners I have ever encountered.  He takes the time to understand the underlying mechanics behind an injury and offers sound recommendations for improving functional movement patterns.  I could not more strongly recommend Scott Zelensky for sports massage and soft tissue injury.
5 A few years ago, I injured my hip during a vigourous cardio class. For a long time afterward, I had a lot of problems with it. I felt pain deep in the hip joint after only a minute or two of walking. I never sought medical advice because I thought, what could be done about it? What would I be told? Just "rest it", probably, right? So, I put up with the pain whenever I walked anywhere. My philosophy was that everyone in the world has their aches and pains, there's nothing that can be done.  One morning, the day after a long walk along the length of the Danforth, I woke up to a numb right leg and sharp back pain. This was sudden and serious enough to force me into action. I searched online and found a nearby sports medicine/physiotherapy/chiropractic clinic where I could get an immediate appointment - On The Markit. It was definitely embarrassing to explain that I had hurt myself four years previously and that I was only then looking for treatment.  At the clinic, I had four sessions of ART, "active release techniques", administered by  Dr. Serena Granzotto, a chiropractor. This involves very deep massaging while the muscle is in use. If I understand correctly, the goal is to break down scar tissue from the old injury which caused other muscles or tendons to get 'caught' when I walk.  Here is the big surprise: after only four sessions of ART, my hip pain was almost completely gone. I now have to walk for an hour on concrete sidewalk before I feel what I used to feel after just three minutes. I can't believe that so little treatment could make such an improvement to an old injury. Most of all, I'm shocked that a chiropractor and a physiotherapist could actually help me because I never had much faith in or respect for their fields of expertise.  Here's what I'd like to pass on to you: if you've got an injury or illness that bothers you, get treatment. Do it now! Don't be foolish like me: I hobbled around for four years for no reason. If you've been putting up with a chronic condition for a long time, do something about it!  On The Markit is a bright and spotless clinic located in Liberty Village just behind the Brazen Head pub. Leigh, the main guy at On The Markit, was really good during my initial appointment. Even though they treat plenty of professional, real athletes, I didn't feel out of place getting treated here. I came for four appointments within two weeks and my problem was dealt with. I was also given a set of exercises to do at home to strengthen my injured muscles. I'm not sure what the cost per visit was, since I have chiropractic coverage in my insurance, but the staff is really helpful so go ahead and call them for pricing info.
1 Dr. Wachs staff is incompetent. They seem to be fresh out of school,if even that. You can't get a straight confident answer. It appears that there's no office manager that's running that place. It's an absolute nightmare. Main subjects Lakisha (spell check) and Karen. Good luck to that office and it's success.
1 As good and friendly Dr. Suarez is - the frontdesk is awful, unfriendly and just forget if you need anything - you will die trying to get if from this staff. Trying for years  to overlook it as the doctor is great - but it is getting unacceptable and actually pretty costly to pay for their mistakes!
5 I found exactly what I needed in a Dr. here. I had been a patient here for years before recently moving to Oregon. I saw Dr. Rebecca Morin and P.A. Maura Tardis. They both were extremely caring and had the BEST bedside manner. I truly felt that they listened to me and wanted to do what was in my best interest, regardless of the reason for my visit. Maura is one of the sweetest, funniest, and talented women you will ever meet. The gals in the office are just as great! They could always get me in no matter how quick the notice was. I will really miss this practice now that I am out of state.
5 Wow ! My first time here and Im IMPRESSED. very polite service from the desk as well as the dr. They warned me about all costs ahead of time as i pay out of pocket. Same amount to go to urgent care but now i finally have a dr!  Also - ive been having allergy troubles since i MOVED HERE. The urgent care drs just give me a zpack and dont treat the PROBLEM. The dr here gave me a steroid shot & im actually clearing up already - that quick! I am SO bringing my whe family here from now on!!!
1 I will not go back. The doctor that insurance chose for me was over 45 minutes late. I saw tons of people get seen before they even wanted to put me in a room or tell me why my wait time was so long. Nurses or desk workers put me in a room and I could verbally here my doctor in the hallway gossiping loudly, talking about her husband, and what she was doing to be so late for her first appointment in the morning. Then as she was done, she spoke very loudly and not confidential in the room as she barely said sorry for being late. I witnessed her rolling her eyes as she in her mind was not at the appointment, wanting to speak more with the aid. She even made a huge sigh with ugh as she looked over my back with a lot of moles and that i should have them looked at, which I had done prior to this appointment. When has anyone ever expereinced a doctor saying ugh with disgust loudly?  My experience there was very unproffessional with the entire place even desk personal was loud, young, and obnoxious with gossip.
5 Very caring staff.  P.A. Mr.Fisher is the best.  They return your calls    Thanks Jackie!
5 I broke my shoulder in early December of last year. Depressed and not looking forward to months of physical therapy, my doctor referred me to Pritchette Physical Therapy.  I was happy to find out it was in Ahwatukee and that I wouldn't have to travel far, but I can say now that even if it wasn't nearby I would still come here for any physical therapy.    The atmosphere is very upbeat and friendly.  To my surprise it didn't feel like a chore to go as often as I had to.  The staff is great, especially Keith and Janese.  They really kept me motivated.
5 I am suffering with chronic pain in my upper back, neck and part of my face.  I went to different Doctors and no one has helped me the way Dr. Peter has helped me.  His knowledge is second to none. Dr. Peter helped me not only with the physical pain but with my emotional distress because of the chronic pain I  had been in for so long. I highly recommend him and thank him for being such a dedicated Dr. Thank you Dr. Peter Kobi
5 Dr. B is awesome me and my son have been going to him for 9 yrs my son has been seeing him since he was 4.my son loves him we couldn't ask for better and staff is great. And the massages by April and her staff are reasonably priced and awesome.
5 Always able to get in same day, never had to wait. The staff and doctors are caring and attentive. Respectfully listen to and answer all my questions as a new mom and genuinely seem to care for my child.
5 I first met the doc at a free seminar about the flu.  She provided useful information and an honest evaluation of the pros/cons of getting a flu shot.  Later we talked about nutrition.  She provide me with a no nonsense approach to weigh loss and encouraged me to give it a try.    I am happy to find someone in the medical field whose first reaction is not to write a prescription.   In addition, she doesn't seem to be the type of doc that would order unnecessary tests and run up the bill.
5 I have gone to many docs. But He is the best, right to the point! Simply  asks what is wrong and fixes you right up!  The BEST thing about him is , I have been seeing hime for around 3 years and have always gotten the appt time I request and ACTUALLY get seen at the time.. Your not stuck sitting in the waiting room for 30 mintues. ca  Cant ask for uch more than that, and I wont.:)
5 I had a laser hair removel treatment from Tisha Sudah here.  She was AMAZING!  She took her time and I had no pain or discomfort at all, unlike other places/techs  I have gone to.   I can't recommend her enough and the prices are very very reasonable.  Beats those other places that advertise just Laser Hair Removal and then give you a quote that is out of this world crazy expensive!   Thanks Tisha!
5 I came here for RMT treatment cuz I was having neck pain. After treatment my neck was a lot more loose and I felt less pain. The staffs were very friendly and knowledgable.  I will definitely come back for my next treatment. Also, the environment was very clean and Relaxing.
3 I purchased a Groupon voucher for a massage because of the positive reviews. My first impression of the place isn't spa like atmosphere but I'd give it a B-rating. However, the massage I booked with Lily was AMAZING. The quality of her service was impeccable which made me overlook the environment of the actual clinic. Overall, clinic can be improved with location or upgraded renovations but the service of the massage exceeded my expectations. Thank you Lily!
5 The only negative thing about Living City Health is that I didn't find it sooner!  I have been to MANY chiropractors and health clinics and LCH is by far the most impressive I have ever been to. A sleek yet warm atmosphere, the clinic is unique because it offers various services as well as classes and lectures. You also get a tag offering discounts at various retailers in the neighborhood.  I was SUPER impressed by Dr Elysse Pilon. I've never had a chiropractor be so attentive and spend so much time addressing my concerns in an eye-level fashion.
5 Started working out here a few months ago to try to improve my overall health. I work out 3 days per week following a customized workout plan that Drew has created for me. The plan changes every 3-4 weeks as I progress. After several months of training I couldn't be happier with the results. My muscle tone and strength is up and based on tests run at the beginning and more recently my fat % has dropped. I definitely feel much better on a day-to-day basis than I did before signing up with Speed & Strength U. I have been so satisfied that I have signed on through June.   I couldn't recommend Speed & Strength U and coach Drew more.
1 You'll become ill visiting this filthy clinic. Dr. Shi is uncaring & incompetent. They always want money for something. Hustlers. Not good for your health.
5 Cozy is pretty amazing. When I first started seeing her for therapy I was told "my method is a bit different. I try to find the cause, not just treat symptoms. Think of a car. You can keep changing the tire that always wears out fast, or you can let a profession look at it, get the alignment done, and fix the problem."  Although Cozy's methods are a bit different, she is very professional. I have never felt anything but relaxed and comfortable when being treated by her.       It's also worth noting that I am a sizable guy 6'2" 240# and the Meyer method works to get out those knots and ailments noone else can seem to get. I always leave walking taller, and more relaxed than I went in.
1 This place is a dive. My mother in law was transferred here about two weeks ago for post surgery care and physical therapy. My husband and I visit every day at numerous times of the day and never see any staff there to actually help. We had to change her bedding ourselves. Clean the room ourselves and change her bed pads ourselves. They refused her accurate physical therapy. Their idea of therapy is to get her out of bed every other day and wheel her around in a chair. I went to visit today and was told she refused her therapy. Upon speaking with my MIL, I find out that she has to put up a fight for her needs to be accommodated. She didn't decline her therapy. That's the only reason she's in there. The therapist made that decision for her. I'm calling my lawyer today to see what I can do to file suit for medical negligence. If possible, keep your loved ones away from here. Avoid this place at all costs!!!
1 Canyon Vista Acute Care is releasing a patient who is 100% unable to care for himself.  Even after I told these people that I was unable to properly care for this man they have insisted I pick him up by 10 AM Monday the 14th.  I have no idea as what to do as I am 68 years of age with my own Heart condition. Any help from Fox would be deeply appreciated.  Please help me.  Paul M Taulbee  You are very, very dishonest.
1 The wait time is ridiculous.  After 2 hours of waiting in the waiting room and finally being called into a room they insured me that dr. Yee would be in shortly to finally see me but that was not the case. I waited in the room for another hour and no one ever showed up. I finally gave up after waiting 3 hours to see the doctor! Let it be know I did have an appointment but I guess that didnt matter. Not the first time this has happened to me over there. I will deffinitly not be returning.
5 Dr linck is amazing! I have had neck issues since my car accident in December and in the 3 months I have been in physical therapy my pain is almost gone. I highly recommend this place and dr linck!!!
1 This place is so bad receptionist e. But the owner is horrible. The place is filthy All they want is your money Don't go to this pace
4 I recently purchased a Class Pass membership and Athletic Gaines offered a boot camp class so I signed up.  There was about five of us in class, all women. I'm a fan of the smaller, personalized group versus a class so big an instructor isn't able to assist you or correct your form.  I was told to grab two bands.  One I wrapped around my ankles and the other above my knees.  We then did some side steps, lunge type work.  After removing the bands we did some additional stretches, lunges, and turf work.  Then we moved into the weight area.  This is where my appreciation of smaller groups comes into play.  Dev'Ron the instructor assisted me in choosing what weights would work for me in the various exercises.  In this class we used dumbbells, kettlebells, exercise discs, power plate, and battle ropes.    This really is a state of the art facility.  There is a large turf area, weight training area and basketball court.  They also have have an in house physical therapist.  I'm not a parent but I appreciate what appears to be a comfortable waiting area if you are here waiting while your child takes a class.    I have to admit based on the name of the facility and the appearance, I did expect the boot camp to be a little different, not to say it wasn't a good workout, because it was.  I think I just expected higher intensity.  Dev'Ron did say every class is different and my review is only based on the one class.  That being said I think $99 is a fair monthly rate for personalized small group training.
1 Updated on 8/22 - After 2 weeks and three calls into the practice, I still don't have the prescription refills that were suppose to be sent to my pharmacy. This place is just so incredibly disorganized and ran by complete idiots - AVOID this practice at all costs.   I don't even know where to start with this "Practice." The people running this office do not understand how to run a business.   1. Wait times to get seen: 45-60 Minutes after scheduled appointment time with additional wait time to see the doctor. The first time I visited this office was for prescription refills and it took nearly 2 hours to get in and out. I saw the doctor for all of 5 minutes to explain I just needed refills for meds I've been on for 10+ years. 2. Phones: Try getting someone on the phone - WOW it's a full time job. I had to call 8 times to get my appointment rescheduled because I kept receiving voicemail.... I finally got a call back and got it completed, but the effort I had to put in was unbelievable.
5 This facility is beautiful, food is awesome,nurses are fantastic.rooms beautiful, feels like a hotel not a rehab center. I highly recommend  this facility
5 My insurance changed as did my doctor. After extensive research, chose Dr. Bennett, and what a great choice that has turned out to be.  Her staff is very friendly and professional. Her assistant Debbie is wonderful to work with providing as much information as I have needed to make me comfortable with my healthcare decisions, and has been very available for follow up questions. I had to call her twice one afternoon (got through to her both times), and she was so patient with me each time.  I know how busy she is, so it was very impressive!  I've seen some of the unflattering reviews and felt absolutely compelled to offset the negative responses! It's funny how some will write what they would never have the nerve to say in person. Technology courage is actually very cowardly, because by simply addressing concerns BEFORE posting, issues could be very easily resolved avoiding such drama.  10X as many will complain vs. compliment, so there is definitely an unfair advantage to those being reviewed. Because of this, I am taking the time to express my appreciation... as a New Patient. I actually preferred the appointment prior to the Well Woman because it gave me the chance to get to know my doctor before sliding to the end of the table :)  Dr. Bennett is very compassionate, thorough, patient and knowledgeable. I am thrilled to have found a doctor I look forward to sharing my health concerns with, so refreshing!   I would recommend this practice to anyone who wants a great doctor!
5 Dr. Steve has done wonders for my overall health. I've been a patient for over three years and I'm virtually pain free. My neck, back and ankles are all in way better condition than previously which allows me to be very active and play competitive sports. If you're looking for a chiropractor in Arizona, Dr. Steve is your guy.
5 He is knowledgable and professional in his job. The wait time is little bed long, but I'm happy to have him as my primary Doctor .
4 I love Dr. Gunn and his staff. Nurses are great. Never a problem to get into the office for an appointment. If Dr. Gunn isn't available we see the nurse practitioner, Joan. She is equally as amazing. I have referred many friends and family. I've been a patient for about 5 years now and have switched my kids from their distant pediatrician over to Dr. Gunn. The only thing that kept me from 5 stars was when I had my gallbladder out I thought it would have been nice of him to check on me. I realize he probably has hundreds of patients, but a call or email from him, or one of the staff, would have been nice. Keep up the great work!
5 There is a good reason the place is chock full of NFL hopefuls, Olympians, champions and national teams...when it comes to training, whether you are looking for sport-specific training or simply for overall health, Athletes' Performance has no rival. It is expensive, yes, but worth every penny. Their approach is completely integrated - they will oversee nutrition, training, psychology, and recovery in a world class facility. They are extremely scientific and very cutting edge; their staff also contributes significantly to the research community.   I was fortunate enough to live in the Phoenix are for 9 months and cannot speak well enough of their staff or their programs. You'll come to improve yourself and will end up drinking the kool aid! Once you get in the swing of things it's hard to get enough of this place, and I shockingly found myself actually looking forward to arriving there before sunrise 6 days a week (ok, a bit later on Saturdays). My physical condition and overall health improved at a breakneck pace and I had a blast doing it!  If you're motivated and fortunate enough to train at AP here are a few tips: Chris Brown makes the world's tastiest post-workout shake, the nutritionist Simin Levinson is a wonderful person and an excellent cook, so take her advice on kitchen matters, and if you can get your massages done by Eric Ford, do so - it will hurt but the man is a truly gifted healer.  I just cannot gush enough about this place. It is worth saving up for either for yourself or for your athletic kids!
5 Dr. Docasar is amazing! We've been seeing her for years. We travel here from Arizona to see her. Their staff is awesome and the office is beautiful!
1 Horrible service they always over shedule, if you have an apointment unless is the first one you are in it for 2 hours wait, my dr she is great very nice person but they have no respect or regard about how important time is.
5 Awesome place! From the moment you call until you are seen and on your way out, you can tell that the staff and chiropractors believe in seeing you happy and healthy. The ladies at the front are more than just professional, they are sincere and that is sometimes hard to find these days at check in. I have never found the place to be overly crowded and I am taken in right away. I like the new location and the parking is adequate. I drive 45minutes across town to meet with Dr. Trinka because he is great at what he does! I was referred by a family member and have since referred three other people, all of whom had positive experiences. I have had bad experiences as a kid who got injured in dance and had rough and tough chiros who never took the time to make sure I was all aligned from head to toe.. Dr. Trinka is a large guy but not intimidating-- he is gentle and thorough with each session and I always leave feeling like my pain has subsided. A+++ Would definitely recommend again.
5 This a great childrens health clinic. No long lines, no dirty waiting rooms and angry receptionists. Its a great place to take your child for non-emergent conditions like a sore throat, cough, asthma, circumcision, vaccines, check ups etc... The doctors are compassionate and spend a great deal of time with each patient. Ask for Dr. McGhee he is a great pediatrician.
5 Through acupuncture and by providing me with stretches and exercises, Dr. Farian alleviated my troubling shoulder pain that had hindered my ability to play baseball for two years. It is such a relief to be able to throw painlessly and confidently again. Thanks, Dr. Farian!
1 My father needed to go to rehab. The first time he was here the experience wasn't bad. Unfortunately he became very ill shortly after returning home and had to go back to the hospital. They said he needed to go back to rehab again so I chose Sante again (these trips were only slightly over a week apart). I told them specifically of the medication he HAS TO HAVE at night. It was documented. He was not given it which led him to get out of bed by himself, falling and incurring a skull fracture and 2 bleeders. Nobody from Sante notified me. I got a call in the middle of the night from the doctor at the hospital when he was being sent to ICU. Even now, well over a week later, Sante has still never contacted me. I went there to pick up his belongings which they packed themselves and put in storage. It took 40 minutes for someone to bring them to the front (they won't allow non-employees there) and they lost his glasses (his VERY EXPENSIVE glasses). I will never recommend Sante.My father's ability to function is forever damaged, he will now need a skilled nursing home.
5 So my wife found this place, off a groupon I think, and what a lovely find.  I went for my first time with her today, and was friendly welcomed into the class with a few helpful words from the teacher, Ron.  By the Ron is awesome.    If you are looking for a solid yoga workout with friendly staff to boot; look no further.  Highly recommended.
1 If I could leave zero stars I would. I'll keep this as brief as possible even though it's not been brief at all. 1. They shipped me the wrong item. 2. When I contacted them on a thursday they said they would send the right item. I asked if it would arrive by Xmas (it was a present) and they said they would check and call me back. They never called. 3. I emailed the following Monday- no response. 4. Called late Tuesday. Was told by a manager he couldn't access my record and the person who didn't call NE back Thursday would call me back. She actually did this time. 5. They hadn't sent the right item the prior week so I was told it would go out the next day (Wednesday- I had to have it by Thursday). I told them to forget it and cancel the order.  They insisted that they still send me a return label so that I didn't have to pay for the return of the wrong item. 6. Two days later no label. I called again and asked to speak to a manager. I was sent to the voicemail of the person who has been delinquent. Called back and got a manager who said I should receive the label later that afternoon. 7. It's now six days after the call where they said they would send the label and guess what?! NO LABEL!   I cannot conceive how at every single step in this process they have managed to perform poorly. Now I have the added aggravation of seeing their web ads every time I'm on the Internet. Because I purchased something there I guess their advertising is following me. This would be a good strategy if it didn't constantly remind me of the terrible service I received which led me to post this review.
1 worst doctor's office I have ever been too. They let the  answering machine answer calls for days on end and never call back! Left 5 messages. Prescribed me a medicine my insurance doesnt cover and 3 weeks later still have not changed it, The receptionist has no clue whats going on in office, acts like its her first day. I need referrals for specialists and told to call myself. I had medicine and finished it  and in so much pain and so dizzy and sick , yet I told doctor and they have done nothing. This place needs shut down. Reporting them to medical board
1 I know this is a very long review, but if you are looking for a clinic, especially for your children, please take the time to read this.  This clinic has 2 locations and according to the receptionist, the same staff works at both locations so I will write my review even though this horrible experience occurred in Mesa. Before I begin my yelp vent session, I would just like to say PLEASE AVOID THIS PLACE! I was so upset after our appointment today that I was literally shaking and stumbling over my words because I did not appreciate how my family was treated today.   We found this clinic a few months ago when my son was dropped from my insurance and needed to get his immunizations and regular check-ups. I was in graduate school at the time, so the best option was to find a clinic for my baby that gave us the option of affordable payments. The few times we came here, we never had a problem with the staff. Even with an appointment, we would still end up waiting for a while, but the nursing assistants were nice, and the Nurse Practitioner Jennifer was very kind and helpful. Although we would only make an appointment for immunizations, Jennifer would make sure the baby was measured and weighed, supplied us with print outs of his percentile information, and speak to us about his development and our concerns. For all of this, we would pay about $50.   We made an appointment for today at 4 o'clock, and we are not seen until 5:45. We were expecting the usual visit until the nursing assistant asks us if we are there for his immunizations or a well baby check up. I told the girl that we would like a check up as well if it was possible and she says very rudely " well what did you pay for?" I was like whoa.....??? excuse me? SO she goes on to tell us that we only made an appointment for his shots so I'm like ok? no biggie, if they don't want to talk to us about the baby then fine!   So in walks the Nurse Practitioner and to our surprise, it's not Jennifer. The NP (cannot remember her name) seemed nice at first. She told us we would have to make a separate appointment for the well baby check up and in my confusion I explained how Jennifer used to integrate everything into one appointment. From my explanation, she then sat down and began asking questions about my son's development. So I thought cool, this appointment will go like past appointments.   So after speaking with the NP, the rude nursing assistant comes in with the immunizations and tells us that our bill will come out to $75. Um, hm.. excuse me, I'm pretty sure we only pay $50 when we come here. She then says "well you can talk to Sam if you don't want to pay this". We all walk over to Sam, the receptionist, and nursing girl starts going off saying that we are refusing to pay the bill. Sam checks our records and tells her that according to our previous visits, we were only charged $50. The nursing girl throws a fit, gets angry because she wants to go home, throws the paper down and says " WELL THEN YOU GUYS FIGURE IT OUT", and slams the door. Wow, well that was professional.   I tell Sam that if this is causing her too much trouble then we will pay the $75, but I don't feel comfortable with the rude nursing girl giving my baby his shots. Sam then asks if we want the other girl (who used to always see us but happened to not be working that day) to see us next time. I tell Sam that she can call us back when she finds out about the other girl's work schedule.   As we're planning this out, the NP comes in and says that we need to pay the $75 because the well check up was $25. First of all, this pissed me off because she never made us aware that is was $25. And second, we explained to her how Jennifer integrated it all into one visit, so I figured we had an understanding. And 3rd, really? $25 to ask me five questions about my sons eating and pooping, and giving me advice that I already know. Totally not worth it. Plus, she never even gave me a print out of his height and weight percentile. We explain to the NP what our understanding was and she begins talking to us like we are idiots, going step by step over what she said. Look here lady, maybe if you took the time to talk to your patients, you would know that I am very well educated and I don't need to be spoken to like a 5 yr. old.   Anyways, the NP said she would do the shots instead of her assistant and rushed through it so she could go home. We paid $50, but felt super mad, irritated, and disrespected. I don't understand how this place hired such unprofessional people, and their lack of empathy and people skills make me wonder why they even chose the medical field. Thankfully my benefits from work are in effect in October so i can get a real pediatrician for my son. But for those who are in a bind and unable to be covered by insurance, please find another clinic! I would hate for other families, especially those with babies to be treated so poorly by these people
1 I've been to this walk-in clinic several times. Even though they had really bad attitude and long waiting times, it was still endurable due to its convenient location. However today i had this Doctor with last name Lei for the first time, who's attitude really insulted me as a patient. I got there by 4pm today and when I finally saw Lei it was around 5:50 (they close at 6pm). Lei obviously seemed like he was ready to run home and didnt care a thing that I said and even questioned me why would I even be there with extremely rude attitude........... Worst doctor Ive ever seen or imagined seeing...
5 My father came to Life Care Center of Scottsdale on two separate occasions for a chronic condition exacerbated by Parkinson's Disease. The staff was exceptional - everyone from the receptionist, to the nurse, to the case manager, to the physician on staff to the physical therapist. Victoria Furst, the facility administrator, took time to understand my father's condition and made sure he had the team to support his recovery.  It is never easy to see a loved one's health begin to decline, but knowing that this facility exists removes so much stress. I knew my father was cared for and watched over. I would highly recommend Life Care Center of Scottsdale to anyone who needs this type of assistance.
5 This place is a one stop recovery location.  Jeff and Steve are good people and quality chiropractors. Lauren's PT gets you back in your game quick while Louise kicks butt on the massage table.  On top of all of that, now they offer B12 injections!   At this rate they may take over the entire world! #TotalDomination
1 If there was a way to give no stars at all then I definitely would instead of giving one. This place is absolutely horrible! Most of the staff is extremely rude, unprofessional and unfair. My daughter went to get surgery for her cleft palate last year in August. The staff in the room where they take her before giving her an actual room, was completely helpful and nice but once we got into the children part of the hospital, the staff seem like they didn't give a care.  My daughter was still a baby, she didn't even turn one when she had gotten the surgery & I desperately needed help from her father but what they had told me is that they are not aloud to have two parents by the bed, only one even when I told them I needed the extra help. I literally had stayed up past 24 hours to accommodate and tend to my child because of their so called rules.   Not only that but these nurses did not put her iv needle in her hand very good. I had noticed that the needle had slipped out of her vein and was just under her skin so her hand had swollen up and I had to keep her hand elevated for more than 3 hours so it can go down....  I do not recommend going there for your children. For adults,  I have a friend who has a father who has cancer and went to UMC as well. She said he was in so much pain there and treated him unkindly. They told him that they could not help him out and that he should ride out the pain. (No it has nothing to do with their insurance). She had him transferred to a different hospital and they are doing a lot more than what umc had done.
5 I went to Dr. Steve 2-3 times a week for 2 years while in college, his adjustments are always just what I need and the prompt service with a smile makes it even more pleasant.   Austin.  p.s. take extra time in the massage chairs.
5 The best massage in Charlotte for the money! Very talented therapist! Great atmosphere!
5 Wow. Impressed.   Switching doctors is difficult for me, I have a weird sense of loyalty to all my doctors. But just like an ex boyfriend, if you can't meet my needs there are plenty of other fish in the sea. Chose this office because their close to home and all the online reviews were great.   One thing that makes this place a great choice is convenience. Three floors jam packed with every kind of doctor you can imagine. They have primary care physicians, dermatologists, physical therapists, dietitians, podiatrists, radiologists and the list goes on and on. It's a one stop shop, unlike my previous doctor who had to outsource everything. Going to several different offices and waiting is a thing of the past for me now.  I have never experienced such a high level of care, ever. I came in contact with at least 6 different employees, they were all shockingly pleasant. Everyone was helpful, happy to answer questions and likable.   The doctor diagnosed a problem I have been having for years in less than 30 minutes with his bare hands. No x-rays, tests or samples needed. I feel terrible that at first I didn't believe him, since I had been diagnosed previously with something completely different. After he told me the problem and his advise fixed it, I realized that my doctor--he's the man.   I have been recommending this place to everyone. If you are suffering and nobody is able to make you feel better (like I was), definitely come here for a second opinion. Once you call in and tell the receptionist what your concerns are she will get you with the right MD or DO (I saw a DO) and I'm pretty sure that these doctors are the 'elites' of the medical world.   My research showed that only one in 5 doctors hold the title DO. They are able to diagnose, perform surgery and everything in between. They take a hands on approach and for me it got a little 'uncle touchy' but I have never came across a doctor who could tell me what's wrong with me by touching me everywhere and moving me about and asking me 'does this hurt, does that hurt' etc. Not only was I shocked that he figured me out so easily, everyone I have told is floored as well. Ever since my visit, I couldn't be happier. Thanks to my doctor and his team I have been doing great.
5 These guys are the real deal! I've had recurring shoulder injuries for years, and they were always treated the same way. Regardless of the PT I went to, the diagnosis was the same, as well as the prescribed therapy to help me recover. While the pain would gradually subside, it never completely went away, and would inevitably return after any excessive use of my right arm.   After 4 months of very limited motion in my right shoulder, I decided to try something different. Biomechanix wasn't in my insurance network, but I heard great things about them, so I paid out of pocket and took the chance. Worth every penny. The vibe is very friendly, and everyone there is extremely knowledgable and helpful.   My therapist, Craig Galbasini took me through a variety of movements to assess the problem, and then showed me some exercises to help address my mobility limitations. If I'm being honest, I was pretty skeptical of what he asked me to do because the exercises weren't very flashy, and didn't seem to be directly related to the area I was feeling pain.   I went along with it and kept wondering in the back of my mind when we were really going to get to work. After 4 treatments, (FOUR!) the pain had all but gone away, and my mobility is better than it's ever been. He didn't just band-aid the issue, but found the root of the problem and took care of it. I'm going on 90+ days now and have not only returned to the gym and normal activity, but I don't have to nurse my right arm like I did before. Mobility and strength has improved dramatically, and I learned a lot about how to protect and maintain shoulder health going forward.  Bottom line: You owe it to your body to get help from the best. These guys are the best.
1 The worst service I had in a long time I had an appointment at 1:30 pm and I'm still waiting and it's 2:01 PM. I asked the nurse why is it so long wait and she told me be relaxed that's how we work!!!  I do not recommend to come here in your life
5 Always very kind, and professional. Great services, I especially love the birthday massage. The doctor is friends with every patient and you can tell that he really cares about your health and well being!
1 What a waste. Stopped by 4 weeks ago and provided a copy of insurance card and drivers license. They were listed in the Humana booklet but wanted to make sure. The gal up front stated she will verify coverage and call back in 24-48 hours. She never called back. Although they were closer to home and "in network", after waiting 7 days,  decided to look elsewhere and found Advanced Neck and Back Pain on Ocotillo road. Even though they are 'not in network" they have been great. Have been going there for three weeks, and they are helping to prevent any additional costs other than normal co-pays. They offer Chiropractic care, Physical Therapy, and massage, all under one roof. If your looking for a highly regarded practice, check out all the reviews. That should help making your decision real easy. Plus they have Saturday hours. Ken
5 After neck injuries from gymnastics, poor posture, and working out (pulling my muscles in many different directions)....I suffered from back pain and neck pain on a regular basis. I am a healthy person and didn't think I needed to see a chiropractor, but after taking a leap a faith and trying it....my back and neck pain is almost non existent, my posture has improved, my sleep is better, and only after 6 months!  I encourage everyone I know to go see Drs. Chris & Sonya - they are amazing at what they do!
1 IF YOU VALUE YOUR TIME AND YOUR CHILD'S HEALTH, STAY AWAY FROM THIS OFFICE.   I changed my pediatrician to come to see Dr. Robertson after being recommended by a good friend of mine. The 1st time I came to this office, I waited over 2 hours after getting my son undressed in a cold office. He was only getting some shots. Dr. Robertson was very rushed and not very friendly. My son did not like him. He diagnosed my son with an ear infection and prescribed antibiotics even though he had no symptoms of being sick. I started my son on them and sure enough after he was done with the 10 day dose he got sick. So, I ended up going to an urgent care and he ended up on antibiotics again.   So, I decided I would try this office again. Called-Followed the prompts for the SW location and provided my sons DOB and name. They made me an appointment for the next morning with a  doctor I was not familiar with. I was unfamiliar with all the doctors as this was only my 2nd time visiting. Went to the office 15 minutes early. After 20 minutes, I was advised that I made the appointment for the Summerlin Office. Um no I didn't, I made it for SW location. Why the hell would I take my son to another office when he sees doctor Robertson normally. So, they advised Dr. York was working and they would check with him if he could get me in. My son was sick, goo eyes, tugging on ears, low grade fever. Let me add he is only 1 years old. He does not do well sick. So, they finally asked Dr. York and they told me I could wait another hour and they would try to work me in. Or.. I could drive to Summerlin. This was not my mistake, it was theirs and they were punishing me and my son at this point. Let me add, I was there at least 30 minutes and never was there anyone in the waiting room. But, I was going to have to wait another hour.   This office is a joke. The office people were jerks, the doctor is overworked and too busy and they will just send your sick kid away as they take breakfast breaks or something. Go somewhere else.
4 My family and I have been going to see Dr Houlihan and Dr Lonquist for 16 years.  I find their office staff to be helpful and efficient.  They have always made me feel welcome and have made every effort to fit us in as soon as possible.  I have never waited more than 24 hours to see one of the doctors or a NP.  Emese and Emily are great, comforting, professional, and trustworthy.  I sincerely appreciate that they respect my wishes to limit the prescription medication introduced to my family, unless it is truly necessary.  Whether serious health concern, virus, or sports physical everyone at Estrella Mountain Medical Group has been there for my family. Thank you Estrella Mountain Medical Group!
5 After a 7 year wonderful relationship with Dr. Nava.....suddenly things took a turn for the worse this year regarding their staff. Again - I repeat Dr. Nava was one of the best doctors I have ever had. My concern is that his staff is not serving the Doctor's best interest when fielding phone calls and addressing patient's concerns.
5 Our family of 5 has been seeing Dr. Piccione here for a couple of years now and we ADORE her.  She is so down to earth and really knows how to talk to patients. Especially kids! It drove me crazy when other doctors would talk to me about my children like they weren't in the room. Dr. Piccione has meaningful conversations with all 3 of my kids (ages 8, 6, & 3) and involves them in their own care. She's honest and makes them feel so comfortable.   My husband and I love her too. I trust her when she says "yeah, let's check this out, go get some blood drawn" and just as much when she doesn't jump to prescriptions or expensive lab work when it's unnecessary.   So often the office staff and nurses are a drawback to an office, even if you love the doctor. We have always been treated with the utmost respect and caring by every single person in the office. The nurses are so good with children. My daughter didn't even realize she'd gotten a shot yesterday! That's how sweet and gentle (and master of distraction!) our nurse was.   I know, the scheduling drives some people bonkers. I think it's a love/hate kind of thing. It totally works for us.  I don't think it's really fair to give them 1 star because folks don't like their scheduling policies. I actually like that when we need to be seen, we can always get in today or tomorrow. Our last ped. wouldn't schedule all 3 of my kids the same day in case we cancelled and left a hold in their schedule. Not very patient-centered. And that whole "our scheduling calendar opens next month, at which time you can remember to call and schedule a well-check for three weeks after that..." business that the pediatrician before that used was just as bad.   I have tons of friends who love both Drs. Luba. We tried to get in with her, but she wasn't taking new patients. I'm so glad we didn't-- otherwise I never would have found Dr. Piccione. She'll be our family physician for life! (Please don't move away, Dr. P)
5 From the front desk, to all of the doctors I could not express how amazing this facility is! I called them at 8 am on a Monday morning in excruciating pain (I could barely even walk) and they took me in immediately  by the time I walked out I was able to move and the pain decreased significantly. They are the best!
5 I'm here at St. Luke's  emergency room with my friend and wanted to let everyone know that the staff here is amazing! The main doc was great.  The male nurses are fine as hell.
1 I have been a patient with Dr. Sbaih for over three years. Unfortunately, I will be looking for a new doctor. Dr. Sbaih is very caring, very intelligent and I really like her as a doctor, however, a two hour wait is ridiculous. Her office staff is horrible. Yvette in particular is rude, dismissive, and seems to forget that she works in a doctors office. She has absolutely no compassion or empathy. I have had to drive to the office to handle problems with prescriptions twice. You cannot reach this office over the phone at least 70% of the time. A callback is out of the question even when you leave a message with the answering service. I am sorry to say I will be looking for a new doctor.
2 Classes are good but everyone who works there is rude. I feel uncomfortable every time I walk in there. No acknowledgement whatsoever at the front desk. The yoga teacher and receptionist are busy chatting away about what they are doing later that night. Won't even look at me as I am standing there waiting to pay. Nice facility and decent classes, but terrible customer service.
1 i went to arrowhead health center for my ostro-arthritis. i was told by dr. kentg d. vosler that i needed braces.  adrenne in the brace department told me my insurance would pay for this.  now they want $1,700 and also had down $7,000 for braces. i called the company that makes the braces and was told that the insurance price is $1,200 to 1,735 and cash from me should be $605.oo.  i think this is way out of hand.  i would be very careful with dealing with these people.  they have no right to demand such a great amount.  i believe they should rethink what they are trying to charge people.  i will take this up further with other people that will be able to help get this settled.
1 Waited over two hours to see a doctor despite being early for appointment time Nice staff but not worth that kind of wair
5 Great doctor with very big heart she is always trying to do her best to help her patient to get the right way to get well I love this doctor God bless her
5 Dr Hirst is amazing! I was referred by my friend who didn't have anything but good things to say...and now I'm right there with her!   I've been going to a chiropractor for years and just moved into the area this January, became pregnant and super sick, so I haven't seen a chiropractor in months. I'm just so relieved and grateful that I was able to find Dr. Hirst and his staff because the amount of back and neck pain was becoming unbearable!! I was able to walk out with an air of lightness because of the amount of pressure that was released.   Thank you thank you thank you!!!
4 Dr Jurani has a good bedside manner and his staff is considerate. The wait time is very, very long so plan to spend a couple of hours. I still recommend this office.
5 Super friendly,  Staff is filled with great energy, nothing but great vibes.  They educate you really well on what they can do to help you.  I've been going there for three weeks now & love it!
5 I'm happy to have found this practice.  The doctors are very thorough, knowledgeable and patient.  They take the time to answer your questions and tailor your treatment to your specific needs.  I felt results after the first visit.  Also, the office staff and therapists are very friendly, skilled, and helpful.  I have already referred family members to this center.
5 Dr Bonin is the best!   He is very knowledgable, caring, and he listens to his patients. I have been under his care for 2 years.  Most recently I had horrible pain down my left side: neck, back and even my arm. Also bad headaches. After going to Dr Bonin for an adjustment, the pain was gone within hours. The office also uses amazing technology to easily see areas of concern and chart your progress. Schedule a consultation with Total Lifestyle Chiropractic today....you won't be disappointed!
5 I have to say that It was a great experience from the moment I walked through the door.  I really needed to see a doctor in the walk-in clinic.  The lady at the desk was very welcoming and professional. She was not texting on her phone or distracted at all when I explained why I was there.  The waiting area is very nice. The seating is comfortable.  When it came to my turn to see the doctor, which I must say wasn't a long wait at all, I was guided to an exam room.  Dr Hussein was the one that saw me.  He asked me all the right questions, was very professional, yet had a laid back approach, which was a good thing.  I was also looking for a family doctor and he helped me book my next appointment for a "meet and greet".  At this appointment he took a brief medical history of me which I never had done with my previous doctors.    I look forward to seeing him again for any other issues that may come up.  I also can't wait for their pharmacy to be completed as it will be so convenient for me if I need to get refills for my prescriptions
2 This location has changed my experience with Dr. Izenberg. He is the only reason I am now a patient at this office. Previously there wasn't much wait and things went smoothly at his old location. At the new location I wasn't able to see the Dr. Until 1.5 hours after my scheduled appt. think twice before scheduling if you have other things you need to accomplish that day.
5 I have been seeing Anne Marie for years as my massage therapist. She was recommended by my doctor, who uses her too! She not only gets to the heart of the issue at hand but offers me advice on how to help fix the issue outside of the visits. I recently saw Kevin for chiro, who is also a very talented physiotherapist. Ann Marie recommended I see him for an issue in my ribs that I had been dealing with for months. I would never have considered chiro as a way to deal with this. But two visits with Kevin and my scar tissue has healed and I'm getting back to the gym! What a great team!
5 Everyone is super nice here. I was very happy with my experience at this facility. Highly recommended!
5 Dr. Matin  is the best doctor, always taking extra time , ordering tests and trying to help you with whatever is wrong! Office staff is the best! Hours are great!
5 I am a member here, which is totally worth the money.  Every time I go here, I have had a different massage therapist. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM IS FANTASTIC!  I have never had less than a wonderful massage there.  They also occasionally run specials, which makes it even more affordable.  They also have appointments pretty much all day Saturdays and Sundays, which makes it really convenient.  I love this place and will continue to go on a regular basis.
5 I had a really bad stiff neck last weekend so I called few places hoping to book for a message therapy ASAP. I got an appointment easily with Jacky and his attention to details is fantastic! He can gently but effectively release the muscle soreness . He works magic! :)
1 If I had an option of giving no stars, I would. I called in to make an appointment. They asked me for my insurance card and I asked them to verify to see if the insurance will  pay for the service. This was on friday. On monday I called and they said yes, you are good to go. Few weeks later I get a bill in the mail for $171 to pay for the service. I think that's awful costumer service and I will never go there again and also pass the word to my doctor not to refer anyone there since the doctor asked for my input. Very disappointed.........
5 I have been doing Pilates the past few months and love it! Trish and Brenda are great instructors and have passion for what they do. The studio is beautiful and relaxing to work out in. I highly recommend Pilates Element!
4 I have had lower back problems for a number of years now. However I always put it off, telling myself it would go away, until one day it go so bad, and I was so sick of it, I decided to do something about it. After being turned away by several doctors, telling me it was just postural and there wasn't much I could do, I eventually decided to seek help elsewhere.  I'm glad I did. I have been going to the Edinburgh Physiotherapy Centre since.  I have since leaned a a lot about my problem and my treatment there has done wonders. Having had both their sports massage and physiotherapy services I have had some experience of this excellent medical centre that offers a range of services aimed at sorting out your physical shape.  The centre has physiotherapists, osteopaths, chiropractors made up from a very professional team. They are particularly good at not only poking and prodding out but also telling you what is going on and what they think is wrong with you, making extra recommendations and giving advice whenever possible. The centre can also give alternative treatment such as acupuncture, again carried out with utmost profession (I can speak from experience).  In an ideal world, prices would be a touch a cheaper, but compared to other physio in Edinburgh it remains competitive. The receptionist staff are always really friendly and we have a good chat.   If you are having back, or any other chronic pain, I highly recommend getting it sorted before it drags on. The Edinburgh Physiotherapy Centre is a good start.
5 I have been going to Wellness Body Wraps for several months now. First and foremost, I have to give Julie, the owner, a shout out because she really does an amazing job with great customer service, keeps her studio nice and clean plus she decorated the place so nice!! She has relaxing music videos (or Netflix if one prefers) in every room and I truly get to relax during my appts. I have been doing the wraps and the body vibration and it has made a difference!! I dropped 17.5 pounds since January 1st. I haven't changed much as far as diet and exercise. I do try to eat okay and get some exercise but I did not step things up to lose weight even though I wanted too. Today I tried the Sauna which is new to the studio. That was awesome too!! She is offering other services such as teeth whitening and facials so that is next on my list!! Totally recommend this health studio plus the prices are very reasonable!!
1 I went here after being involved in a rear end collision.  When we walked in, we found the receptionist with her feet on the desk and a few Mac Cosmetics boxes scattered on the desk.  She was having a conversation with another staff member about non work related stuff.  1st question; Are you guys together?  Ummm yeah we walked in together and we were talking to each other so common sense should have told him and her that we were definitely together.  I explained that I had been in a car accident.  She just looked at me and handed me the paperwork.  She also said " complete this and bring your id, credit card, and insurance card up when you are done".  I'm confused because the reviews stated that the front desk staff was caring and nice.  This definitely isn't the treatment that I received.  Also, why would I give you my credit card information when I have Blue Cross Blue Shield which covers everything??  I waited to see how she greeted the next lady that walked in and it was the same attitude.  So, we walked out and I let her know exactly why.  One thing I cannot tolerate is horrible customer service.  It doesn't take very much effort to be nice and smile. We went to Fastmed and was greeted by a friendly staff.  Oh yeah! Fastmed didn't ask for my credit card information either!!
4 Great Doctors I have to say! They actually take the time to listen. I will say their staff Very unprofessional and very rude . ( because of staff MINUS 1 star )
5 Dr. Dom & Dr. Matt are great.  Arcadia Health & Wellness fixed my hip problem and got me running again!
5 Wow, an amazing experience from start to finish. Walk-in clinics are usually depressing places where you have to deal with an indefinite wait time and moody staff. Not here!  The front desk staff were super friendly and checked me in promptly. They gave me an estimated wait time which was far less than other clinics, and I sat in the pleasant, bright waiting room.   Ten minutes later (bear in mind this was at 8:30am on a workday) I was seen by an awesome, friendly doctor and sent on my way with everything I needed.  Truly a first class experience and I will be back soon. The fact that it's on my way to work certainly helps!
1 This is my fist time ever writing a review but I felt like  I needed to take the time to do it since this revolves peoples health and well being.  I have been going to kachina family practice for over a year now and have had multiple bad experiences.  In my opinion, they are extremely negligent and seem to care much more about making money than caring for their patients.  After having lab work done, they have never once called to report my results. I have to call over and over again until I finally get a response. They tell me that in order to speak with a doctor I will have to make another appointment and if you leave a message for a doctor, don't expect to get a call back.  If you are lucky you will get a call back from a medical assistant who knows nothing about your health records or why you came in in the first place.  My last lab results were very abnormal with some very high levels.  I called for three days straight, left three voicemails, 2 web. emails and then finally got a call from the medical assistant. It then took 3 more phone calls and me threatening to leave the practice and go to a different doctor in order to get a doctor to speak with me about them.  This is so upsetting and so negligent.  My family and I have moved a lot and so I've seen many doctors over the years and I've never experienced such negligence and lack of respect and care for patients.  My husband who is an extremely positive person has not liked the practice from day one.  DON'T GO TO THIS PRACTICE!!!
2 I was very disappointed by the service received by this clinic.  Felt like it was understaffed, and I was pushed through as quickly as possible. The Dr. Is great... However always felt rushed in and out. They also billed my insurance company rates they would not compensate me for... So I ended up having to pay the overage out of pocket.  Overall taking my business elsewhere.  Feel like they stuck it to me- and my insurance company.
5 I bought a Groupon for a massage and it was worth the discounted rate and they offer an amazing deal for a second massage $25 that they tell you about after your 1st massage.  My therapist has been doing massages for 25+ years.  She did a great job.
1 This place is amazing! They are so good that you won't even have to see the doctor, just the waiting room will heal all your pains and sickness! Have a cold? By the time you see the doctor your running nose and sore throat have already healed! Have a laceration? You either already died of blood loss or your cut has healed. Your toddler is running a high fever? He will be a teenager by the time they call your name and teenagers have much better immune system!   This place is another testament to the miracle of nature. Does it practice western or eastern medicine! Neither, you ignorant fools! This place uses the healing power of the fourth dimension - time - to heal us vulnerable mortals!  *waited 5 hours with my dad*
1 Should have listened to the Yelp reviews. This place suuuuucks, but it was the only place open on a Saturday around me. Looks nice on the outside but terrible on the inside. The staff is mostly unfriendly as well.   I waited 2 hours in the waiting room with the same infomercial looping over and over in a creepy 2-TV stereo sound, only to be greeted by a hoodlum male nurse who leaned all over the counter and mumbled. I waited probably another 20 minutes for the nurse, who was actually very nice, but very young. The hoodlum came back to try to take my blood and he couldn't figure it out, so I asked him to stop so I could go.   3 hours later I got a simple prescription. Should've looked for a CVS Minute Clinic.
1 Awful experiences at this place. Staff is rude and doctors are impersonal. These practitioners seem to want a lot of pointless follow up appointments. Wait times at this office are unpredictable and they now require a debit card linked to your account so if your insurance denies coverage over something they can automatically charge you. The only good thing about this facility is they have the capability to do certain labs and testing on site which saves you a visit somewhere else.
1 I made an appointment and I still had to wait over an hour and a half to get in. Then i am greeted and brought to the back room, and the nurse came in for 2 minutes, left again and still had me waiting, just in a different room. As of right now I am waiting to be given discharge paper and it has been over 3 hours since my appointment time. Never returning to My Dr. Now.
5 I am a bit confused as to why this place did not receive an overall 5 star review. They were wonderful. I went yesterday morning, Tuesday February 1 around 8:30am. There was already a full house as I expected, seeing as how it's an urgent care, they're always packed. The woman at the desk was very friendly, she told me that I was "in the right place, just sign in, take a seat, and we will be with you shortly". I waited about 10-15 minutes and was called back by another friendly counter gal named Jess. She took down all my info (instead of having to deal with me filling out all that boring paperwork) and then sent me to sit back in the lobby. Another 10 minutes went by and a gentleman RN called me back. He took my Weight, height, BP, HR, and talked to me briefly about what was going on etc. I was then sent to a patient room where I waited for the doc, another 10 minutes. The doctor and nurses were AWESOME! Very thorough, very understanding... I felt as if I should've come to UMC Quick Care instead of battling with my primary for the past 2 months! Anyhow, I ended up receiving a breathing treatment as well ( I was in for respiratory problems), and was even given a run down of all my prescriptions and when and why to take them, and they even gave me a doctors note for work! I was VERY pleased with the care I received at UMC Summerlin. All in all, people need to have patience as this is an Urgent Care so there is a first come first serve basis and people also need to realize that 20 people could walk in at any given moment. Thank you UMC Summerlin, your team was awesome!
1 Helpful physical therapy, but staff members standing around, doing nothing but blathering about their ignorant political opinions is a major turn off. No one cares about your view on the federal administration or the " media bias", we're just here to get healthy, so maybe help a customer so the "guvment doesn't have to bring back your jerb". Literally no one cares about your Facebook politics, whichever direction you lean, so put on your adult pants, figure out what topics aren't appropriate for a work place, and just stop. Bummer that one routinely mean mugging employee can make an otherwise helpful experience so unpleasant.
4 I brought my son here shortly after being born. Dr. Gerald Golner was FABULOUS! He was very thorough, and very supportive. My son is small (weight) for his age, always has been. Dr. Golner never made us feel like we were at fault, our son is just little, and explained that because he was growing at the rate he was supposed to be, there was no need to worry about where he was on the standardized rating. Treated our son as an individual. Very efficient. Always answered questions, and returned calls personally within the business day. Never saw the problems other reviews had.
5 Best massage I've had in 30 years! Jim found muscles i didn't know i had, and he has years of experience in treating athletes. So happy i found him, kindest man. Would fly him to Texas if i could!
5 I was referred here by my doctor and it was the best referral. The team at Endurance is great and for the first time in forever, I am actually healing and can feel progress. I would highly recommend this facility to anyone that is in need of physical therapy.
1 My regular doctor had me taken here with an irregular heartbeat--I arrived in an ambulance.  I then spent 8 hours on a gurney, waiting for a room becaue of a nurse shortage.  After two days I hadnot seen a cardiologist.  The second day, the cardiologist sent over his nurse practicioner.  Wow!  Could you spare her!  The third day, my heart beat had stabilized, but Ihad to wait 2 hours to be discharged  for the big cheese cardiologist himself, who had not bothered to drop in, to see me so I could leave.  He was a slick hustler with dyed hair who called me "young lady" (he is not a young man himself) and talked to me for two minutes.  Ugh.  Id never go to this hospital again.  A summary:  one of the nurses got into an argument with a heart patient , with her voice raised, over how long people have to wait in emergency rooms.  I froze all night, and am covered with bruises from their inept staff taking blood.  Dr. Noori, an internist, was a gentleman and a good doc--hope he finds work elsewhere.  The idea of a cardiologist being too busy to see a patient and sending a frickin nurse instead, still makes my blood boil--avoid this place unless you are half-dead.
1 This place has the WORST service ever! First off, they managed to mess up the appointment two times. When the massage was first booked, they messed up and they called back to fix the mix up (They accidently put one of us under a facialist instead of a masseuse). When we went there, we were told that I wasn't booked. So my BF gave up his spot so that I could go in his place. That's not all...  My masseuse was 35 minutes LATE! 35 minutes....is a ridiculous amount to wait. Just as we were about to walk out...they said she would be just ONE more minute. Fine, so I just did it anyway.  In the end...she also shorted me 5 minutes of my massage.   Stay away from this place! Even though the massage was decent...the service was absolutely horrid!
5 Best physical therapy place in the area! It's a small space but that's not a problem. Mark, Shea and Justin are straight ballers as well. There's typically an assortment of baked goods on the back counter which can be had if you play your cards right.
5 Dr. Paige is amazing.  He is very nice, helpful and knowledgeable.  I crawl into his office and walkout after he has worked his magic.  We have been going to Dr. Paige for several years and are so happy.  I would highly recommend him, he has been life saver for both me and my husband.
1 Too bad you can't give out negative stars!  First visit here after being recommended by our fantastic physical therapist - been an hour since our appointment time and we have yet to even be checked in because the rude and condescending staff didn't seem to understand that my SO's ID was lost in the accident and even if we had gone to DMV already we wouldn't have a picture ID. If the specialist we are here to see today (if we even get to see them) is anything like the staff this will also be our last visit.   I've never understood how a medical office could function without competent staff - but this place seems to just run people through the mill and back out onto the street. Compassion, concern, and quality are not words that the front staff have in their vocabulary - especially Gaby. She doesn't seem to grasp the concept of multiple fax lines, the value of a patient's time, or customer service.  Emphasis can not be stressed enough on how rude and unsympathetic Gaby and the other members of the front office staff are.
2 Horrible wait times. I made an appointment for 3pm and was finally seen by Dr. Adams at 5:30.  The staff looked miserable and over worked.  When I asked if the wait times are always like this the girl that was getting ready to leave for the day laughed and said, "yes".   I dread having to go to her office if I'm feeling under the weather or needing a referral. I almost didn't go in for my last visit because I didn't want to sit in her office waiting for 2+ hours.   On a different note: I find Dr. Adams to be a a good Dr. She has always taken genuine concern with me. She just needs to have the office work on the patient wait times.   Unfortunately, I think it might be time for my family to find a new Dr. Office.
5 Dr T is the best, End of story. His 5 stars all day long! His staff is sweet and kind. I love Kiki she so professional and remember my name.
1 I would not give this place one star, they have sent me to a collection agency for $60.00 which they say I owe and I do NOT and I refuse to pay for a missed appointment which I did not miss-- so I am getting harassed for 60 bucks and put it on my credit report.  To make matters worse I thought  Dr Cohen was awful as a doctor.
5 Let me start by saying that every OSR is different.  I started at OSR years ago after a hip replacement and went to the Carefree location. I didn't love it because it was so busy and it was in the Mountainside Fitness gym. Every time I went I got a different PT. It was a love hate thing. I worked out and it was convenient.   I recently had a shoulder surgery and went to the Ice Den location and have been under Shaun Palmer's care. I will never go to another facility. Shaun and his entire staff are committed to my recovery. They are the best group to work with and Shaun is very knowledgeable and I trust him 100%. I would highly recommended Shaun and his staff!
5 I'm in love with the staff... seriously! I have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and when I first started seeing them they knew what it was but took it a step further and actually did MORE research before my second visit so not to aggravate any issues. Most therapists I've seen are like "oh yeah I know what that is" and make my symptoms worse, not these guys. 100% legit and not only know what they are doing but they show they know what they're doing. I've had cupping and dry needle therapy from them as well, AMAZINGLY KNOWLEDGEABLE STAFF! They put you at ease and make you feel like you've known them forever. They will always be where I go for my post-op care.
5 I'm leaving Charlotte and dreading finding a new doctor because Dr. Larsen has been a fantastic doctor for the past 2 years. Making an appointment is easy, the staff is fantastic. Dr. Larsen takes his time and answers questions. He's correctly addressed any medical issue I've had. In addition, if relevant for you, he's LGBT-friendly (I found him on the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association). I can't speak to the abilities of the female doctor there, whose name escapes me, but Larsen is gold!
5 Excellent service, great experience with the professional registered massage therapist. It doesn't look like these fancy spa centers, but focuses on the skills and performance. Highly recommended!!
5 My wife and I started going here after an auto accident and are very glad we found this office. The team is very friendly and they explain everything so you're not left in the dark. They've also been very pleasant to work with and work around my schedule. A wonderful team!
5 Laura you have changed my life! Words alone cannot express how much you have helped me overcome the pain in my entire body and to think it all started with focusing on my shoulder injury.  I so appreciate all the time you have taken to research everything that is affecting my total recovery. Every time I leave you I am in a better place. You have given me the gift of being able to always be in a better place mind, body and soul than I ever knew possible. Learning from you what you are truly dedicated to has given me the insight to heal. I love and appreciate the amazing technics you have achieved in excellence because you listen and really hear what will make the difference in healing every aspect of my life... Thank you for being the source to my openness and all things are possible! I am so grateful!
1 I have been going to this facility based on convenience for some time.  They have misdiagnosed several issues, their staff is unprofessional, and they do not create a feeling of safety.   It is always hit or miss on tbe doctor or PA which is the scariest experience of all.  After today i cannot in good conscience ever recommend this practice
5 Excellent doctors. Everyone is good here, no need to pick and choose.  Great service, fast, efficient, the secretaries sometimes seem harassed and rushed because they're always so busy, but they're friendly.  They know their stuff, they put prescriptions in digital format and everything is done as paperless as possible. AWESOME.
5 Tammy is amazing she has great energy and intuitions,. Amazing intention and helps you to release the negative and absorb the positive I felt very balanced and energetic  after our session I highly recommend Tammy!
5 I was looking for a new PCP since I'm new to the area and I saw Dr. Turner today. She was great! I might be biased be she was as much of a wildcat fan as me but she also answered my questions well. The checking in process was a bit annoying but when isn't it. Over all I am very happy with my experience and am excited to have Dr. Turner take care of me!!
1 The apsolute worst doctors office in my 52 years on this planet! If you have a refill never mind getting through to the office for the refill. The answering service answers all calls. The doctor and staff are the absolute worst. Trump please HELP!
1 Oh.... this place. There is a reason I stay away from doing negative reviews. However, this place has absolutely earned to be discussed, or be a topic of discussion for once in my yelp roster to help those in search for a women's medical practice.   From the time I walked in, the front desk receptionist was cold, short, and on the phone on a personal call while handing me a clipboard with papers to fill out. Standard. the wait was short. I was called in, weighed, then I was directed to a waiting room. I stayed in that waiting room for over and hour and a half. Finally when I came out to ask what the hold up was, they proceeded to apologize and tell me that the Dr. was called in for an emergency at the hospital. That is completely understandable. Emergencies are that, emergencies. However, you do not leave a patient WAITING without informing them of what is happening, or what are the options available. Let me, as a patient make the decision to wait or to reschedule. That is called basic communication between two parties. You are being paid to be there. I am NOT! With that said, I left. They told me I could reschedule, it was too late for that. I never went back. I called my insurance and told them to NOT pay any invoices if the office had the audacity to bill them. Waste of time, resources, and energy. Never again.
4 I definitely recommend this place -- in fairness, I have never been to PT before, but my take on the whole crew is that they are committed to what they do.  Great atmosphere and facility.
2 Let me start with the fact that the actual therapists were wonderful. However, I can't give this location more than 2 stars because the management and billing were so disappointing. I was charged more out of pocket as a patient with insurance than I would have been as a cash only patient. I called to speak with the owner about my concern and was never escalated past the front desk secretary. Although I was frustrated I was never rude, however I was spoken to very disrespectfully, not to mention I was NEVER contacted by the owner despite many attempts to contact him.   I ended up paying the full amount they asked for. I would advise anyone who thinks of using them to have the full disclosure, not just an "estimate" of charges before agreeing to anything. I always look at reviews to help me spend my money wisely, I wish someone else had posted this review before I was taken for so much money.
1 My husband and I, and some of our grown children have been patients here for a very, very long time. Over the past few years, not only has the quality of care steadily declined, but also the number of errors has risen to a level that has become unacceptable. You go in, and then spend weeks trying to straighten out the messes.  Like the others that commented here, the push to see the PA is always there. The last time I was in with my husband, I finally had to leave and go out in the parking lot, so I wouldn't go off on the PA. So much of what she said was just flat out wrong. I guess she assumes all her patients are clinically ignorant. I am not as this is my profession, but I am concerned for those patients who depend on them to be at least medically accurate and knowledgeable. On top of this, they want you to come way too frequently just to write prescriptions for maintenance medications. The PA told my husband that he might need to come in EVERY MONTH to get his medication for his hypogonadism. Tomorrow my husband and I are establishing with a new MD. Our kids gave up on this practice a few years ago. I am sincerely saddened to see this happen. They use to be top-notch.
4 I love this place!! The instructors for the classes are top notch, my kids love coming to roll and look forward to training now. They are learning so much and it's great having them excited to do the sport. The boot camps on Mondays and Wednesdays are a real workout, the trainer Joe is attentive and motivating, always making sure you know what your doing and and have proper form, you always leave feeling like you accomplished something, unlike some others I have been to. The only reason for not giving 5 stars is they do need to have a front desk person.
5 After being to another PT for my first knee surgery, I had Tim Soder's to compare. The first time I went there it was already a huge difference from my other PT. Private rooms so no one is in your business. Also very, very friendly. I was assigned with another therapist other than Tim but Tim made it a point to introduce himself unlike at the other PT, I went there for 6 months and never once did the owner introduce himself or ask how I was doing.  At Tim's, they push you to reach your goal and they don't care about the 1 hour time limit. If you need to do more exercises, they will stay there with you until you get it.   I def. recommend Tim Soder's to anyone looking for rehab.
5 Excellent service!! Very caring staff, and I would be happy to recommend them to anyone.  I have had plantar fascitis for the past 6 months and it has been very uncomfortable.  Craig Blankinship and his staff provided a plan and a goal so that I would be able to run comfortably again.  Thanks Craig and I appreciate your help!!
5 Love this studio! Nice atmosphere with polite staff. Most of the teachers are pretty funny as well. I used to go to true hot yoga in arrowhead ranch. Both are pretty similar except 3 things. Small parts of the flow are different (like anywhere). Summits is hotter and always busy. Obviously everyone loves this place and that's why they're busy. However, I don't like being right next to someone every time. You're touching people with your poses and maneuvering around them... Nothing summits can do about this though, just a result of their awesomeness.
5 Dr. Hudson is the man. I've been having back problems for quite sometime and he tells me to come on in and he'll check it out. Within a minute or so he found out what was wrong. He did some adjustments and had a few sessions and my back feels back to normal! i wasn't able to squat at all and even when i squeezed the pain was bad. Now the pain is gone and I am able to do my regular lifts again. He's quick, friendly, and gets the job done. I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a chiropractor.
5 After having constant chronic pain in my lower back and sciatic nerve issues for a year I was referred to physical therapy!  I tried ATI on Peak Dr and it was the worst experience I've ever had so my ortho referred me to JPT!  They are so incredible I can't stress this enough!   Having gone from the worst experience to the best experience in physical therapy, I can tell you I would never go any place else ever again!  The staff are all so friendly and professional and the technicians are very knowledgable, kind, compassionate and upbeat and they are all just amazing!  JPT is very lucky to have techs Amber and Korrine and Casey, the Therapist that I'm working with, is incredible!  After only 4 visits, I'm feeling around 70% better!  Casey knew the exact therapy for my issues and has changed my life 100% for the better!  The one on one attention really makes a difference!  The facility is extremely clean and sanitary and they all go the extra mile in every way!   I can't thank everyone at JPT enough for all the help and relief they have given me and for making me feel like I'm their only concern!  You would be very lucky to have Casey as your therapist as she's so amazing, knowledgable, caring, concerned and a true professional!!!
1 My experience echoes every single negative review on here. "Cure your Type 1 LADA Diabetes with potatoes and corn!" Seriously? every Doctor, Every dietitian has told me to avoid those two foods....All this based on incidents of Diabetes in the 19th century in Ireland. When I asked for the sources...I was also directed to his special VIP classes. They do indeed milk insurance companies. I seriously doubt a 1-minute EKG test run by the front desk staff (I asked if they were trained medically...they admitted they weren't) tells them anything about my cardiovascular health...but they did indeed bill my insurance for the 'test.'  Seriously, he's only milking insurance companies in some misguided attempt at opening his own "Miracle Cure All Center" something like Dr. Kellogg did back in the day. Awful. Awful. Awful.   You'd do better diagnosing yourself with WebMD or consulting a snake oil salesman.
5 I have been coming to this practice for years. It is a true family practice, however, they are progressive and they do everything in-house, they have their own x-rays, labs, chiropractor and physical therapy. I have used almost all of their services without any complaints. They are thorough and take the time to discuss all your needs. I personal use Dr. Becky, the PA, but I have also seen Bruce.
2 I have been to this urgent care a few times and was never impressed but my last visit was pretty bad. I went because my infant was sick. They had no changing table at all and seemed annoyed when I asked where I could change my baby. The front office processed other people's paperwork and brought them back before us - although we were there first. They also failed to return my DL and insurance card to me. They never called to let me know they had it - just waited until I realized they hadn't returned it. When I called them to ask about it the girl who answered just laughed like it was no big deal and happens all the time. All of this along with crazy wait times makes me never want to go back.
4 I've been registered here for about 9 years & always found staff, nurses and doctors to be very pleasant and willing to help in any way possible, my only gripes are non shows and getting through to the repeat prescription line.
5 Everything about this office was great! The lady working the front desk is so sweet and patient and thorough! And Dr Lopez is the best! He took his time to answer all my questions, I never felt rushed or unimportant. He literally sat down and listened and answered all my questions!  Truly a great experience from start to finish! I would recommend this office to anyone!
5 AZSDS is the best! They help our family with all our needs. Auden Leyva, LMT, ART, is outstanding. My daughter who is a D1 distance runner has gone to Auden for years, and it is the first place she stops when she comes home. My son, who play club soccer benefits from the sports massages as well. Mom even goes now. Auden is the best.... knows how to treat just about everything to get us back on the track, field, or even just the gym. Professional, caring,  & ever so knowledgeable, Auden is top notch!
5 To be honest, I was skeptical of a franchised chiropractic office, but trusted the reviews.  WOW.  I'm impressed!  Dr Judge is very competent, thorough, and can quickly and accurately assess issues.  The office system is ingenious and easy, and surroundings spa-like.  I love it!!!
5 Will add my "voice" to the other reviews here.  He deserves 5 stars.  Thanks to all who recommended him... you did not steer me wrong.
1 One of the worst massages I have ever had.  The therapist did not seem to know what he was doing and was incredibly rough with the treatment.  I asked for the session to be done early.  I would not recommend!
1 I had a couple cavities filled in at Wonderful Smiles. Both fillings resulted in bad shooting pain afterward when chewing or drinking anything at all hot. Over the next couple months I went back a few times to try and fix the pain, but all they did was file down more of the filling material without really looking at it to see if bite was even an issue. The pain never got better.  I eventually went to a new dentist and had the cavities redrilled and filled again, and the pain subsided completely within a couple weeks of the work being redone.   I asked the new dentist what he thought the problem might be, and he said he wasn't really sure but the craftsmanship didn't look particularly good and he could understand why it could have been painful.   In addition to the bad dental work (which is enough for a 1 star rating I guess), the scheduling was a mess and the dental hygienist was always fully booked 4+ weeks out.
1 I've been seeing Dr. Zenner for many years now for PTSD, Bi-Polar, agoraphobia, and anxiety disorders. I do not recommend going here whatsoever. Although he is relatively nice, he has a skewed view on how to keep an office and how to treat consumers, which we patients essentially are. For years I put up with incredibly long wait times that sometimes were 2 hours long. You sit there waiting in a smelly office with rude staff that don't seem to acknowledge you beyond charging you for your visit. Every time I went there was was told I owed them money for this or that, which I did not. That aggravated me to no end as well. When calling to either make an appointment or what-have-you, no one ever answered the phone and half the time you can't even leave a message. When you do, no one ever calls you back. All of these things created a great deal of stress for me. I would dread going to my appointments and become so stressed out over it that it caused my mental health to grow even worse.  Eventually I called him on these things during one of my appointments. He didn't seem to be too concerned about it. He said to me, "Well, gee.... I'm sorry. But hey, would you at least consider going somewhere else?"  Really? Telling a patent to go somewhere else for treatment?! I guess its no big deal to him as he works at one of the mental hospitals so is constantly getting new patients. Losing one here and there is nothing I guess. It made me feel as if my comfort and mental wellness was not important to him. Though he said he was sorry, he wasn't sorry enough to actually make changes. Please consider going elsewhere and save yourself the unneeded stress. Mental illness is bad enough without having your psychiatrist add to it.
4 Took myself cuz I didn't feel I was getting better.  Pleasant front desk staff, minimal paperwork (Yeah!!!), and not a long wait. I wish they had earlier hours but at least they don't close at 5:00 pm. Good experience as far as a visit to the doctors office could ever be.
1 I have noticed a significant change in the way I am treated in this office from when I started going approximately 7 years ago.  I recently had the final straw when I didn't get a prescription filled in time because I was not aware there was a time limit due to the nature of the prescription.  I called the office to see if they could re-write the prescription, explaining I was unaware that I had to fill it immediately and that if necessary I could return the original prescription to prove I wasn't trying to just get more pills.  In fact a bottle of 60 pills last me approximately 9 months!  I was told, sorry, policy, we can't do that, we tell everyone they need to get it filled right away.  I said, no, I assure you Allison Barto did not explain that to me when she handed me the prescription or I would have done so.  Basically the response I got was silence.  No offer to see if there was anything that could be done, nothing, nada, zip you are out of luck.  Just you need to come back and pay another co-payment to get it.   Prior to this I was left in the waiting area for almost an hour.  When I inquired as to when I would be seen as there had been multiple people who came in after me see the doctor AND leave, they said when did you get here?  Uh, an hour ago as is clearly written right here on your little log in sheet next to my printed name.  So finally I get to the back and received no apology from Dr. Allen which indicates to me that the staff didn't even care enough to let him know what had happened.  If any of my employees had made an error of this nature I would certainly expect them to let me know so that I could make a personal apology myself.   Recently I decided to make an appointment for an allergy test.  I was informed that once they confirmed that my insurance would cover they would call me to make an appointment.  I waited a week and hadn't heard a thing, well when I called back they said they were waiting for me to call them back?!  Seriously?  I inquired if they had even contacted my insurance and that was no, we need to do that and then we will call you.  They actually did follow through that time.    I also received a bill from them a few months back that I had paid while in the office.  After multiple calls I finally received someone who could help me.  Surprisingly the woman in the billing was really nice!  She apologized for the error and said she would correct the payment as soon as possible.  I actually do not have any qualms with Dr. Allen but the treatment I have received from the office staff is just deplorable.  I am in the process of searching for another doctor as I will not return to this practice.  If I could rate the office less than 1 star I would.  I just called to inquire about my medical records and the process to get them to a new doctor.  No inquiry about where or why I was going, I honestly didn't think she cared, so just proves to me that I am making the right decision to leave.
5 So I did a lot of reading about Bikram Yoga before attending my first class and it helped me select a studio that I felt comfortable with.  BYT is a wonderful studio.  Everyone is friendly and welcoming, especially for your first class.  They go out of their way to get to know you and you can tell they genuinely care.   I received so much help before, during and after class that I can't say enough about this studio.  Everyone is happy to be there.  I love that they have racks out front to sanitize your mat when you leave and the bathroom and showers are stocked with any toiletry you could need.  If you're considering Bikram yoga you owe it to yourself to try them out.
5 Customer Service Excellence. This clinic is professional beyond words. Extremely neat and tidy, I just came from my appointment with Sarah, who spent an hour+ examining me, explaining my issues, showing me different exercises, and providing me with numerous options for different kinds of shoes. At the end of the appointment, I even got a little goody bag! You are getting your money's worth and beyond at Academy Foot & Orthotic Clinics. Its so refreshing to finally go to a place that puts their customers first and goes above and beyond for them.
5 Dr. Lance Huff was great! The staff was amazing, got me in and four for dehydration, vomiting and a migraine in about 45 min. Highly recommend this crew!
5 Dr. Susan Sorosky is wonderful. Desert Spine & Sports Physicians deals with chronic pain issues at this practice & Dr. Sorosky's goal is to get to the root of the problem & fix the cause.  This is one of those situations where you actually feel respected & that the Dr. has listened to you during the visit.   I've had years on ongoing neck & upper back problems apparently because I was in 3 car crashes in a 6 month span when I was 18. What, like that's never happened to you. Other doctors just always wanted to put a band-aid on the problems by giving pain killers & muscle relaxers. This never solved the problem, & while everyone enjoys a little Vicodin now & then, it certainly did not fix the cause of the problem.  I also tried chiropractors & physical therapy. Both offered me temporary relief of the symptoms, but did not fix the underlying cause cause. After I got an MRI, I found out the cause was arthritis caused by whiplash years ago. The good news is that it can be treated.  If you have ongoing pain issues & need a solution, please do yourself a favor & see Dr. Susan Sorosky.  You're welcome. :)
3 I have mixed feelings about this doctor's office. The doctor I have been seeing is very "to the point" and doesn't take much time to form a relationship with the patient but she is also usually on time, so this is good in some ways. I don't like that they use older equipment for taking blood pressure, and I also don't like how the rooms don't have wifi or cell reception. On the positive side, it's convenient that they have the lab for bloodwork right onsite, and that it's first come first serve, and it seems like they have reasonable amounts of availability (I've never had to wait very long to get an appointment).
4 In my previous review I told how my brother stopped going to the Mesa practice due to rude treatment by Dr. Coury and the front desk staff.   Personally I have had great experiences at the Gilbert location with Dr. Andrews!  She has recommended tests for me on numerous occasions that resulted in me finding issues when they were first starting, therefore I was able to seek treatment before they became serious.    Yes it costs money for lab work but thankfully Dr. Andrews requested the tests for me and I got the needed treatments.  Believe me it would have cost a lot more money if she hadn't ordered the tests and I had not found the issues until I became really ill.    What I like the most is how the phlebotomist's they have are amazing professionals!   I have had blood drawn at many places and it's usually a terrible experience.  They try in one arm, then the other then a wrist, then the other.  Usually I'm poked 4 times.   I have had blood drawn numerous time at Coury Family Medicine in the Gilbert location and it has always been the easiest, most painless blood draws I have ever had!    Even when I go to Sonora quest in person for blood draw it's a terrible experience.  If you are terrified of blood draws from your arm, go to this office.  They will take care of you quickly and PAINLESSLY!!   I have never had a bad experience with them.
5 Holy Crap. These people are the most wonderful human beings of the week. I literally do not have anything bad to say about the magnificent body-workers of Triad Chiropractic. These people are saving my comfort, one vertebrae at a time.  I came in here today for my first visit to aid in the repair of my neck which was traumatized in my accident. I have never been a fan of Chiropractors, its always seemed like just a quick fix with no long term results, in my experience anyhow, but Triad is not just Chiropractic care, they are so much more. I went in, was given the undivided attention of Dr. Baca, who is an angel sent from above, for about an hour, where we went over everything from my family history to the events of my accident. From there he examined me and gave his prognosis, and then the treatments began. They do everything from Spinal adjustments to x-rays to Prolotherapy to Physical Therapy to ultrasounds. Its pretty much the one stop shop for auto injuries because not only do they do everything in their power to help you and make you feel better, but they also serve as a liaison between you and the insurance company you are dealing with. Its amazing. They even recommended me to the perfect accident injury lawyer and discussed with me all the possibilities with my case.  Its rare that I rave about anything to do with doctors.. I usually hate them all, but not here. I am actually wicked excited for my upcoming visits and finally feeling some relief.   Seriously, even if you were not in an accident.. go here. Whether its for Headaches, Carpal Tunnel, Tendinitis, Sciatica, Chronic neck/back pain, etc.. they will fix you!
5 Excellent staff and knowledgeable doctors. They do more than just give pills for pain. With a surgery center and physical therapy, they offer lots of options to help get past the pain. I highly recommend this place to anyone hurting...plus same day appointments are SUPER nice!
5 I didn't have a lot of faith in chiropractors before I walked into Dr. Staub's office. But I was blown away by him during my very first session. I've never seen a doctor before who has explained this much about every step of the process. He takes time in going over the science behind why I'm experiencing pain and what his approach will be to help me get better. He also explains things in a way that doesn't require a medical degree to understand.   I came in with a lot of pain and I didn't believe him when he said he will try to rid me of it within four weeks. Yet, here I am.. four weeks later and almost entirely pain-free! Dr. Staub has mad skills and is one of the most knowledgeable and considerate doctors I've ever come across. Adjustment sessions with him are incredibly quick and pain-free. I would highly recommend him if you are looking for a chiropractor who knows exactly what he's doing and will help you get better really fast. Five stars!
1 First thing they ask for is a credit card to have on file, like they don't trust you.  Nice feeling to have at your Dr. office.  Spent half a day getting annual physical including blood tests.  After asking 3 times if all tests are covered under my "free" annual physical and being told yes, I received bills from Warner, and the lab over $200.  They run tests that are not part of preventive so that falls under the deductible for insurance.  Also ran blood tests not related to me at all. Warner corrected those only after I examined each test and went over them with the lab.
5 The staff is great, they explain in great detail what therapy will be done and why. They perform an in depth analysis of your condition and need and formulate a plan to treat you. The environment is clean and nice. I've been twice now. The first appointment was the intake process which included some initial therapy. The second visit was for acupuncture and the guy who did mine was extremely knowledgeable on this therapy and explained in great detail what he was doing. This made me feel more relaxed and comfortable with the procedure. Looking forward to my future visits.
5 DeRosa Medical has been my PCP for over five years and everyone at this practice including Dr. DeRosa herself, is phenomenal!  She spends as much time with me as needed and I trust my health to her completely.  Besides regular check ups, I see her for Mira Vita her weight management program and it has changed my life!  Her program not only helps you lose weight fast but it teaches you exactly how to eat properly to keep the weight off.  I owe the talented Dr. DeRosa so much and I definitely recommend her practice to anyone wanting to take a step towards better health.
5 This place was awesome. Check in for a free script. The 3-4 times we have been there have all been great. Quick, clean and effective.   The older doc, can seem a bit rude but he was great with us.  The Doc who stiched my daughter's chin,did awesomes. Yesterdays nurse and doc were fast and friendly but did not waste our time.   The front desk was helpful, even when faced with checkin tasks she never say before.
1 We offer some in-house testing along with the convenience of full service laboratories located at each location.  BEWARE! This office sends them OUT! And not in you're network.  I am giving the  Billing office one star. If i could give None. I most certainly would. The billing office Only has a Bunch of RUDE! Nasty woman, that cant even admit when they make mistakes. Just Own it already. If I didn't have such a good Dr id tell them to stick it.  This in no way reflects on the good Dr Fazz he gets FIVE Stars.
1 I picked this place because it was open on Saturdays. I showed up early for my first appointment and a lady comes running out of the clinic to tell me they weren't open. Thank you but I knew that. I saw a male physician assistant and the guy just sat at his laptop and typed in everything I said. I could've made up an illness and he would've just typed it in. He did not examine me, did not address any of my concerns and did not question any of the problems I presented to him. He referred me for an XRay without first knowing my medical history and wrote me a handful of prescriptions without discussing any drug, drug or drug, food interactions or any side effects, symptoms, etc. When the results of the XRay came back, someone from the front desk called and told me I needed to have an MRI. I asked why and he read the XRay report verbatim to me over the phone. They did not schedule a follow up appointment with me to discuss the XRay results. In fact, the next time I saw the PA, he didn't even mention the XRay nor did he ask me about any of the medications he had prescribed. He discussed some lab results with me and wrote some more prescriptions. By my count, he wrote me seven prescriptions over two visits. When the results of my MRI came back, the office called me and said these exact words, "we wanted to call and let you know your MRI test results came back normal. ok, bye." No follow up appointment was scheduled to discuss the results. I requested my medical records directly from Simon Med, did my own research and found my own specialist. A few days ago, I called for a referral and they managed to bungle that as well. I shouldn't have wasted my time. I've got my medical records from them as well and I won't be returning for any more appointments at this office.
1 Worst PLACE EVER to send someone or get sent from a hospital you care about!!!!  You might as well tell the person if they have to go, good luck on ever getting out. Better yet, getting out alive. Probably better if you die then go here.  Place is such a joke. Seems like everybody that works there could give a sh** if you live or die. Everybody from the wanna be nursing staff to the top stupervisor. Nurses never attend to you, ignore, RUDE AS HELL, care a less. I think they send people that can't make it as a real nurse or someone who thinks they are a nurse they go here.  If you don't want to work there or wanna HELP people like YOU SIGNED UP FOR then quit. It's people / scumbags like that, that work in places like this one where people are scared to go because they get mistreated just like in this dump. You would probably get more help from a crackhead then this place! I wouldn't send my worst enemy here.  And that says ALOT. I wish this place would shut down but, wish in one hand, sh** in the other and see which one fills up!!  This place get a BIG GIGANTIC "F".  I will use the word FAILURE rather then what I really want to write because I know this wouldn't make it to press.  If they want to send you here.......RUN, AND RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN!!!  ( THIS PLACE "ALMOST" ) if not did, kill my mom.
5 Love my massages!! I have had just about every massage therapist at this location and I have NEVER been disappointed!! Amazing in every way!!! 5 STARS!
5 Beautiful clinic, with helpful and friendly staff. The best part was all the services I had done here; massage, Physio and Naturopathic Medicine were submitted to my insurance company! I didn't have to pay anything out of pocket! The staff are also so welcoming will definitely be back!
5 Dr Justine is fantastic! She is the sweetest and looks like a Hawaiian tropics model that can pack a good adjustment. I travel a lot and need regular adjustments and Dr Justine is legit! A must when you are in AZ!
5 Had to have cyst removed from my neck and they took care of it right in the office.   Amanda was kind and very precise to get it removed. She made sure to ask if I was okay along the way.   I have referred friends and family to his clinic and encourage you to go if you need a family practice to go to in Surprise.
5 The staff at JPT is exceptional. Every one of them from the PTs to the PTAs to the Techs are professional and on task. The atmosphere is totally congenial. All the staff make an effort to speak to and acknowledge the presence of the clients and continually encourage us to press through the exercises. However, in no way do they back off from doing the necessary therapy. They follow through with initial PT-client exercises then supervise the client in activities to strengthen the healing. Before and after my TKR, my PT is Kevin, my PTAs are Tammy and Adam, and my techs are Vince and Nate. You will not find more skillful PTs anywhere.  I highly recommend the Jackson group. They are the best!
5 Dr. Fabito is brilliant!  He's extremely bright, too.  Pain is  a complicated. The Physician must listen carefully to his/her patient.  HE DEFINITELY LISTENS.  He is not afraid to prescribe meds at the appropriate dose. He's dedicated to find the patient the right combination of meds.  Off course this takes time.  Definitely a winner!!  I have trigeminal neuralgia.  I walked into his office a mess and he has given me my life back!!!!
5 Very nice spa and they did an excellent job on my hot stone massage.  Highly recommend this place!
5 I came to see Doug after having an ACL surgery and I couldn't be more satisfied with the treatment,  the staff and the results.  I first came to Foothills just two days after my surgery, and was nervous and didn't know what to expect.  Doug did an excellent job of explaining my surgery to me and applying it to my timeline for recovery, and he and his staff made me feel comfortable and important the entire time. After a couple weeks I had high expectations in my physical therapy and I was very anxious to see results.  Everyone at Foothills was knowledgeable on my injury,  my progress, and my goals and they pushed me to a speedy recovery.    As painful as the process is to go through mentally and physically it's great to have a team like Foothills on your side to get through it.   I really enjoyed the experience and I'd like to thank Doug, Sam, Lesley, Rocky and the whole crew there for taking such good care of me!
5 Nick and his staff were very professional and caring. Nick helped me work through many episodes of dizzy spells and much pain after an auto accident.  They gave me easy exercises to follow at home and helped speed my recovery
5 Dr. Fihn is very professional and truly cares for his patients. Therefore, when I go to my medical appointments I have the confidence he will listen to my concerns and provide me with the best medical care. I am pleased to have Dr. Fihn as my primary care physician.
1 If you value your time, don't come to this Medical Office.   They are heavily booked for their benefit of production.  They obviously believe their patients have all day to sit and wait.  I don't!  I have a job and I certainly don't have 1.5 hours to sit and see the doctor for only ten minutes.
1 I was there today, one of my worst experience with the front staff, the manager was really rude and agresive with me today, their front staff are really unprofessional an doesn't know how to check insurance benefits or bill insurance, I was there on 1/9/17 and was charge a full visit as I dont have any insurance, so I paid and called my insurance company next day to have them call the office and let them know, I was correct, I have a $25 copay, so I go back today an been call by the "manager" it was my first time seen her, she said, they called my insurance and find out it had a glitch, but now shows my $25 copay, (when I had called  my insurance) I was expecting  a refund, well no she is your credit of $15 is going to be apply to your past due balance plus you still have a balance of $55 for reschedule some day appointments, I said I can't take care of that today, she said well we can't see you until you paid the balance and I said well most of them were rescheduled due to the fact that your office didn't have my results by appointment time ( I had been seen after those appointments with out been charge or let know about my charge or balance pending), and I ask to speak with Dr. Gonzalez and she refuse to ask her to call me or let me see her with out an appointment or even give her my message, so I decided to leave but then I remember I was there to get my results for my liver (was kind scare of) I turn around and decided to paid to been seen. (most of the time I have to wait more then 30min to been call back, so if i have to paid them for reschedule what about them been on time). The manager have her kids in there (really unprofessional and unsafe for the kids), one was a baby she was holding on her arms, so maybe she was under stress due to fact of running an office and taking care of her kids. (I don't think I deserve it). As per Dr. Maria Gonzalez I like her, I had been seen her since 2014, and referral most of my family  and friends there, but it's  time to look for a new Dr for me and family.
3 Doctor, Physician's Assistant, Nurse Practitioner and staff are good!  Main issue for me is just the office-- it's run down, definitely old, it wreaks of all sorts of weird, bad smells and the lighting in the office is always so dim and low.  After all, you should feel the sense of cleanliness and care coming into a doctor's office.
5 My left foot children's therapy is the best place my son has been since we move out here and since he started going he learned a lot and loves going there. Everyone that works in my left foot are sweet and caring. We love this place.
5 Today was my first time seeing Dr. Sullivan and I was very pleased. I have a long history of aches and pains that no one has seemed to be able to figure out. Dr. Sullivan took his time with me today and made me feel like he actually cared about getting to the bottom of it all! Very patient and definitely knows his stuff!
1 I would give no stars if I could....After seeing Molly Ann back in June of 2015, I was so put off by her lack of tack that I never went back. Flash forward to August 5 of 2016 I received an email stating that I owed $275 and if I don't pay it they would send me to collections. After trying to call Paige Fonk 3 times and dialing the 113 extension I was told to call only to be told it was  Michelle's vm. A week later and no call back. I called my insurance, after a 47 minute phone call and the agent searching all of our records  Norterra never even put a claim into them. Now they are after ME threatening to take me to collections. What a hot mess!! Be leery people...there is obviously more of a deficit then doctors who are tactless and try to push their pricey Medical Spa services on you. The entire practice was a terrible experience!  There was no "resolution" as Crystal refers to....I was forced to pay $75 out of pocket so that i was not sent to collections. Crystal is clearly new at NFP and trying to make a name for herself. Now she is stalking my Yelp review, even reporting it, trying to get it taken down. Perhaps she thinks if she keeps it up, I'll take it down....not so Crystal.The facts are still relevant, their customer service is terrible, as are their pushy practices. Their  horrible reviews speak for themselves.
5 Sandy has changed my live with her myofascial release technique! After migraine medication, chiropractic, massage, and anything I could do to feel good, I discovered Fyzical and Sandy.  Different than anything I have ever experienced.  Never go back to the other treatments.  Thank you Sandy & Fyzical!
1 I don't even know where to begin.. I'm newer to the area and was in need of a primary Dr. I spent a lot of time researching and was aware of the reviews prior to meeting Dr. Adams. She is very nice and really listens once you have her in the room. I have been here 3-4 times and waited no less than 2-2.5 hours. I understand she spends extra time with patients, but an office needs to plan accordingly. Twice after waiting two hours, they called a patient back that arrived after I did. I mentioned it to Dr. Adams and she said they're trying to get better. One time I had an appointment and they called the morning of to cancel because their computer system was down. Today I had an appointment that I made three weeks ago and they called a couple hours before to cancel because Dr. Adams had an emergency. I waited so long to get back in because I was told she was out of the office for two weeks. The staff is always nice, but completely unprofessional and inattentive. I can't even tell you how many times I've called and nobody even answered the phone, or I was left on hold and forgotten. Her medical assistant performed an ekg on me and told me I was in A-fib. She assured me she can spot this condition because she used to work at UCLA. Whatever that means. She had me scared to death. She said I needed to see a cardiologist immediately for a stress test and that it would be about $5000.00!! They gave me a referral and expected me to leave no questions asked! I can't believe the approach this woman took with me. I asked her to get Dr. Adams back in the room, it was like I was asking the world. She said Dr.Adams wouldn't be able to answer any questions I had because she isn't a cardiologist. C'mon! They finally got her back in the room and the Dr. apologized. She mentioned it was odd that she didn't pick up on it when listening to my heart. Well, maybe because it wasn't there! I went to a cardiologist that day and had a stress test. I AM NOT IN A-FIB and he agreed that the person should not have addressed the situation as she did. Oh, and the test cost $400.00. I can't tell you how many times I have had to call the office because they didn't electronically transfer my prescription correctly. The billing tried to bill me for two ekg tests on two separate dates, which was only done on one date. The bottom line is, this is no way to operate a business. I understand they overbook to a point to allow for no shows or cancellations, but there is serious room for improvement here. Dr. Adams needs help. If she's going to take off so much time, hire a Physician Assistant or Nurse Practitioner. The office shouldn't completely shut down. One can't expect patients to always run to urgent care. There are too many people that rely on regular medical assistance and this place is entirely unreliable, I'm sorry to say.
5 For the price, you can't beat Zen Massage.  I prefer firm, deep massages, and I've always been pleased with the level of pressure - even with a basic ($45 for 60 minutes) swedish massage (although bring on the neuro-muscular!).  With two available buildings (old Dilworth houses, essentially converted into massage room sweatshops) and a host of masseuses, I've always been able to get an appointment for when I want.  Each room is decorated in a relaxing and calm manner, and the East Blvd. noise melts away.  There's plenty of parking behind the two buildings.  Tip can now be left on a credit card (rather than cash), which is helpful when I (inevitably) forget to hit an ATM en route.
5 This place is a one stop shop for your basic medical needs.  I began seeing them for massage therapy for wellness.  I was given a free consult with the Chiropractor and found I had some underlying issues with my spine and neck alignment which were also found to be a cause of migraine headaches.  I was guided through therapy by a very attentive and caring staff of therapists.  They also recommended SPG headache treatments which have done wonders for my stress and concentration at work.  Check these guys out and see what they can do for you.
1 I had a terrible experience at this office and was misdiagnosed for over 4 months..  When I asked for a reduction for all the bills I received from them they said no so I am considering legal action.   Dr Holland or nurse practitioner Laura will never answer any questions on the phone.  Stay away!
1 I just moved to Arizona and I needed to see a doctor. I googled places with evening and weekend hours and probably should have read the yelp reviews prior to scheduling an appointment. But I didn't. I scheduled an appointment (at the W McDowell Road location) and ended up having to reschedule. Upon arrival, I waited over a half hour to be asked why I was being seen. I had to explain to no less than five people why I needed to be seen. Despite, filling out paper work explaining my reason for the visit before my appointment. This appointment was two weeks ago and I just now got my lab results (from the clinic - I received them a week ago via the app for the place I had my blood drawn). The clinic called me, I missed the call and had to call back twice to be told "everything is normal", without any verification that I was who I said I was. It's a HIPAA violation to not ask me for my DOB - I've worked in healthcare for 12 years, I know that you cannot disclose patient information without verifying that you are, in fact, speaking with the patient or somebody who the patient has designated as a point of contact. I also know how to read lab work, it was part of my job for years - my labs are not normal, unless you consider a low red blood cell count as normal. The NP I saw was rude & condescending - generally, I expect some level of courtesy or compassion from a medical provider. There was none to be had here. The "bedside manner" was absolutely terrible. I got to pay a copay for sub-par medical care and an additional charges for an off-site lab, when I was assured (rudely) by this clinic that I would not have to pay an additional copay. I should have just gone to urgent care, the copay would have been the same as the cost of this visit + the labwork. And I don't trust that these people know how to interpret lab results, given that my labs state one thing and according to them, "everything is normal". I asked for a copy of the lab results to be mailed to me so I can take them to a different physician, but I'm not holding my breath that I'll actually receive it. This is the least professional medical facility I've ever been to - I could be bleeding to death and I still wouldn't return. Don't waste your time or money here.
5 Jon has an amazing ability to help stretch your body pain free.  I've been able to work on my hips using Jon's assistance to free my body of pain.  I'm very grateful that I found him and would encourage anyone to use his services to help their bodies stretch and be free from pain as well.
5 Love this office! Everything is always on time. Dr. Middleton is very knowledgeable and takes the time to truly understand your needs. I definitely recommend visiting North Valley Family Medicine!!
1 This place has gone down since Sunrise purchased them. It was amazing when it was Urgent Care Extra.   The back staff and the PA on staff were incredibly nice and professional but the lady at the front desk was cold and rude.  Please know your benefits before you go in there especially if you have an HRA or HSA. They staff is not trained on how these work. I was told that I owed after my visit due to not meeting my deductible. Good thing I know my benefits. I pulled up my HRA account on my phone to show I still had money in it. When I asked if they could bill me if for some reason I would owe. The lady rudely stated she could call her supervisor. After she got off the phone she stated they could do a one time courtesy and bill me if I owe but next time I would have to pay since they don't have access to HRA accounts.   Please beware if you only have a copay as now that they are owned by a hospital they think you copay is irrelevant and everything is based on your deductible.
1 Absolutely worst experience ive ever had at a doctors office.  I had hurt my foot in the morning and was there hoping to get an xray or a professional opinion on what they thought might have happened.  They asked if it was my first time there, i said yes.  They asked if i had an appointment, i said no, i got a bit of a sigh from the office, but no big deal because i understand.  This IS an urgent care though... so id expect they know people walk in with "urgent" needs.l, without an appointment.  Now what happens next is what blew me away.  Mind you... i dont look very hispanic, but i come from an assyrian and guatemalan mix of parents.  I dont have an accent because i was born here and have never experienced not a bit of racism my entire life..  this however, was uncalled for.  The very american looking Doctor asked me and my son to go through the back door to talk privately, with some other personnel around.  He turned and told me, "We dont just give out narcotics out of this office."  Can you believe it?  How could you profile me as someone here for narcotics?! I told him i had hurt my foot and am only lookong for an xray to make sure it isnt broken.  Im a IT business analyst.  I have insurance.  Im dressed in a shirt and basketball shorts... jordans.  Nothing inexpensive.  Nothing that looked "trashy". But nothing extravagant either. Shows you where this world is coming to.  Im disgusted.  Nevertheless... i stayed a bit longer while that comment ate me alive from the inside out.  Looked at my son and said, lets get outta here, dads hungry.  Because i just didnt think my 8 year old son was ready to have me open up this unfortunate, still racist world we live in.
1 Pearla messed up my appointment and I was scheduled for the wrong day. Then I get a bill in the mail charging me $74.80 for a standard doctors visit with insurance. They OVERCHARGE or you could call it legal FRAUD to your insurance here. I found a better priced, efficient and intelligent doctors office whom only charges me $20 at Phillip's Family Practice 702-363-4000 5970 South Rainbow Road Suite 100 Las Vegas, NV 89118 Kaplan charges insurance start at $190.00  Phillips charges insurance start at $90.00
4 I had been a patient for many years and the only reason I left is because of the distance of the Dr. And home.  I  have been seen by another Dr.  And have not been treated as well as I did here.  I  am considering leaving my Dr.  To go back to Dr.  McCarty
2 (5/5/17) So this is a follow-up visit that had to be rescheduled because their office staff notified my wife's phone instead of my own. I'm currently wondering why I bothered since I have not been taken into the back even though my appointment time has come and gone. I wonder what excuse they'll use this time. 0945 still sitting in the waiting room...0949 finally I've made it back into an exam room. My blood pressure and pulse are taken and I am assured that the doctor will be with me in a few minutes, we'll see. 1002... Still no sign of the doctor. As the assistant said there's no telling how long exams will go on in the other rooms. But she did mention that Mondays and Fridays are the busiest days for appointments. Too bad that the front office couldn't relay that information to people wanting to make appointments. I also discovered why I am here at all, a blood pressure check... FML!
1 I am well into hour 3 in the waiting room for an appointment I had for 7 am. As they see everyone who had come in after me, I am getting more irate...this is ridiculous.
1 I wish I could give it 0 stars. The doctors are great and I really don't mind a student being in the office. Clean on the inside.   Unfortunately the staff is not so great. No return calls, orders for procedures sent incorrectly or not at all. Not a fan of the whole "we will call you about your test results if they're bad" they mail them to you if nothing is wrong. I'd much rather have someone call me to be honest. Back office needs to make a lot of changes because it's a mess.   I knew seeing the couple circling the parking lot smoking meth next door was a bad sign...
5 This practice is awesome all around. They have knowledgeable physical therapists who give their patients their full attention and time, they are extremely thorough and nice.  The PT techs are friendly and accommodating. It's always a pleasure to see Danny and Joel. Super thanks to our to Joel for dealing with me!! Lol.   Thanks guys!
4 Review Update  I usually write a gym review as my first review of the year. This year is no different.  Other Yelpers have complained about broken equipment and they're right.  This gym has a lot of broken machines and cardio equipment. Maybe it's cost.  This EOS does take their time to fix busted machines.  My advice...screw the machines and hit the free weights. This gym has everything that I need in order to get a good workout. I had over 500 sessions at this gym and honestly can say that I love this gym.    TIP:  Avoid this gym between 5 PM and 9 PM on the weekdays.  It's really packed.   2017 Yelp Review #1
5 Awesome little place definitely affordable and friendly and really convenient I love it and I really recommend it to anyone that's need something quick
1 My son was transferred there after serious auto accident.  The care was good but the administration was very unprofessional.  They ordered medical equipment for my son when he was able to go home and the medical equipment company delivered.  4 months later I get a letter from Home Again Medical equipment stating the insurance did not cover and I am responsible for the equipment that Healthsouth ordered without confirming if it was covered with insurance.  Very unprofessional and rude administration.  My son had insurance but Home Again was not part of their network.  Healthsouth could of easily confirmed this and went to an approved medical equip provider.   When I told them of this they refused to help and said it was my problem.  The true character of a company is when you have to deal with the little things after the fact.  Will not ever recommend this place to anyone.
1 It pains me to leave this review. But it needs to be done.  This practice came highly recommended by many parents I know. My baby is only six months old and is quite healthy and they messed up bad. I hate to think the outcome if she had serious issues.  My daughter has eczema. The cure? Buy more OTC cream! That's it. Not a review of allergens, no plan for treatment when creams weren't helping, no talk of a referral to a dermatologist. When cetaphil cream wasn't helping her raw, oozing skin we were told to try very expensive formula despite her having zero signs of food allergies other than this. I decided to take her to a Phoenix Children's Derm who was confused over their inability to treat a very common skin issue. The prescription creams should have been prescribed no problem and apparently the diet they had us put her on was pointless in our circumstances.  So we get another ped. We go to this appointment only to find out they MISSED GIVING HER VACCINATIONS. When the new office called GD, they informed that we did not take her to doc apnts. EXCUSE ME?! We have taken her to every doctors appointment recommended, have consented to all vaccines and followed through with ever (stupid) recommendation they made.   We were also lectured at every visit about how much we fed our baby. As in we fed her too much. My child is in the lower % for weight.  She grows fine and eats within the recommended amounts. I don't know why this was the focus of her apnts.  There are SO many other options for doctors out there. Our new doc is absolutely fantastic. We aren't the only family who has left this office due to negligent staff.
2 I showed up here 2 days ago at 2pm and was turned away stating they were no longer taking walk-ins. They are open till 7pm. So I made an appointment fir Thursday at 10:15am at 11:30 I was still waiting in the lobby. Just ridiculous why bother having people make appointments for a time just say show up in the morning and we will get you out sometime before 7pm. I would never go here again, the only reason I am here cause my work sent me here and they are paying for Physical to be cleared to work.
2 The front desk staff always makes you feel like you are a bother. I have been pushed to tears by a nurse and made feel totally uncomfortable before a Well Woman's exam. Dr Barry is very nice but I have expressed concern for the same issue to her twice, a year apart, and she does nothing about it. One time I saw a nurse practitioner and explained what was going on, she had no idea what I was talking about...I would have been better off consulting Dr Google.  A doctors office is supposed to make you feel comfortable to talk about your issues, but this office does the opposite of that and they don't even help to fix those issues. I do NOT recommend this office.
5 I have had back problems for 30+ years, I have been to several Chiropractors, had Spine blocking shots and even tried Therapeutic massage, well this last Friday 9/5/2014, I was healed!!! Matt the new Therapist hurt me good with deep tissue massage and got my knots out..., I have slept better than I have in years, thank you Matt can't wait to see you again, so the pain never returns.  Neil C.
3 Great doctors, crappy booking system. Their booking system requires that the patient has a deep understanding of their policy and procedure, certainly a pain in the butt for busy people. They have an online portion for, I guess, long term bookings and you need to call for day of appointments. The system is only available when they are open, so if you are busy or forgot to make an appointment before 11am, then you are SOL. But the doctors are great, you just have to figure out how to see one. Good luck!
1 As an urgent care, they suffice.  Cold, uncaring, atmosphere and long wait times can be expected when you can walk-in to your appointment same day and receive treatment.  As a primary care facility, just don't do it.  It doesn't matter how long you've been a patient, or what your circumstance may be, they simply do not care.  And when you do make an appt to see your preferred physician, you will not see them. You will see someone else, which has happened to me twice now.  Long time spent in the waiting room, 10 minutes tops spent with the doctor.  "I'll take your co pay and charge your insurance company, thank you very much.  Now leave" pretty much sums up the experience.  There are too many good primary care practices out there to settle.
5 My favorite chiropractor office. Went here regularly to see Dr Vogel before moving out if state due to my job. Highly recommended!
5 Brennan Bates is a talented doc with an impressive understanding of the human body.  He and his team provide a uniquely comprehensive approach to pain management which is appreciated with my aches and pains from being hunched over at work and repeated wrecks biking.  He keeps me moving and feeling healthy so i can do it all again tomorrow.
1 It is a sad day when a clinic has the top physiotherapists with tons of experience in sport med and the administration team just can't keep their shit together.  Probably time for new staff considering I graduated 10 years ago and still see the same people with the same poor attitudes.  Time to move on.  They screw up appointments and certainly do not put the patient first considering timeliness of appointments considerably affects injury recovery.  I get that schedules change but every week for the last month...seriously!!  The worst part is how they speak to patients like we are lucky to have the opportunity to have access to the clinic and pay $80 a session.  Don't waste your time and find help elsewhere.
1 I was sent to this location for occupational therapy and a follow up appointment.  I was originally seen twice at another location  on Paradise and had a good experience both  times, with minimal wait time and the two doctors I saw were excellent.  When I arrived at my appointment at this location they told me I would not be seen for therapy as it was not scheduled correctly but I was told I could still be seen for a follow up. Although I don't blame this office for scheduling me incorrectly, if I had known I was only being seen for follow up I would have went to the Paradise location as this office was nearly an hour drive for me. I waited over an hour before being called back just for my blood  pressure. I was then told there were several people ahead of me. I waited another 49 minutes then I rescheduled as I had already wasted three hours of my life for nothing.  Even then they could not schedule me for the correct appointments.   If you have a choice, don't waste your time here.
1 If I could rate zero stars I would! Brought my daughter here to be seen this morning. No one was in the waiting room and no one was at the front desk.   I stood at the front desk for 10 mins. No one ever came out to help us despite me loudly saying "hello". I could hear them in the back just chatting and laughing away.  I will never visit this place again and I will share my experience with others!
5 I can only speak for myself and my experiences.  I am the kind of person who deliberately calls the restaurant manager up from the back to let him/her know about exceptional service.  You know the internet is usually where people go to voice anger over bad service or poor quality,  because they are angry and upset.  I use the internet to call out the good and the bad.  Back in the spring of 2014 my wife and I moved from Michigan to our new home in Queen Creek.  One of the most stressful parts of relocation to a new community is finding proper health care.  This includes a solid general practitioner, specialists, Dentists, even Vets.   Finding the wrong  health care provider can end up becoming a financial and emotional mess for everyone.   My wife found out about Dr. Gupta through a friend.  A few months later when I realized it was time I started to use Dr. Gupta as well.  All I can say is that Dr. Gupta has been exceptional in every way possible.  She provides:  * An exceptional bedside manner (You really feels she cares about all of her patents) * She and her staff are organized.  She always gets back to me with a "Personal" phone call. * Her office follows up.  I was ill and her staff called me the day after to check on my condition. * No billing surprises! * Totally professional.  I have been in an industry where I have dealt with many physicians for over 30 years and Dr. Sunita Gupta is "The Real Deal". * My wife loves her.  (This should be point #1)  I can not say enough positive things about Dr. Gupta and the East Valley Family Practice.  Highly Recommended!
5 wunderbare, ruhige, sehr persönliche Sauna.  Eine Oase der Ruhe  wie der Name auch sagt.  Früher waren wir regelmäßig in den Schwabenquellen  die Zeit ist vorbei :-)
5 Dr. Sharma and Trails Family Medical are the absolute epitome of what primary care doctors & practices should be.  It's been many years since I've had the luxury of having a primary care doctor that I feel comfortable going to long-term -- but that's exactly what I was fortunate enough to find at Trails Family Medical -- and I'm thrilled to have that luxury again!!  Why? -Dr. Sharma really knows his stuff and obviously takes pride in that -The wait times are *unbelievably* short, like nonexistent -Dr. Sharma takes his time with you; you truly never feel rushed -The prices are *absurdly* fair, whether you're insured or not!  VERY fair!!  Bottom line:  You won't find this combo of expertise, thoroughness, timeliness, affordability, and sincere caring anywhere else -- period.  My only concern?  That every in the area finds out about Dr. Sharma and it becomes more difficult to get an appointment!  It's just that top-notch.
1 They are charging me 455 dollars for a bag of ice, not paying that because services were not rendered and I met my deductible from my health insurance... that is such bull... I told them things I could not take like certain medication and they still tried to give it to me... I was in network with my insurance but they can kiss my butt because they did not do anything and the doctor was so full of himself and did not listen to the patient... go to Dignity Health or Honor Health because they will work with the patient and not against... such a horrible hospital and when they put this bill to my collections on my credit score I will be fighting this because they did not do shit for me except give me a bag of ice and I could get ice from my freezer... such assholes from everything back of the house to front......
1 TERRIBLE!!!! The wait time is unsatisfactory and the staff is miserable. Perhaps the staff members are miserable because Dr Alfreda is scamming the elderly and hard working individuals out of their hard earned money.  I went to Dr Alfreda because I saw good reviews online and I was looking for a new primary care doctor. I waited 45 minutes to see Dr Alfreda and when I finally did meet him, he was in a rush and performed a routine physical evaluation. He looked in my ear and said I had a small amount of wax, he then proceeded to take it out of my ear which took about 10 seconds and is a job a q-tip could have easily performed. One month later I received a bill for $75.00 for this so-called procedure. What a total scam!!!
5 I've been working with Austin for just over a year now, and it has worked wonders for me.  I had been experiencing various aches and pains over the past few years, and had tried a number of therapies.  When Austin was highly recommended to me by some massage therapists, I decided to go for an initial free postural assessment.      Austin is knowledgeable, attentive, and quietly encouraging.  I love his focus on functional movement; it's all about enabling the body to move the way it was designed to move, and developing good habits for everyday activities.  Even after the first week of following my tailor-made program, I could feel an improvement in my body.   The progression in the programs he's created for me make a lot of sense, and it's reassuring to know that I'm developing strength and mobility that are so important in maintaining an active (pain-free!) life.  He's always accessible if I have any questions, and can adjust the scheduling to meet my changing needs. I've been telling all my friends about Austin, and am happy to spread the word to anyone who's looking for an excellent personal trainer!
1 I left this place feeling like I was leaving the twilight zone. The experience was just THAT bad. My sons first check up, he was seen 45 mins past his apt time. I thought OK, one bad time I will give them another chance. Two weeks later, he had a little bug so I made an apt for 1:20, saw the doctor at 3:00pm. The doctor was wonderful, very thorough and helpful and seemed to genuinely care what I was saying. Unfortunately, the Doctors here are surrounded by absolute bottom of the barrel help. It was truly mind numbing. I don't understand who is hiring there for the front desk, well I should say the side desk where you check out but PLEASE PLEASE RAISE THE BAR. I moved to Summerlin, so my children will have the best in care. While I am checking out, I DONT WANT TO SEE a mid twenties woman, with make up all under her eyes, like she hadn't even washed her face that morning, piercings, and arm tattoos. She was so rude, so classless, didn't say please or thank you ONCE. it was literally mind blowing. The woman sitting next to her was no better, I use the term woman loosely.  Please take the time and hire some professional, respectful, staff. It is such a shame that both of the wonderful doctors my son saw for his appointments are over shadowed by the ugly waiting room, long wait times (shameful), and low rent staff.
1 They either have a terribly system going or they're overbooking themselves. I've been at this office for over an hour and a half. 40 minutes of it has been sitting in the room waiting for my doctor to even come see me. I wouldn't recommend this place.
3 I went to NorTerra Family Medicine for my "Woman" appointments. I had gone to them for three-ish years. I'm not going to say the specific doctor's name, because I don't want to single her out. But, I was getting the breast exam done, when she was in them middle of it, and said "I'll be right back" and left me laying there, with no explanation. When she returned about three or five minutes later (Which I was straight in panic mode due to over thinking... why would she leave right in the middle of the exam). When she came back in to finish the exam, I said "Is something wrong?" and she says "No, I just had a lapse of memory for a second" and she literally left me laying there.... made me feel like.. did she feel something? Why would she just dip out of there like that?  My favorite lady was the lady who drew my blood for my annual blood work. She was always nice, and funny, and made a stressful situation seem like a breeze. The front desk girls efficient, but kind of snobby. Long wait times. If your appointment is at 2:00pm, expect to wait until 2:45pm to be seen.   Fast lab results, nice office, clean, straight and to the point.
5 Always have a great time here at pain stop. Friendly staff and quick treatment. Had my neck pain gone in just a few visits. I don't understand how Dr Pierce remember the name of all his patients. Anyways. Check it out.
1 What doctor has you come in and wait for 30 minutes in the back only to be told he won't see you.  This place. My husband needed to get blood work done but lost his paperwork. So he made an appontment to get the blood work paperwork and to go over some other symptoms he's been having with his boxer knuckle in his hand.  The doctor refused to see him untl he got his bloodwork done. So you take our co-payment, have us wait 30 min up front and than another 30 in the back for you to have your nurse come in and say this??? WTF!!? Horrible service!  My husband even gave them another chance cuz a friend referred us.  4 years ago I saw April about a knee problem.  Came into there and told her my problems. Said I was too young for my symptons to be anything major. Never ordered exrays or an MRI. Stopped seeing her after a few visits cuz felt like she wasn't listening.  Didn't address my problem again until recently cuz of bad doctors experience in this town and found a doctor that listened ordered xrays and MRI's. 6 weeks ago I had reconstruntion knee surgery showing osteoarthiris of a 50 year old....I'm 32.  I would have given zero stars if I could have
1 I hadn't been in the office for some time as I have been feeling great. I decided to make an appointment for a massage. They were able to get me in the very next day and I was satisfied with the price ($65 for 1 hour). The reason for the one star is that they now require payment in full prior to even being seen!! I'm a patient of record, always paid in full immediately after receiving any treatment and now they expect me to pay for services I have yet to receive? No thanks. I for sure will not be returning here or recommending them to anyone.
5 This place was by far the best experience I've ever had while visiting the doctors office. The outside was very well kept and tidy, and so was the inside. The staff was incredibly friendly and professional as well. In most places you don't get what you paid for and you end up spending more time waiting then with the actual doctor or nurses. This place however, I spent the majority of my time with the staff, and they made me feel so welcomed. The staff were so lively and smiling and laughing with everyone and that really is what made me write this review. The nurses and the doctor really spend their time helping me rather then trying to get in and get out. It was really a great experience and I'll definitely be coming here regularly because I found the experience just that great.
5 I went in for a massage a few months ago.   The therapist I saw was ok.  I don't think she had the skill level for my specific needs.  When I came out of session I heard two clients in the passing talking to each other about their therapist.  I asked who it was since all they talked about was how incredible he is.  I booked with Bruce right away and was lucky to get into see him.  He took the time to ask me questions regarding my specific issues.  I told him full body since I haven't run across any therapist who can address my specific needs.  During half way through the session I changed my mind and wanted him to just work on my back and he was ever so glad to accommodate me.  I am here to tell you I don't know what Bruce did, how he did it and his skill level was beyond anything I have ever experienced.  It was nothing short of a miracle.  I was actually able to move more than I have in years just after the first session.  He educated me, gave me things to do in-between sessions.  It is my personal opinion that he puts a lot of therapist to shame as I have had a lot of therapists throughout the past 10 years.  I continue to see him and after each session I can move a bit more and each session holds longer.   Bruce thank you so much for working your magic on me and you are truly gifted MJ
5 Went to a competitor and was very disappointed,  this place is perfect for weight loss and testosterone replacement.  I recommend them to you, I've been a client for 3 months and just purchased anther 3 months in advance
5 Great guy.  Takes time to explain things.  Office staff Ken and Myra were super nice and I was seen on time.  Don't like seeing doctors but it was a good experience.
5 Dr Davis is absolutely wonderful. He is professional yet personable. He listens and cares. I wish all my Drs were like him. The staff remember my name and call me by name. It really makes me feel welcome and appreciated. The massage therapist are a dream come true. I wish I could spend hours under their care. I actually look forward to my appointments.
5 I had, key word is had, Tennis Elbow. Brooke and her magic hands got rid of it in a few months. Now I'm back on my mountain bike enjoying the trails! Highly recommend this place!
5 Highly recommendable! I had a great experience at Orthopedic Sports Therapy working with Ryan.  He was very knowledgeable and responsive, helping me reach my goals.  The entire office staff and other PTs are very friendly and welcoming as well.  Beyond satisfactory experience!
5 I feel very blessed to have Dr. T in my life, she was a terrific doctor who listens and has helped me in my family many times. She cares about us beyond the doctor/patient realm and when we are hit with a crisis of some kind she will go out of her way to provide the care we need.  I cannot say enough positive things about Dr. T and her staff. They have helped me with some serious problems and I am much better for having them in my life.  If you are looking for a new doctor, this place does very well.  Thank you!
5 An out of body experience that was both divine and grounding.  Must make an appointment soon and give yourself something you richly deserve. PFP, Scottsdale, AZ.
5 The care I receive from Dr. Huang is top notch, I've gone so many times with pain here and there that was relieved in a visit or two.  Now I'm going for a old issue that I'm confident I will get help for.  The staff is always friendly, the booking is a breeze and service is always professional.  Great clinic!
3 Let me just start out by saying that they are getting 3 stars on the merit of poor communication involved.  What was supposed to be logically simple ended up being a complete nightmare.    I was involved in a not at fault accident in January when a Lexus of Richmond Hill driver crashed into my car while he was turning left.  Luckily, we were all okay but it left me with a whiplash injury that was diagnosed by my MD and physiotherapist/chiropractor at Apple Creek.    At the beginning of my visits, I was ill informed about the fact that my claims would not be submitted by them and that it would be this huge lump sum that I'd have to pay at the end.  In fact, I was never told this clearly at all.  My treatment lasted from January to April 2017 and at the end of those treatments, nobody mentioned anything and I was under the assumption that they were going to take care of the paperwork for me.    4 months later, in August, I received an e-mail telling me I needed to settle up a $972 invoice.  Naturally, I was shocked because this isn't chump change.  When I initially communicated through e-mail, I was given unclear solutions and answers as to what I should do so I finally phoned both my EHC and Apple Creek.    When I spoke to Apple Creek on the phone, they admitted to the fact that they were actually changing management/infrastructure and to make *their* lives easier, they were telling "certain clients to file their claims themselves".  They then told me that I could just file it online and no matter how many times I told them that I was on an individual plan and I *didn't* have an online portal, they just wouldn't listen.  I finally paid the $972.25 that I was "owing" to put an end to this huge long nightmare of dealing with this and ended up having a huge interest owing on my credit card because of that.  Once that was said and done, everything else happened at a reasonable time including reimbursement by both them and my EHC.    In terms of therapists there, I've had a chiropractor and two different massage therapists.  Both massage therapists were good although Jeanette really was excellent.  Livia was my chiropractor and she was also professional and friendly.    Overall, on the basis of just clinical practice alone, I can see why they get good reviews but this whole insurance thing has just been a series of poor communications that made my life very difficult; and this is the sole reason why I am so upset about this situation.  Had I been informed about this from the VERY beginning of my treatments, it would given me a clearer idea of whether or not I was going to go forth with treatments in this practice because at the end of the day, I'm very focused on efficiency and ease of services for the client.  So finally, 10 months after my accident, this has all been resolved but unfortunately, I will not be returning here for my needs and will seek care elsewhere should the need arise again.
5 A caring practice! All places should be as good as Davidson Family Medicine.
5 I highly recommend Mercado Chiropractic needs.   Dr. Marc's skills, knowledge, compassion and the fact that he pays attention to details are impeccable.  All of my issues are being addressed which is quite a challenge.   A pleasant surprise is he is also covered under my United health care plan.
5 Dr. Nemanic is outstanding, I got to the point with headaches where I was willing to try anything before going and getting MRI's, CAT scans, and thousands of dollars in medical procedures on my brain that were possibly unwarranted.  I saw him twice in the last year the first time I was having at the peak of my serious headaches and pain from a pinched nerve in my neck. He assessed me, adjusted me, and gave me some great consultation on how to correctly sleep (on my side or back and NOT my stomach) he then also gave me some extremely sound guidance on stress management. I really appreciated this because that's what professional doctors are supposed to do. Usually if you're sick or stressed out it's been my experience they want to throw medication at you, or do a 5 minute sweep of your body, tell you you're fine, and please leave. I utilized the advice he gave me for my neck on proper stretches, and then for stress management to get back in the gym and start exercising more. I haven't had anymore headaches since the day he adjusted me and I have had thriving results with the stress management and getting back in the gym, the 2nd visit was just to go back and check in again, make sure my neck was still in good shape and that was that! Thanks again Dr. Nemanic, truly appreciate it!
5 Not sure what this lady Barbara is talking about but I been in this practice for 3 months and had the most pleasant experience , the whole staff is very welcoming and carring , very friendly always smile and crack jokes and more importantly they focus on your problem areas when you in pain ! I recommend this practice to everyone 100%
5 I've been seeing Dr. Sullivan for the past 2 years and couldn't be happier.  He's a great doctor and person and I definitely recommend him to anyone searching for a family doctor in the area.
4 We saw Dr.Komathy Jayashankar about a year ago as walk-in patients and were able to get on her patient list. She is a compassionate and dedicated doctor; on one occasion she immediately noticed and calmly, yet subtly, reassured a nervous family member. I like the fact that she isn't quick to prescribe pills and I believe that the office is busy because they are trying to see as many patients as possible. Of course to some it would look like profit is the motive for the quick in and out, but I like to believe that the doctors have the patients' best interests at heart and are doing their best to meet the high demand. A male doctor that I saw once a few months ago (I didn't get his name, there is very little small talk) was also very gentle and knowledgeable. The last time I needed an appointment I was able to get in at my requested time and date and I only waited maybe 10 minutes past my appointment time for the doctor to see me.
5 Dr Kuhn is the most amazing chiropractor ! He takes the time to explain things to you, he does not make false promises and he gets to the root of the problem.   He is the real deal! He does not want to keep seeing you week after week,three times a week -he wants to get you fixed and send you on your way-that's his whole goal in his practice.   My whole family uses him and I have recommended him to many of my friends and neighbors who are also extremely happy with the results they have seen.  Trust me - you will not want to go to any other chiropractor after you have seen Dr Kuhn!!
5 I suffer from horrible, head splitting, pulse pounding migraines.  I am also a patient of Dr. Herrera at Complete Care Medicine *despite* the fact that I live in Central Phoenix...many, many miles away.  He has a wonderful bedside manner and he really listens to your concerns.  Because a low pressure system is moving across Arizona today (and low barometric pressure seems to be a trigger for my migraines) I could feel one start to pulse deep in my brain.  Attempting to cut it off at the pass, I quickly grabbed for the prescription strength migraine pain pills I always carry in my purse only to realize, much to my horror, that I was down to just one pill and that it was lunch time on a Friday and Dr. Herrera's office closes early on Fridays!  In desperation I called my pharmacy and asked if the pharmacy could initiate a refill request with the doctor, but they explained that because these pills are a controlled substance that they must be refilled by a written prescription, and can't be refilled electronically.    I quickly called Dr. Herrera's office and spoke to the appointment scheduler who was very sweet.  I explained my predicament to her and she made an appointment for me with Dr. Herrera for his soonest available opening and she also volunteered to go ask him if he would refill my migraine pain prescription in the meantime.  She told me she'd ask and call me right back if she was able to get him to approve it, but she warned me that because they closed early today the soonest I would be able to pick it up would probably be on Monday.  Well, not only did she keep her word and call me right back regarding the status of an emergency refill of my medicine, but she also told me that despite the fact that their office was going to close in 7 minutes, if I could make it over there within the next half an hour Dr. Herrera would stay behind after they closed just to wait for me so I could pick up my refill paperwork from him.  I drove over there as fast as my pounding head would allow me and made it in time to get my refill script from Dr. Herrera!    I am eternally grateful to both of them for going the extra mile for me today, migraines suck and clearly they understand that and sympathize. Thank you guys!
5 Dr. Sullivan is by far the best doctor I've ever seen, and unfortunately, I've seen a lot of doctors. My entire family sees him and we all love him. He's very down-to-earth and real. His patients aren't just another appointment to him. He takes the time to sit and listen to all of his patients and answers questions, without making them feel dumb for asking.  He's very considerate and really wants to provide the best care possible for all of his patients.  He also gets that his patients aren't made of money and does everything he can to try and save us money, while still providing the best care possible.    His office staff is also great. They always remember my name and go above and beyond to make sure any questions are answered and to take care of things for me quickly.   I would absolutely recommend Dr. Sullivan to anyone looking for a new family doctor!
5 I decided to go to performance therapy after having a knee injury, which potentially could have ended my career. Danny and his staff are outstanding. After a few sessions, I was back to my normal exercise routine. I can honestly say they saved my career!
5 My family has been a part of the University Sports Medicine for many years. All the Doctor's, PA's and staff have always been helpful no matter what medical issues we have gone through. They listen to our needs and combine their expertise to deliver the best medical care.
5 I have been going to Dr. Gage for a little less then a year after a family member recommended him. I first started taking my 2 y.o. daughter when she was having issues digesting food and she also had a cold. I will never take my daughter to the kiddie dr. ever again anytime she gets a cold we just pop in to Dr. Gage and she is almost always better next day!  He has also done wonders for my husband and myself! With not only back issues but over all better health and immunity. Chiropractic care isn't only for people who have back problems its really for everyone!  The staff are so friendly and treat you like family. If you are looking for a great chiropractor i highly recommend Dr. Gage @ Gage Chiropractic!!!
5 I have been to several different chiropractors and Dr. Darr stands far above the rest. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. They all seem to care about your visit and that starts from the top. Dr. Darr not only has improved my overall health and well being, but spends the time to explain the how and why. The value in this helped me develop food habits and understand that chiropractic is more than just an adjustment. I recommend this group for anyone, but especially as a nice alternative to the little things that pain the body. They keep me feeling great.
1 $225.00 for a strep test and a PA to look at me for 3 minutes. The unproffesional young men running the front counter was very dissapointing too. I've been coming here for about six years and will never return. This place can kiss my...
1 Awful staff!  Never returned numerous phone calls to just change a prescription!  I actually had to call the nurse of another doctor in the office TWICE just to get what I needed.
1 Received a phone call from their office wanting to give a free consultation if I were to donate canned goods to their food drive.  I was hesitant at first but they called many times and decided to give it a try.  On my appointment day, which was today, I received 3 phone calls making sure I was still coming in.  My appointment was at 2pm.  I arrived at 140pm just in case to fill out paperwork.  They did not tell me the office was closed from 12-2pm.  2pm comes around and I go in and check in and fill out paperwork.  I was told at 220 pm that it would be a couple more minutes.  At 245pm and after several people were let in before me that came later than me, I asked the lady for my paperwork and left.  I wasted 2 hours for nothing.  I had a list of referrals for them because some of my friends thought it sounded good.  That list is in the trash now.  I will not refer anyone to this business.
1 This place is horrible! Not an urgent care at all. The name needs to be changed to my dr 3+ hours later. I went in there waited for over 2 hours to see of my daughter broke her hand after a fall at school. The front desk person was even surprised I was not seen yet. Then I was told by another person that appointments take priority. I said that is ridiculous-how was I to know my daughter was going to fall and get hurt.  If you are in Laveen go to the Dignity Health on 51st-went there after this place and got thru in 1 hour!
4 Great, convenient location in North Phoenix. The staff are friendly and professional. Samantha, the nurse that comes in before the doctor was fun yet professional. Dr. Katy Kirk was a good listener, knowledgeable, relateable, and showed compassion and empathy for the myriad of ailments I came in for. I really feel like she heard me and took appropriate actions with testing that I did NOT come in for, but that is necessary to get the full picture of my health status. I was very satisfied with my visit.   The only reason I did not give this practice 5 stars is because I was trying to adhere to the model of choosing ONE PCP who I could create a rapport and subsequently, history with. However, now that I think it about it, that probably doesn't much matter since all a new doc has to do is read a chart. But then who do I say is my doc when other docs ask who is my Primary Care Physician? If I belong to no one then am I always a "new patient", right? Irrational fear of change, people. I do like that I could get in today (if you call early enough) or the next day. I mean who doesn't want their sh*t expedited?  Especially if you legit called in sick to work today.   Bottom line? I highly recommend giving this healthcare model a try. I think for those who "hate it", it's because they don't like change at all.
1 My first experience here was not bad (personally speaking). Someone was bleeding in the packed waiting room. It was busy; none of the medical professionals stopped to ask the bleeding man if he was ok. And it was apparent that he was in pain because from time to time you heard him groaning. My second time here (1992), my sister, older brother and I were in a car accident; my sister & I were rushed to the hospital in an ambulance, but we were left strapped in the gurneys for a few hours before getting any attention. Ridiculous. I should've known, since witnessing the bleeding man in the waiting room incident, that we would be ingored as well.  The expansion of the hospital brought on a maze-like feeling, as you were trying to get from one place to another, but finding that it's only confusing the hell out of you. You can walk and walk and walk. It's kinda like the street layout of Las Vegas- they didn't think that the city was going to get bigger and that's why the streets end and reconnect whereever they want (Harmon goes through UNLV, Spring Mountain turns into Sands that turns into Twain, etc.).  Fast forward to the sexual assaults that some patients fell victim to, the bankruptcy, the CEO getting charged with embezzlement- it's no wonder why this is a hospital to avoid. Unfortunately this is The hospital for trauma.
5 Love going to Backfit and Dr. Colby is great.  All the staff is friendly. I have been going for a year for weekly adjustments.
1 So maybe I was spoiled by my old dr's.  they called in refills the same day, they returned calls the same day and they could manage to schedule appointments without mucking them up.     Mountain view is different.   I am in the midst of a gout attack and they cannot call anything in because they haven't seen me recently.  I was in there 25 days ago.  Two days ago I called ahead of time for my refill of meds. And they didn't call me back so I called yesterday and didn't hear anything.   Called this morning didn't hear back.  I called back at 4 and never got a response.  Finally went in to the office on the way home and the very nice office manager Trisha helped me.  But the dr wouldn't call in the meds that I needed for my gout and they didn't realize that I needed my monthly meds called in.   These people are clowns.  Very upset.   I will never go back there.
5 My daughter had an ear ache, I didn't want to wait to schedule an appointment on monday. Luckily I was able to find this place open. The staff here is very friendly and caring.
1 After visiting Doctor Dahlia Wachs office and not receiving an itemized bill for payment I contacted the office several times requesting the bill be mailed to me so I could pay my portion of the owed amount. They indicated several times I could pick it up in office. After I explained several times that I was not in town and would need it mailed to me they failed to do so. I now received a phone call from a collection agency stating that I have a balance of $121.00 and an added on fee and interest making my bill now $173.00. I feel this is just wrong considering I called several times requesting my amount and itemized bill and the office staff for Dahlia Wachs failed to send them to me. Ive been calling the office requesting to speak with the billing department and they keep telling me they are unavailable. The office of Dr. Dahlia Wachs is a complete disaster and possibly why no one there can do there job. I can't believe this is how she lets people in her office run her business. I wonder how many other people have been in this same situation with them. I even called twice today to try and get this resolved and the front office lady hung up on me. I will not be returning and would never recommend going here.
5 Edwin is excellent. He's honest, competent, thorough. I have taken both of my kids to Edwin for multiple issues and he's helped every time. He's even told us when therapy was not needed.
5 I can't speak for the rest of the doctors but Dr Nicolas Snyder has been one of the most attentive doctors I have ever had.  I have seen him many times and he is now my regular primary care doctor.  His excellent bedside manner and care for his patients is utterly apparent and gives me peace of mind that he is listening and cares about helping me be the healthiest I can be.  Easy to talk to and definitely My Dr Nows best doctor now that Dr Zamani no longer sees patients.
5 I really love this place. I've gotten so much help for my kids here. The staff is so friendly and efficient. I never have a problem getting an appointment that fits my schedule. I recommend this place to everyone.
5 A great doctor who follows an integrative approach.  Which means blending western medicine and alternative remedies.  You no longer have to feel like you can only live in one world or the other, or risk some adverse reaction because you see a western medicine doctor for some of your treatment and your naturopath for overall good health.  So you get a doctor who focuses on the whole you and figuring out the problem instead of pushing meds and hoping.    Oh, and she appreciates that her patients actually know their own bodies!  So you get to be a part of your own care plan, which leads to better outcomes.  That, and well, she's just cool!  :-)
1 If the Core Institute accepts appointments to see and physician but instead gives you a PA (that they call a doctor), go elsewhere. The difference in training is monumental. This is a practice that should stop immediately.
5 I am so glad and thankful that my Orthopedic Surgeon referred me to Synergy Physical Therapy after my ACL reconstruction!   The facility is very clean, nice and modern.  Vincent, the Owner, is very knowledgeable and really educates his patients. He really knows what he is doing and I have watched him work with patients of all ages. Vincent is never in a hurry, answers all of your questions and always has a smile on his face.  His Staff is very friendly and professional and makes you feel like you are part of their Synergy Family from the minute you walk through their doors.  The office runs on time, which to me is respecting my time!  The treatment and exercises are always different and are never the same, old same old, which really makes it fun every time I go. It's challenging and it will make you sore but sore has never felt so good!  Synergy Physical Therapy truly is the place for me and YOU! :) If you want to get better that is and are willing to work hard!
5 Love the staff! I feel like a new person after leaving! Not a huge fan of being adjusted but the doctor put me at ease and I'm happy I agreed.
1 go the extra distance to avoid this place.  My husband and 5yr old sat in the lobby for over 45mins, and were the only people there.  Finally I called, asked if they were busy, of course she replied no. After firmly informing her how ludicrous it was for them to be waiting that long, were they FINALLY seen within 5mins. Seriously! I've been in and out of Diginity Health's ER in less time than that, absolute bullshit! I'm a very understanding person, this is more than one person being lazy. It's multiple people not caring! This is the closest location to my house, never again will we waste our time and money.
2 Do not go to this doctor they are unprepared and almost useless.  I got a sledding injury January 7th, slammed my lower back/spine into a tree and could barely walk/stand for a couple weeks. So I called Dr. Adaoag's office, who is supposed to be my primary "Care" doctor, they said they can't get me in for 8 days, I asked for an earlier appt because I can't move/walk and the ONLY reason I got an appt 2-3 days later was because I told the nice new nurse I need an appt asap just for X rays and how several months earlier they did the same thing and made me wait weeks and got worse before going to therapy months later. So I go in told him what happened, he barely poked my spine for 4 seconds and ask if I'm tingly I said no, asked what else is wrong. I mentioned my throat and nose being irritated/stuffy for a few weeks, and then he asked "Do you smoke?" I said "I stopped when cough came" he said "Well quit, that's problem!". That's ignorant/obvious, he didn't even listen to chest with stethoscope or anything, how does he know it's not something serious? So they call 4 days later after x-ray schedule, me for 9 days later, now I get a call and am told they're cancelling, doc can't see me and I have to wait another 4 days. Well at this point I'm almost better and it's pointless but I need to see the results, I asked if I can just pick them up myself they said they don't even have the x-rays. So what am I waiting for? So I have to go to radiologist and get x-rays myself. FYI, I reinjured my back again at work waiting to hear what the problem is with my current injury, big surprise!     This is about the 3-4th time it's happened. The 1st time I mentioned earlier, I had dislocated my knee, asked for soonest appt, they made me wait 10 days in agonizing pain before seeing him, sent for x-rays & follow up took 4 weeks, then 4 more weeks for MRI & follow up, and 2+ months for the results, after 4-5 reinjury's, physical therapy starts, which should have been done within 2 weeks. Another time I was working with a bad virus, called, again made me wait 9-10 days coughing and barely able to breathe, and finally went in to get antibiotics. I've asked before, "Why is scheduling is so horrible, the soonest I've ever seen the doctor is 5 days?" I was told "We double book appts every 30 min and there's only 1 doc" Well ill prepared, have no x ray machines, no blood taking equipment, no useful equipment at all, except to check blood pressure, EVERY issue I've had I have to be referred somewhere else, which I was ok with until now.  After the 3rd major strike of carelessness, I see the pattern now, it's all about the money and I want a doctor that cares about his patients not squeezing as many people in for a day and cashing out. So I'm going back to my old doctor 15 miles away because at least they accept walk in's, and I can get an appt, x rays/MRIs, results and everything I need in less than a week.   Now for the good, only reason I'll give this office 2 stars is if you need an RX, Doc note or referral to a specialist go here, I have seen some other great doctors that I've been referred to by Dr. Adaoag, which is why I been going here for a few years. Otherwise, if you have a serious Illness or injury worse than a bruise or cold I wouldn't suggest using this doctor.  I CANNOT work with bad injuries, risk getting fired for calling in with no doc note, and having to wait weeks and weeks for something that can be handled in a week or less. So I am forced to find my old doctor if possible. I just have to warn someone &  I hope this helps at least 1 person.
5 Eric was my therapist.  He was knowledgeable, through, and informative.  He explained everything - why I had to perform certain exercises, what the expected and possible outcomes were, and progress and changes along the way.  Unfortunately for me, the end result was not good.  But that was not because of Eric.  In fact, the bad outcome I suffered was a possible outcome discussed by Eric.  I felt like he (and I) gave a best shot and I very much appreciated his efforts.  He was also very patient but firm.  I though those were great qualities in a physical therapist.
5 I've lived in this area for about 3 years, and have gone to this urgent care 3 or 4 times. It has always been a really great experience! The waiting room has a nicer feel than most urgent care offices that I've been to, the front desk staff is always friendly and helpful, I've always been taken care of surprisingly FAST, and I've liked every healthcare provider that I've seen. Every time I've gone, it's been for strep. They always listen to me, quickly do a strep test, get me my prescriptions (saves me a trip to the pharmacy!!), and on my way. My husband went once for an upper respiratory issue, and once for an ear issue. He's had good experiences as well, although he said he had to wait for a while on his most recent visit. I'm sure we'll be back!
1 Absolutely horrible on scheduling and time frame ... waited over an hour to be seen when I asked for an estimated time she wouldn't give one saying there is 2 ppl in front of me serious waste of time ... extremely irritated... won't be back place is trash
5 I got into a car accident not to long ago and all the staff is really nice they really care about the care of you.. Doctor day is awesome and he knows what he is doing I love it.. They get the job done..
5 Awesome!!! I am terrified to be adjusted and he was very professional and walked me through everything before and during the procedure. I will be back for sure!
4 This is a great little walk-in clinic on Jean-Talon. Since after 6 years on a wait-list, neither my husband nor I have been able to obtain a family doctor, we find ourselves coming to this walk-in clinic whenever we are so ill that we need some medical guidance. As another reviewer mentioned, you definitely need to come early if you are hoping for a walk-in appointment. And if it is during the time of the ''cold and flu season'' believe me you can never come early enough. Most recently when I was ill with the flu, I tried to get a walk-in appointment just 6 minutes after the clinic had opened and all of the walk-in appointments had already filled up. However, speaking from experience, this is incredibly rare during the summer months. Also, this clinic is thankfully open 7 days a week! Hurrah! What a uncommon deviation from most of the walk-in clinics in Montreal and an absolutely wonderful boon for the neighborhood!   I have been coming to this clinic since it opened nearly 5 years ago and I have never seen the same doctor more than once; which in and of itself is not a terrible problem. However, having so many doctors on staff with so many varying backgrounds and approaches to treatment means that it is impossible to for anyone to rate the quality of the treatment given and consequently, my review (and keep in mind, all Yelp reviews) is for the convenience of a walk-in clinic which is open 7 days a week. The reason for my 4-star rating is that there are many, many, many doctors working at this clinic on a somewhat irregular schedule where they work on an aberrant and inconsistent rotation; I can promise you, you will never ever see the same doctor twice. Unfortunately, we have found over time that not all of the doctors on staff give welcomed advice nor prescribe effective treatment nor appropriate prescriptions. Case in point, when I was 7 months pregnant, I came here with severe flu symptoms. The doctor suggested cough syrup. Knowing that cough syrups are not permissible when pregnant, I asked her if it was OK for me to take cough syrup since I was in my third trimester of pregnancy and she asked me, ''oh, are you pregnant?'' ''Well, ehm, yes'' I said, ''the triage nurse wrote it in my file'' (it fact, as a rather healthy woman it was the ONLY thing written in my file)! Needless to say, I was NOT impressed. On the bright side, I have never seen her again. Also, more recently, my daughter had pneumonia and (another) doctor gave her two prescriptions for asthma(!?!?!?). Even the pharmacist was surprised and she asked me why he had prescribed her asthma medication and not something for her pneumonia. Incidentally my father is a M.D. in practice in the USA and I called him to asked about the doctor's prescribed treatment for my daughter and my father's reaction was of surprise and disbelief. He capped off his commentary with, ''UGH, Canadian healthcare.'' Regardless of my father's opinion, after several days, the treatment was not surprisingly completely useless and my daughter continued to get worse. But unfortunately, it was not possible to question the doctor's approach nor his recommendation. The only thing we could hope for was to return to the clinic and try our luck with another physician.
3 I would say this clinic is better than most, but I still ended up waiting a long time (more than 5 hours altogether).  I went in just before 8am (they open at 7am). The receptionist gave me a number. She didn't actually explain it to me at first, but you can call the number on the ticket and it will text you when your number is getting close. (I dont know why every clinic doesnt do this.) It cost $3 for this service but it seemed well worth it. I went to a coffee shop nearby to kill time. At about 10:35 I got a notice that they were a few people away so I came in. About 20 minutes later I saw the nurse. She told me to go back out and wait. At 1pm (an hour later), I was still waiting to see the doctor. So it's a good system in theory, but you should still be prepared to wait.   My suggestion is to wait until your number is very close. You don't want to miss your slot, but the nurse called people a few times if they weren't there so it seems like not a big deal. An even better idea is to show up at 7am or even before so you're the first one to be seen. It seems like the only way to save burning your whole day. Don't bother trying after 11, they will be full.  It makes me sad to say it, but this was still one of the better experiences I've had at a walk in clinic in Montreal. The receptists were nice. People were mostly fine about speaking English (it helps to try in French a little if you can). Would have been 5 stars if they hadn't called me in way too early.
5 I loved this place. I went for a massage by Ray and the staff were great. The location is close and not in a crowded area. The massage was amazing (I went twice I liked it so much) I was here for the festival performing dance 25 days in a row without a day off and my body was in terrrible knots and pain, but this place is so worth it, prices are just the same as anywhere else. WONDERFUL
5 Angelo and his staff really invest in the health and welfare of their customers.  Their equipment is state of the art and they have an extensive array of systems and products meant to help athletes heal and work towards that next level.  Whether recovering from a lingering ache or preparing for the Ouray 100 high-altitude race, Illumina has got you covered!
5 What I like about Step Up is that the staff is highly qualified, professional and efficient. I have never had to wait for more than 5 mins for any appointment. They have direct billing which is fantastic. The location is convenient. Dr. Jacky Leung is great. He walked me through his process and every step of the treatment which was great since this was my first chiro treatment. He is more focused on fixing the root cause of the issue than a temporary band aid solution. I have observed a huge difference in just one session. I would highly recommend Step Up Massage & Rehab and Dr. Jacky Leung
5 Came in for 6 weeks of PT for iliotibial band syndrome as result of overtraining for triathlons. Worked primarily with Drew who was great, very knowledgable on sport related injuries and therapy options, gave solid advice and got me back to running. The facility was new and up to date. Drew and his assistants were always friendly, welcoming and great to chat with. Getting appointments was easy and they're open late.
5 I generally hate going to the doctor's office, but Dr. Ortega is a great family doctor! She is exceptionally friendly and always hopeful; she makes each visit comfortable.  Like most offices, this place is always busy, so get there early to fill out paperwork and anything else they need before you see the doctor.  It's nice to know there's a doctor out there who genuinely cares about you and wants to help you in every way possible.
4 On business in Vegas from out of town and developed bad sore throat. Saw folks at this location and they were wonderful. I was in and out, with exam, shot, and prescriptions in about an hour. And I feel so much better today! Thank you!
5 I highly recommend Select Physical Therapy.  I came here to rehab from my 2nd knee replacement in November 2015.  With Becky's help I recovered a good 6 months quicker than my previous knee replacement.  Came back for rehab after torn rotator cuff surgery in January 2016. This is an extremely difficult process but once again Becky got me back to normal in 3 months.  I've also worked with Amanda and Kevin during Becky's absence.  They are all highly skilled and very professional.  Lisa at the front desk is great too.
5 I am new here to the area and looking for a family practitioner. I met w Dr Chen and he is an amazingly caring doctor with a great bedside manner. He is a man of faith and it's comforting to know he will be honest and caring with me as a patient.   His exam room is clean and comfortable. I am happy that I made a decision to come here.
5 Gregor is the best! If you want a deep massage or have any muscular problem or injury, you won't find anyone better or more knowledgeable to fix you.  I had a bad hamstring pull which no one was able to fix. Gregor not only repaired the it my body has never felt better.  The other great thing about this place is the customer service. He is always on Te and the place is clean I will never be able to go any where else.  Gy
1 Ugh, I almost never go to the doctor, and the only time I needed to go it was my mistake to end up at this place. I called and asked if they are a network provider with my insurance and they said yes. The visit alone was expensive, I'm not even sure if that was with my insurance. On top of that, I received a bill a month later for lab tests! who does that? I thought I was done paying at the office and I was not even notified I was going to get billed. Dr. Grobe was ok, although she seemed judgmental of my response when asked about my safe sex practices. The front office staff are very unprofessional, rushing me to complete paperwork when I had gotten there early enough for my appointment. I would have rather gone to planned parenthood or urgent care than this overrated "wellness" spa place. What a waste of time.. When I walk into a Dr Office I expect to see scrubs and white coats and stethoscopes, not sandals, spaghetti strap shirts that look like they are going some place other than their professional jobs.
5 Been coming here for a little over a year now. I love it. I feel so alive. I would recommend this place to everyone.
4 I really like the doctors and how enthusiastic and positive they were about my knee surgery. I think they did good work for the most part. The only thing I was not happy about is they never followed up with me regarding PT after my surgery. I went to one session and never heard back from them. I think I really missed out by not following through with PT, but I was depending on them to let me know how to progress through my recovery, and I feel they just dropped the ball.
2 I went in with a sore throat, recent cough, body aches, shortness of breath, and feeling fluish. They performed a strep test which was negative. Then the doctor came in and started asking questions about my symptoms. He said "people don't just come in here with a sore throat after a day. What's the real reason you're here? What's really going on here?"   I was so confused?!? Is he accusing me of lying about my symptoms, coming in for medication, hypochondriac, or just wasting his time? First of all, I said the cough has been for a day, the sore throat has been for a few days. He said "well it's not strep, what do you think it could be?" Sir, I didn't go to medical school. I'm about as medically trained as other fools on Google. I have a biology degree which I guess gives me some bacteria/viral knowledge but I'm not diagnosing myself. That's why I'm here. So he starts rambling on about mono. I am pretty certain this isn't something I have. But we do a mono test, negative. They are out of rapid flu tests so they swab me with the flu test but have to send out to a lab, about 4 hours for results per Doctor. The chick that swabbed me said results in 2 days! What the hell??   I called 7 hours later to check if results are in and the man said "these tests don't get picked up until night time, you were misinformed" but he checked in my file, said he would look into it, and did call me back about 10 minutes later. Flu is negative. I still have no answers here. My toddler had pneumonia 3 months ago and has been battling "daycare colds" for months. I probably caught something from her. But it would be nice to have a diagnosis (especially since I'm pregnant currently) and not be treated like I'm coming in with symptoms of a hypochondriac. Don't question your patients and ask "what's the real reason you're here?" It's rude. I will never come back to this Urgent Care. You get better service and are well taken care of at the Walgreens walk in place. I'm still left with no diagnosis as I lay on my couch unable to talk from pain, body aches, and feeling like crap.
5 Dr. Reed provides excellent care. His healing touch has helped keep my back and neck in alignment and my stress level under control. He has always given great advice on natural supplements, and his office manager is kind and friendly. He also does not waste your time. You spend very little time in the waiting area and get help immediately. I would recommend him to anyone who is suffering migraines or back pain.
4 Sumits Biltmore has been my go-to yoga studio since I moved here about 2 years ago.  The style of yoga is a combination of bikram and ashtanga.  Utilizes fast-paced movements to keep the heartrate up, while taking time to focus on various standing postures.  All in all I do like the style and the different music makes the class fly by.  They keep the room nice and hot & steamy-- just the way I like it.  When it comes to yoga, the hotter the better!    Great for beginners to advanced yogi's-- easy to catch on to the routine, yet still challenging if you have been coming for awhile.  All of the instructors I've had have been great with tons of positive energy!  Try the 2 weeks for 20 -- if you like it, do yourself a favor and get on their e-mail list serve.  They will send out emails periodically for customer appreciations days and such where you get discounts off the packages to make it more affordable.
5 Friendly staff, always clean, and short wait time. I will keep coming back here for my walk-in needs
5 Was here at ER two times in two weeks for husbands heart issues. Both were wonderful experiences given the stress of being at the ER and one overnight stay the fist time. ...communication was OUtstanding, ER & other staff was so good, food was even good. So glad we ended up @ this smaller hosp where you are not treated like a number. Even parking and navigating the hosp is like hitting Staples' Easy Button.....so much better than the bigger hospitals around here.
4 I ended up needing urgent care while on vacation here in Las Vegas. Found this one on Yelp (had great reviews) and drove the 30 minutes just to go.  It WAS the day after Christmas, I guess there was only 1 doctor and after waiting for 40 minutes and seeing maybe 2-3 people go in, I gave up. The staff was wonderful and the girl suggested I go to another location. She called the Tropicana site and they were not busy at all. I ended up going there . . .   So, my 4 stars are for the cleanliness/staff and way they conducted the wait room. They were very nice, didn't seem stressed or short with patients, but did their best with what they had. I'm sure it was a challenging day for them.
5 I have been to chiropractors from AZ to Ohio and these guys rock it. Great staff , very friendly and they have a great massage crew. My maintenance treatments keep me straight and strong till my next visit. Give them a try ....I think you will like this outfit...5 stars!
5 I just found this doctor and he is by far the best i have seen in a long time! Very quick service, very caring and extremelly helpful!! Definetly recommend going there!
1 This is the Comcast of care providers and it has the same level of customer service. This is the single worst office I have ever been in and the fact that it disguises itself as a medical office only makes this worse.   I have never reviewed a place before. I literally only signed up for yelp because this is a medical institution that needs to be held to higher standards that a local burger spot and I want the good people who need medical treatment not to be taken advantage of by this office.   And just for context, my mother is a nurse and my wife is a doctor.   Let me share:  I filled out my preappointment forms online 3 days before my visit. All I needed was the office to take over my prescription from my previous out of state doctor. Last time I did this, the doctor's office took care of this in a few hours.  Super professional, fast and effective.   I showed up to my appointment early. I waited around for about 30 mins after my appointment time had passed before anyone acknowledged me. The nurse was callous and rude. It was like I was at some fast food place a few minutes before closing and I was ruining her fun. She barely looked at me, sighed and huffed when I asked her to repeat her mumbled questions. She didn't even know why I was there! She said she didn't receive my records from the previous office yet. And she said aren't you here for a physical? Unbelievable. The doctor was the only saving grace but she didn't have anything to do because I was only there for my medicine.   As of my writing this roughly 2 weeks after my appointment I STILL DO NOT have any Medicine . I called a week after my appointment and asked if it was ready for pick up and after he confirmed my info he said "yes, just waiting for you to pick it up" awesome....  I leave work early again for the second time to get to the office and they have no idea what I'm talking about it and they interrogate me asking me what number I called, what number I called from and what drugs I require. After answering these same questions multiple times I finally speak to a manager who apologizes and says this practice of front office staff telling patients to come in is a frequent thing (what?!) and that she will personally call my former doctor and get the records.   Yelp, this is week 2 and I don't have my medication. Thank God this is not life or death because I would have been dead by now if I needed this for my heart or blood pressure.   I called again this Friday on 2 separate occasions and not once did they answer or give me a call back.   How is this legal?    This is the most unprofessional care provider I have ever visited and it's shameful that 0 starts cannot be given.  You will waste your time,  money and patience on these folks.   Find a small, local doctor that will treat you with the dignity and respect you deserve   If anyone is reading this from Arrowhead, I am going to post this review everywhere I can.
5 My husband and I have been coming to Davidson Family Medicine for several years now, driving all the way up from Charlotte because of the great care we continue to receive. The front desk staff, lab staff, and medical staff are always very personable while still being professional. The doctors and PAs never rush you in and out, and are genuinely interested in keeping you healthy!
5 This urgent care is awesome! I was in and out in 1 hour and that was with X-rays. Dr. Copeland was really nice and very professional. From the from desk guy to the radiologist; everyone there was helpful and friendly. I would highly recommend this urgent care
5 I wasn't able to walk when I came to see Dr Palmer due to a serious back spasm. I had just come from a chiropractor that I didn't have a great experience with and I was pretty desperate for relief. Fortunately, several friends had already recommended Ben to me and when I called, he happened to have an opening within the hour. He was attentive and knowledgeable, and I felt immediately comfortable with the treatments he was recommending. After a dry needling session and patching me up, I had significantly less pain and increased range of motion. Ben went the extra mile and sent me videos of the exercises for me to work on over the next few days, setting up realistic goals for progress. I'm impressed!
5 Very Knowledgeable staff.Great looking facility. Plenty of parking around.I'm going through rehab now and seems to be working.
5 Today I went in for annual Pap smear and even though I'm 39 but my mom was just diagnosed with breast cancer. I expressed my concerned and although he said mammograms are done at age 40, but because of my concerns he was going to order one for me. His response made me very happy.  My Pap smear was fast and he was gentil. He called his medical Assistant in before he did the exam and I appreciate that very much, I didn't have to ask for him to do so.  Front office staff was profesional and friendly. A pleasure to finally have found such a nice, clean office with outstanding service.  The email and text services are also convenient for people like me that have tons of things to do and tend to forget about personal appt. I was also received a test from the office having a cancellation and offering me a sooner appt than my scheduled one. That was nice for a change.  I will continue my care with Centennial OB/GYN.
1 Zero stars if I could. Miserable staff, registration requires a debit card (can you get more sleazy?), and the longest wait times of any minute clinic I've ever been to.   Coughed my lungs out for over an hour before walking out. Stay away.
5 I had my first massage with Davonna on March 14th, as I've been having some serious issues with my back and my chiropractor recommended a massage with someone who can help work out the knots and adhesions. Davonna immediately came to mind, as with her education and background I knew she'd know what to do. Well, she sure did! She even gave me some stretching exercises to help improve my back problems. Boy was I sore that night and the next day, but icing it like she told me to helped with that.   As of Monday, March 17th, the soreness is pretty much gone, as is the pain. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU Davonna for knowing what to do to help me! You are an angel and a lifesaver! I am so glad I met you and that you are in my building so I have NO excuses for not taking care of my back.
5 My girlfriend was there for about 4 days in the labor and delivery section and have never been happier with the experience. All the nurses went above and beyond to make my girlfriend and I comfortable and happy. I will say, the temperature in the rooms fluctuated a lot, we were in 2 different rooms and they would both go from chilly to really warm. It wasn't too uncomfortable but it was something i noticed and overall we had a really good experience there. Also, at the end we were given so many extra baby things to take home which was really nice and convenient.
4 I came here for an allergy test with Dr. Vadas. He and his staff were very friendly and explained all the steps that I needed to take very clearly, which I greatly appreciated. They took the time to answer my questions and make me feel at ease, particularly during the prick test, which went by very quickly.  I kind of wonder about the quality of the tests, though, since I am incredibly allergic to cats (2 hours in a room and I lose the ability to breathe) and my cat allergy test came up negative. I wonder if it's some residual allergy meds that I took earlier that week, but it was before the stated 3-day cutoff. Then again, I take allergy meds maybe 5 times a year, so maybe they stay in my system longer? I don't know.  Anyhow, the clinic was clean, though a bit tough to find.
4 These people are awesome. My 4 year actually just told me that going to "his appointment" here was better than going to Tae Kwon Do! Winning.
5 I have been coming to Dr Skabo for close to 3 years now and I have never been happier. I feel fantastic, struggled with back pain most of my adult life until I found him and his practice. The man works miracles IMO.  No sales pitch, no pressure, he is a very compassionate and smart chiropractor who will not rest until you are feeling better. I may be moving out of state and I am truly nervous I won't find a Chiro as good as him, he set the bar very high. Go see him, you will not regret it.
1 I read the reviews here on Yelp and really thought I had found a place to help with my constant neck and low back pain. However.... Called them in the morning and asked if they accepted my insurance.  They said that they did accept my insurance. Made an appointment for that afternoon.  Took time off of work, showed up 30 minutes early, filled out the new patient forms and was then told that I could not use my insurance for the chiropractor.  Since the chiropractor was not in my insurance's network, they wanted me to pay $100 (my normal copay is $35). When the appointment was made they specifically said two things: 1. They accepted my insurance 2. I would see the chiropractor on the first visit If they knew that I was going to see the chiropractor, they should have also known that the chiropractor would not be covered by my insurance.  This is extremely frustrating.  I am not quite sure if this "mistake" is just plain incompetence or actually unethical business practice. Either way, I do not think I will be returning to this facility. I can't speak to the efficacy of the treatment staff, but i can say that I do not trust the administrative department (the people that will communicate with my insurance and actually facilitate my financial ability to receive treatment). Unfortunately, I am still in pain, and still searching for treatment.
4 I was introduced to Dr. Kinel by my daughter when I moved to Sumerlin and have found him to be an excellent Doctor with a willing to listen without being rushed and an excellent Doctor. I speak with some what authority as my husband was a physician and he would agree with Dr. Kinels professional learned matter. His office assistant is always kind and courteous.
5 This place is amazing great staff the massage and the back adjustment was satisfying I would definitely come back..  Thank you
5 Dr. Dave at OSR Physical Therapy really knows what he's doing. His staff is also great.  I had a double hip replacement and switched from another physical therapy.  Dr. Dave was able to zero in on the root of my pain, break up scar tissue, apply both physical therapy and massage therapy to assist me to walk normally again with a new prosthesis in each hip.  Until I switched to Dr. Dave, I had very little improvement.  I'm now beginning to make some noticeable progress after just a few sessions.  I couldn't be happier to make progress again finally. Dr. Dave really cares about his patients and their progress.
5 Lyons Physical Therapy is the BEST therapy place in Las Vegas!  John Lyons and his amazing staff helped me when I had the worst pain in my life after being involved in a car accident. I must say I left that place with O% pain. Very much recommend!
5 The Team at this physical Therapy office helped restore my leg after my ACL Surgery December 27th 2012.  The entire staff make you feel like family not like a patient.  They cared about me as an individual and what treatment I needed to regain use of my leg.  I would not be where I am today physically without the care of this physical Therapy office.  I would highly recommend them to any and everyone I know that needs Physical Therapy.
5 I was new to Pilates  -  and so happy that Lesley and her team at the Pilates Center of Pittsburgh were there to convert me to this incredible practice.  I have been a yogi for years and could not imagine how Pilates would be different. Oh was I wrong!   The teachers and practice is created to be personalized and the exercises are so focused on fine movement, particularly the pelvis. If you have hip or back or leg or honestly any issues (who doesn't?!) buy an Introductory Pack, work out for one month and tell me you're not hooked.   They teach classical Pilates so you learn from the BEST and the purists teaching the Pilates Method.  This is not a fad place but an honest to goodness wellness center using Pilates to connect with and build up strength in your body.
4 I find this place to have very proactive Therapists, and surprise, you actually see a therapist instead of being handed off to a cadre of assistants. My Therapist is Sally Basta, and she has been very helpful in explaining every step of the process and administering the best personal care. All of the staff I've encountered have been positive and friendly. I have no reservations giving this place a recommendation to anyone seeking quality care.
5 I came to Miller PT with a serious shoulder injury and near constant pain.  The knowledgeable staff helped me to regain my strength and mobility, and eliminate the majority of my pain.  I highly recommend Miller PT!
1 They had me waiting in the lobby over an hour and half past my scheduled appointment time and I wasn't even seen. When I asked them how much longer I would have to wait they said they couldn't provide me with a time and that I would have to "wait and see." This was a terrible experience for a family practice. Do NOT recommend new patients like myself to come here.
5 Dr Burroff is quick and thorough , his staff always gets me in when I'm in need. He is very caring but also a no BS kind of a guy he tells you like it is. I refer all my patients to him and will continue to do so.
5 Been seeing Dr Riley for years. He recently moved to Banner Healthcare. I like him. He has called me at home a couple of times to check on me. I was pretty ill but how often have you had that happen?!  He is a great doctor and a compassionate human being. And he loves fly fishing!
5 The entire staff here is amazing! They take away the pain and stress in my back/neck every week!!
1 I would not recommend this place! I thoroughly believe what they are doing here borders on unethical medical practice guidelines. You never see the actual doctor, you see the PAs but are not informed about this unless you ask. In the last year they have misread lab work to me, messed up prescriptions (sending in wrong prescriptions) and billed me incorrectly. Although, I've requested multiple times in the last month, I have yet to receive a call back from their office manager.
5 I had an aneurysm 2 years ago that paralyzed my right side, and from coming year only four times it already feels amazing and I have better posture is so much better so I highly recommend this office and Dr. Mike. They just moved to a new building with much more room and equipment. Five stars all the way! Dr. Mike is thorough and precise and personable and nice as can be. And he makes you feel like you have your own private session that's how much attention he pays to you and how much care he puts into his work. And the stuff is super friendly and does their job with pride. It's the only of this I would go to in the area, in the valley!
5 I took my mother here for a check up and the staff were very helpful and friendly.  Dr. Rober Gaimaro truly cared for my  mother and treated her very gently and gave her a thorough examination. He knew that my mother also did not have any health insurance therefore he recommended some alternatives that are cheaper for her prescriptions and also told us where to go that were offering generic specials. This is truely a place where the Dr. himself and staff cares for you and not just your money. I love this place, my mother who had been through so many other clinic who had treated her badly will never go anywhere else  but here. I recommend this place to anyone and also specially to the elderly people.
5 I've gone here for over 10 years and they always help me I personally believe they are the best office in Phoenix and I love the woman over the phone they are always nice.
5 **Review for clinic on Rural/Elliot**  SHOCKED at the quality of service...  Knock on wood, with three boys and all their activities, I can count on one hand the times we've had to use an urgent care or the emergency room. I've heard all the horror stories of long wait times, rude burnt out staff and lackluster Docs... so I was already preparing myself when I loaded my husband in the car with what we suspected were broken ribs. (combat sports)  I called ahead and asked the wait time...10 minutes, and yes they do Xray's.   I get there and we were greeted by a young reception, for 8:30 (closing time at 9) I expected attitude...none, very helpful and responsive. The clinic is clean and very organized!  They took my husband in the back, a few minutes called me back there to wait with him then the Doc came in. She was absolutely professional, smiling and making us feel comfortable. Extremely thorough with her explanations and was very willing to answer all questions.   I even made a comment to my husband that I liked her better than our regular family physician...he's nice, but sometimes seems rushed...  I would absolutely go back...let's face it, the medical industry is as much a competitive market as a retailer these days...these guys get it...they get that we aren't just patients...we are customers and we have choices.   I highly recommend this urgent care clinic.
5 These guys are top notch from top to bottom. Had the whole family taken care of and have been coming for years! Doug, dr. Jared, dr. Eker are the best.
2 We came to this location because the location on Litchfield Rd didn't have any x-ray techs on staff. The first desk was great, the staff in the back was rude and unprofessional with the exception of the doctor. They got upset because my husband needed an x-ray and they had just shut down the machine... Granted we did go about 60-45 min prior to when they closed. They made us feel like we were inconveniencing them.
5 Very professional and caring staff.  Dr. Nicknam is easy to talk to and answers the questions in details. Would definitely recommend this place. Could improve on the waiting time.
1 Called yesterday to book an appointment for a mammogram screening  and bone density test.  I called back today to get an idea of what they charge for these tests and MRI's.  Each provider charges a different amount.  Most hospitals or facilities I've called in the past are able to provide pricing for lab or radiology procedures.  I talked to three different people at SimonMed (financial services, customer service, and billing) and none of them understood my question.  She kept on telling me that payment would depend on my insurance and plan as it varies by insurance. I was completely aware of this as I have done medical billing.  I tried wording my question differently but to no avail.    Based on my research and review of this company and personal experiences, they do not have competent and knowledgeable people in the billing or financial services dept.  I don't like the fact that they can't tell you how much to expect to pay especially when they REQUIRE you to pay at the time of visit.  Most providers bill insurance first and then bills patients for their responsibility based on the EOB (explanation of benefit) which is how it should be because it's very difficult to get refunds from medical providers once you've paid them upfront.  Read some of the reviews to confirm this truth. My suggestion is that you work out a payment arrangement upfront and then wait to see what your insurance pays.
5 I am a floor RN so I see /talk to all kinds of doctors and specialist all day and been with Marleena for years. I even followed her when she left the previous practice.  Yes she is a PA BUT what people need to realize is that this a a family practice. Just because your an MD DOES NOT mean you will always know what's wrong with the patient. That's why we run tests, and give referrers to SPECIALISTS that SPECIALIZE in certain areas of the human body. So to the negative reviewers out there don't diss on Marleena . She's a nice lady that LISTENS to the patient and then gives HER medical opinion. Which is all any good MD can do. If you don't agree with her medical opinion you can always seek out someone elses. I love her and would recommend her to ANY OF my friends and family.  As for the front desk staff...let's just say I miss the practice she was at BUT she is worth it. Also I have encountered WAY worse  in Las Vegas... they are not bad. However I have called three times today and the recording keeps telling me to call during regular business hours...wonder what's going on!
5 Dr Pete is great. Our daughter was suffering from terrible ear infections. Even with tubes. Finally somebody told us to go see Dr Pete and since then our little girl has been ear infection free and her parents have been able to sleep at night once again. Thanks so much Dr Pete.
5 I totally disagree with all these negative reviews. I have seen Dr Belsky for quite some time and she is a warm, caring doctor who genuinely cares for her patients. She has never tried to push high priced procedures on me. She discusses with you pain relieving options other than just pain medication based on your needs. I  have seen other patients in the office who come in behaving extraordinarily rude because it seems that is their personality and I suspect it's these people that are writing bad reviews. If you want a compassionate, down to earth doctor then Dr Belsky is a great choice. If you want a cold, uncaring doctor with no bedside manner choose someone else. I  will continue to see Dr Belsky for as long as I need pain management. The office is exceptionally clean and wait time is practically none. Maybe 5 minutes at most. I  wouldn't trust my health to anyone else
5 I have been living in the valley for nearly 5yrs and Never found a doctor that actually cared about my health and healing. Well, finally I have! I am so thankful.  Dr Brewster took the time to really listen to me and evaluate my situation. I am so thankful I finally found a doctor who cares and takes time for their patients in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area.  Office is very clean and friendly, as well.
1 Ordered a product online and paid for for expedited shipping.  Itr has now been 12 days. I called them after one week and they basically told me it would be there when it was there. Very rude and unaplologetic customer service.
5 I had a total knee replacement and was with ATI physical therapy for almost 8 weeks.  The help I received from Bethany, Ricardo and Crystal was incredible.  They pushed me, but not beyond my capability.  When I had the day that I was in a deep funk, they were very understanding, having me do my exercises, but not being mean about it.  I would highly recommend this facility and these people I had working with me.
5 FIRST TIME HERE ..... hmmmmmmm As we entered the facility we were welcomed with a comfortable hello... The staff is friendly and very open,talkative and we'll entertaining...music is great and all in all great team overall.... Thank you team N&B Southwest....and I also wanted to win the giveaway LoL
5 If you want to go to the best doctor in Vegas, than go here. Dr. George is young and very smart. He will treat everyone and knows his stuff.  His office is very busy because everyone goes here. So you def. need to make an appointment. They accept many insurance carriers and are really helpful if you need a referral for anything.  I would never consider switching to a different doctor. Anyone who goes here would be beyond satisfied.
5 If you're looking for quality, personal physical therapy, OTW is your place!  Pam Neuharth is knowledgeable, yet able to explain things in plain English.  She clearly loves what she does and takes a personal interest in seeing and being a part of your improvement.
1 very poor customer service. i have been go there too many times and i can't be patient anymore. Even though i made an appointment i still have to wait at least 1:30 it doesn't make sense to me. now i decide that i will never go back again
1 Let me just start this has nothing to do with Dr. Garcia. I found her absolutely wonderful. She was very caring and took the time enough though she was running an hour and half behind schedule. But the office policies are a joke. I was prescribed a  medication which I found out was not on my insurance formulary. An easy fix normally. All it need was a prior authorized done so that the insurance company would cover it. But nope, this office doesn't do prior authorizations. You have to schedule another appointment just so that they can prescribe you something else that could possibly also not be on your insurance formulary. Seems like this "Family Friendly" Clinic is not so family friend and is just all about the $$$ they would gain from the second and possible third visit. I have never been to a clinic that wouldn't do the prior authorization, or just write a alternate prescription. If you are looking for help with a medical condition I was beware of this place.
1 Wow, I thought I might be alone in how awful my experience was with NASM, but now that I see other scores, clearly I am not.  As the other reviews are saying, this place is run by scam artists, once they take your money, they don't give a damn about you.  They have absolutely 0 heart whatsoever as well when it comes to your medical issues that get in the way of taking your test.  They absolutely refused to give me my money back, even after writing a detailed letter explaining my health issues (as well as detailed medical records), as well as the fact that I only purchased the course because my employer at the time pressured me into it.  When I got sick, the employer replaced me, and I was left with this test that I originally had no intention at all to take (I left the training industry years before this.)  I had evidence that this was turning into a legal battle with my previous employer, and they didn't give a damn at all.  Apparently a million dollar corporation really needs to keep $350 from someone who is on MEDICAL and can't afford better insurance.    My experience getting other certs, is that NASM is not even slightly a cut above anyone else.  In fact, I have found that most of the other certs I had at the time, the knowledge I gain from those are comparable, if not BETTER than NASM.  If you don't believe the multitude of negative reviews here, go ahead and read the ripoff report.  NASM is SCUM.
1 This place is the worst. If it wasn't for my company sending me here I wouldn't be here. Everytime I come in have an appointment but still sit for 2-3 hours. The nurse said we tell everyone there is a wait, then what is the point of having and appointment. And the reuse medical equipment that is one use only.
5 If you need short-term nursing care and rehabilitation following a surgery, this is the place to get it.    Dear Mom is currently here following back surgery, and what a place it is!  This is an excellent alternative to a nursing home.  We have nicknamed this place the Taj Majal.    The rooms are all private suites, beautifully decorated and luxurious.  There is 24-hour nursing care, great dining facilities, and rehabilitation services.  Mom's insurance covers the costs.  The staff is very attentive and the place is spotless.  It smells great- like a hotel, not a hospital.  The staff is professional and friendly, and not only do they remember the details about Mom, they remember who we are.  T too.  The public facilities are as luxurious as any nice resort.  Heck, I'd consider vacationing here if they did price fixe and cocktails!
1 (Update 11/20/15) Paid $15 to cancel back in September, they just charged me $25 for November, Bravo!....  Worst gym I've ever been to.  Even while deployed to eastern Africa, the gym in that tent, was x1000 BETTER.  The people here are not friendly (employees & patrons), their process at "check-in" is terrible, they have an iPad for your guest to register and check in every time.  They point that laser gun right at your face trying to scan your card. Now the patrons, omg, where do these people come from? the dirtiest, most stinky people, loud and rude.  Every time I worked out here I got itchy as hell from using their equipment, people here are always staring at you without a drop of shame. This place stinks, it smells like a porta-potty.  The cardio theater is ridiculous, 80% of the equipment in there is broken, if you try to actually run in there you'll be interrupting the movie because of how loud those old POS treadmills are.  Personally I would not go back here, even with a free membership. Most of their equipment doesn't work, outdated and not enough equipment to go around. I was paying 25$ a month to have guest come in with me, it felt like a conjugal visit in jail for them, really, it was horrible.  I tried to give it a change, but it's insanely ridiculous.  Some of the characters that frequent this gym are too much for me.  I'm pretty sure I saw a guy with an tracking ankle bracelet.  Just last night, when I decided to cancel, there was a guy working out by the dumbbells, he was doing over head press with free weights, when all of a sudden, one of the just fell apart!!! 40 lbs of lose weights fell on his head!! one of the employees (black buy with a gray polo and black pants) brought him a trash bag with ice, and stepped back to chat with some patrons while the injured guy sat there, with a bag of ice on his head about to pass out! and this employee chatting with some people not giving a damn! completely ridiculous.  After a while he realized that person shouldn't be seating on the workout equipment anymore, so they took that person over to the desks area behind reception.  that's when I walked out, that was it for me. I'll gladly pay the $15 bucks to cancel, make it $100, to end this nightmare, well worth it.
1 It's no more than a clinic. Save yourself the frustration and disappointment and go to a real hospital.
1 I HAD A CANCEROUS TUMOR, she dismissed me as "liking drama" I went to see her in Sept 2011 as a walk in because of excruciating pain close to my coccyx . I was sitting there crying from the pain and after 3 hours I was told she would not see me and I had to go to urgent care.  10/13/2011 Every time I go there she has different staff. Tiny waiting room, after waiting an hour to see her she would not do a back adjustment for me because it was not on the "schedule" because of staff mistake. I had pre aproval from my insurance and it was the primary reason why I was there. I was told other patients were waiting, I was there first! and waited an hour! I wanted a refund for my visit because services where not rendered and the nurse did not know how to do it so I was told to take it up with my credit card company! I refused to leave without my money and the doctor CALLED THE POLICE to have me removed! Finally another patient showed the nurse how to process a refund and I left just as the police arrived. She does not do walk ins and does not work Monday or Friday. Her schedule was more important than my care, I was willing to overlook the staff turnover and lack of organization because I liked her and her back adjustments where great but after this I will never go back!!!!! Sept 3rd, 2013. I'm copying an pasting my review from 10/13/11 just to let you all know that the pain in my back turned out to be COLO-RECTAL CANCER.The day she threw me out of her office she told the nurse behind the famous shower curtain that divides the waiting room from the patients rooms that "I liked drama". Thanks for not caring Lydia, if you had ordered a MRI and diagnosed me properly the cancer would have been found in time to save me from colon resection surgery.
5 Dr. Dom and Dr. Matt are the BEST - I can't even express how much we miss coming to Arcadia Health and Wellness. We moved to LA last year and were so sad that we couldn't take Dr. Dom with us. Every time I'm in Phoenix, I make sure to schedule an appointment, and try to convince him to move to LA because we still haven't found anyone who provides the same care. I (half-jokingly) say that we'll move back to Phoenix just for Dr. Dom!  Another CrossFitter/weightlifter recommended Dr. Dom, and I liked that he was knowledgable about the sports and had treated athletes like me before. I came in with neck/shoulder pain and frequent tension headaches, and six months later, my overhead stability improved and my headaches and pain were gone. CrossFit and Olympic weightlifting put a lot of wear and tear on my body, and Dr. Dom's treatments and at-home exercises helped me recover and get stronger. He also taught us how to do self-care at home with pressure points, foam rolling, and the S-hook; I love that Dr. Dom cares enough to make sure that his patients have all the knowledge to do the work at home so that they can get better and work on preventing future pain.  Thank you again for helping me get better and stronger!  P.S. I love and miss Candice!
5 They have great team of doctors they're very professional they treat you really well you got a great bedside manner. Their programs are top-notch. I've had several procedures done such as the pain stimulator I'm almost completely pain-free I'll alter them they are excellent and everything they do.
5 I found this clinic on Yelp last week when my regular massage therapy clinic was closed - and I had such a great experience that I'm switching to them permanently. Their staff is super professional and friendly, their offices are very clean, and they offer direct billing - a huge time saver for anyone claiming their appointment with an insurance provider. All in all a great experience.  I highly recommend going here.
5 I just started going here and the Drs and staff have been outstanding! I was seen when promised, received reminder texts about apointments and have had good experiences with everyone I came in contact with. I would highly recommend them. I can't help but feel that the reviews that are not 4 to 5 stars are only telling you what they want you to think and not the truth. If you don't get a reminder text, maybe you gave them the wrong #. If you are late to an appointment, of course they are gonna take another patient back.  This is a great place with great staff! Go see for yourself.
1 They accepted my son who had be in an accident and was not able to put any weight on his feet for 90 days. Not able to get him his pain meds on time, or clean his wounds or even remember to feed him. In short very few are skilled at this facility and all are over worked. WE discovered his foot was becoming infected, and the response was " I'll tell somebody", this was always the response to everything. We called his surgeon and he wanted him in at the E. R. immediately. " I'll tell somebody,. Should I call a Dr.? He could be here in the morning" DO NOT SEND SOMEONE YOU LOVE TO THIS PLACE
1 19 years ago I was bringing my children and husband here. This was our family doctor's office at a different location. They had fantastic doctors and we knew them all quite well. Over  the years, I watched as the office became a commercialized joke and none of the original doc's are there. We have gone for serious issues and been given "bandaid" service prior to ending up in hospitals and urgent care centers. I even watched as physical therapists and chiro's that I had been seeing for years suddenly got sloppy and instead of the reliable chiro adjustments that had kept me walking, I was leaving completely out of alignment and telling them so but they wouldn't take the time to fix my back.  After posting this, I recieved a phone call from Mike, who assured me that the reasons I used to love this place still exist. He has reached out to ask us to give them another chance. He says that the doctors I used to see are not all gone, and that they are passionate about patient comfort, trust and satisfaction. I have to say that I really REALLY miss that old family doctor experience where you can trust your health to someone who cares just as much about you, as you do. I will give them another chance because honestly, I haven't found anything like it since. I will repost as soon as I get a chance to go and I truly hope things will improve.
5 Had to get stitches for the first time in 30 years. The first visit, the follow-up and removal were all quick, painless and done by friendly, competent staff.  Great overall experience!
5 I came in to Triple Threat Performance with 22% body fat and a hurt shoulder that 3 months of physical therapy failed to make better. Three months later with Ethan's programing and attention I am now approaching 15% body fat, have put on a bunch of lean muscle, Feel more confident than ever, and magically my shoulder is completely healed and back to 100%!  Hands down, this is the place to go if you want to get into the best shape of your life! Most of us have physical goals but often feel trapped by our lack of knowledge and the ensuing lack of results. Ethan and his team sat down to really listen to my goals and created a detailed eating and workout plan that was manageable with my busy schedule which was incredible!  I will continue to refer all of my friends and family that want to really get serious and accomplish their physical goals that had always just been hopes and dreams. Ethan and his team can give you the tools to get there much faster than you think!
5 Wer noch Angst vor einem Arzt hat, der kennt den Allgemeinmediziner M.Kampschulte noch nicht.    Super nett und sehr kompetent. Ein Mediziner, der auch die Kräfte der Natur immer mit einbezieht.
5 I was very fortunate to be able to have Tom work on my legs when he was in Los Angeles - He is the absolute best!  Very friendly, respectful, and knowledgeable. He pinpointed my knee problems quickly (I was so surprised, what I assumed was a problem in my knee was actually being caused by weak butt muscles! I never would have figured that on my own) and the exercises he showed me were simple movements that were so effective - and they were movements that I didn't have to do in a gym setting. It was so helpful that I could do strengthening exercises at home.  After such a great experience with Tom, I can't imagine going anywhere else for my physical therapy needs.  We're missing out in Los Angeles, but everyone in Scottsdale and the surrounding area are VERY lucky to have such an amazing physical therapist to go to!
5 I've been a patient at Dr. Butler's practice since 2009 and have received consistent, practical, efficient and professional care. Dr. Butler is a direct communicator so if you are looking for someone to tap dance around your feelings when it's time to take better care of yourself, well, you may want to keep shopping. But all medical advice is delivered with kindness and a sense that you are a partner in your own health care decisions - as it should be. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. I've been able to get in same day when needed. They have an x-ray and EKG onsite which is a nice touch.
3 I have to give Dr Fisher credit for a couple of things.  He was one of the few physicians in Phoenix who would touch AIDS patients in the 1980s.  He's also one of the few doc's around the metro area who will prescribe Truvada as PREP.    In other respects, however, this guy's medical career is probably way past its prime.  On my first visit to this office 18 months ago, Dr Fisher was unusually thorough and thoughtful, but subsequent appointments have been hurried and perfunctory.  And on one occasion earlier this year, I thought Dr Fisher went way too far in asking personal details about my employment and marriage, in the absence of any apparent medical reason for doing so.    The office environment is cluttered and dusty with paperwork and supplies stacked here, there and everywhere.  That doesn't inspire thoughts of quality and confidence.  The new medical assistant I encountered on my last visit also came off and snooty and perfunctory, like I wasn't attractive enough to warrant his sustained attention. Fisher closed the lab in his office, too, which was another reason I was initially attracted to this practice.  I'll probably continue to see Fisher for PREP, but find another doc for routine healthcare matters.
5 Above and Beyond Five Stars I have severe Neuropathic Pain from Type II Diabetes in my feet. I was looking at those expensive  "Specialists" that advertise everywhere and their treatment is either Medication or a Tense Unit Electrical Stimulation. Knowing that this is what Chiropractors do for Back and Neck Pain (and having researched the process plus knowing first hand patients in other states) I started looking for a Chiropractor. My search led me to Dr. Hogan. I could not be more pleased with this excellent caring Doctor. I can finally sleep at night again without the feeling of hundreds of needles jabbing my foot at once, nor the feeling of having spots on my foot ready to catch on fire. I'm hoping to eventually reduce my medications, however for me just having a good nights sleep is incredible.
1 Went in for what I thought was an annual physical (wellness). Besides the nurse taking my blood pressure and heart reading, nothing else was done. Oh, the doctor did listen to my heart. He said I would need blood work done and then asked if there was any concerns. Surprisingly, I asked if that was it and told him I'd like for him to look at my skin as this has traditional been done at previous doctor's as a preventative procedure. The doctor said he would refer me to a dermatologist and sent me on my way. After the blood work was completed, I returned to get the results. I was charged an office visit for him to read the piece of paper he gave me. I then received a bill for both visits. The kicker is that because the doctor asked if I had any concerns, they charged me for an office visit. As I mentioned before, every other time I've gone to a doctor for a preventive visit, they did a thorough visit and examined skin for any unusual moles. Lesson learned. My family won't be going to this office anymore.
1 I really wish I could give them no stars!this is the worse place you could possibly go to.i went in for a dot physical,waited 8 hrs.they kept taking people in before me,that arrived many hours after I arrived.they made me feel like I was a inconveince to them.they are super expensive and don't take my insurance,but I needed my dot and I didn't know other places to go,at the time.stay away,you've been warned
1 Five months later I get another unexpected bill for over $500. I fought with them and told them that this is not right because when I had my blood drawn they told me that everything would go through insurance. I told him that this is very deceptive. They told me that they would write off the $500. This place is very shady! I don't see how they can continue to stay in business. I'm beyond frustrated with them.
5 I've never had a message and thought, wow, that was really good.  Today was different.  Young lady named Tiffany did a fantastik job!  It's true, dynamite comes in small packages! I requested a "heavy" message and this little lady did great!  Front desk staff wss VERY pleasant.  Wonderful visit!  Looking forward to my next vist!
5 Not sure why all the negative reviews, maybe posted by competing clinics? I found Bellagio on Groupon(they have good reviews on there) for laser vein treatment and they asked what kind of treatment and time length I wanted to get. The laser technician Alejandra was friendly and actually ended up treating extra areas that she found. I was impressed. Andrea and Desiree at the front desk were nice.I was done within 45 minutes of arriving.  There was no hard sell or pushing of other products. I will definitely go back!
5 I have been coming to Connected Medical for over a year and Dr. Ross Dye is an excellent Chiropractor.  He is attentive and very helpful on what he does, especially with recovery from CrossFit workouts and running a marathon.  His staff, Alessandra and Chaela are helpful, professional, friendly and always make scheduling an appointment easy. Recently, they added the K-Laser to my treatment.  This has been extremely beneficial and helpful for a nagging shoulder issue.  I had issues with my right shoulder and lower back that the K-Laser completely corrected.  I no longer have issues I was having prior to the laser therapy and my range of motion is better.  I highly recommend Dr. Ross Dye and Connected Medical.
3 Sharon (mammogram) and Kristy (ultrasound) were both extremely friendly, warm and comforting during my tests. They both explained the process well, made sure I was as comfortable as possible and kept me updated. It's nice to have patient and kind people around when you're going through procedures like this.  Based on the service I received, I would have rated SMI 5 starts without a doubt. However, I'm having billling issues and am extremely frustrated. Upon check-in, I was told I owed $180 for services. When I explained I should only owe my $60 co-pay, the lady at the front desk told me she would call my insurance company to confirm. When I checked out, she said she confirmed I owed the full $180. However, when I checked my insurance company portal at later date, I saw that I should have only paid $60 as I thought. My insurance company contacted SMI and confirmed that a refund would be processed. I called SMI 10 days later and was told they did not have record of the "investigation" being started and it would take 4-6 weeks. Even after requesting a supervisor twice, the best they would do is tell me they would process my refund within 4 weeks because a lot of customers needed refunds and the investigation process takes time. So, they made an error and overcharged me 26 days ago, then they forgot to start a dispute, but they still don't care enough about customer service to issue my refund in less than 4 weeks. Unreal!
1 Really unhappy about the care my mother received. Dr. Banister would not return any calls, "the doctor does not take personal calls", was the response to a medication side effect inquiry. In addition, the bill was incorrect- billing for services that did not occur. I've asked my mother to find a new doctor.
4 Waiting room was REALLY small and jam packed with patients. However, I didn't wait more than 5 mins. before I was seen. PA, Jenna, spent a good 30 mins. talking with me and I didn't feel rushed at all. She did have a student PA shadowing her but I didn't mind. An a assistant came in to take my blood and she was competent, friendly and professional. She also said they're planning on expanding on the office to make the waiting room bigger.
1 The Dr's seem okay but their billing department and office department is atrocious to say the least.  They will bill you for things that were already paid and then will continue to harass you to pay it and continue to increase it and add lots of $ on to it.  This is after you have already paid your bill in full during the appointment.  They will change the amounts and threaten and they will not discuss things reasonably.  They will just insist that you pay for their office/clerical errors.  Read the reviews on other sites from past employees and you will hear the same thing from past employees as well as patients.  I wouldn't trust either location just based on their billing practices alone.
4 Receptionists were sweet, the wait wasn't that bad and the doctor was super nice and helpful. He listened, didn't rush me through anything - I was definitely satisfied!  Came here around 6pm on a work day and the line wasn't bad at all.  They're open till 8-9pm which is amazing because it's near impossible to find a good clinic that is open late in Willowdale...  All in all a good experience! Phew...these things are usually hit or miss.  There is a family practice here too, I believe, but I went for walk-in.
1 Wow!  Where to start?  I cut my vacation short to fly back to see Dr. Charles Peterson and when I flew back from Michigan I was rudely told he decided to take a vacation and my appointment has been changed?  I finally got my MRI and was told four months later by my family doctor that I had a sports hernia from the MRI report?  I asked Dr. Peterson why he didn't disclose this information and he lied and said I must have missed him saying it?  What?  I wouldn't have missed something like that!  What a pompous ass.  I then make an appointment for my bi-annual synvisc shot after paying my $50 copay the receptionist who made the appointment messed up and didn't order the synvisc shot?  I had to come back and pay another $50 copay and when I complained Dr. Peterson try to threaten me to drop it or he wouldn't do the injection at all?  I told him I didn't like to be strong armed into obedience and he said we are done and handed me my synvisc shot and told me he wasn't going to be my doctor anymore!  I got dressed and left stunned of the arrogance of this doctor!  2.5 hours wasted for a shot which I never got?  Believe it or not the worst thing is the last cortisone shot he gave me rendered my sore leg that I could walk on aching for five weeks and unable to walk without severe pain and discomfort.  When I went back and told him after the first week I had a golf vacation planned in a week and needed my leg fixed his response to me was "Well, I wanted to date my third grade teacher too". I was numb by the cold callous response from my doctor after a sincere serious concern of mine.  I have never met a more pompous arrogant ass in my life!  Stay away is my warning!
5 Excellent Experience! First time patient:  From the moment we walked in the front desk receptionist, she was welcoming and funny. The nurse who did our intake was pleasantly nice, had a genuine conversation with us. Dr Patel was great, he did not rush us and made us feel welcome. I asked multiple questions of concerns I had and he was able to calm me down and provide solutions that met my needs. Looks like I found my new doctor :-)
1 Front desk was cordial upon check-in. Arrogant and lazy docs!!! Waited just under an hour which is expected mid day, 11am on a Thursday. When taken back to the room, waited more than 30 minutes in the room. Could hear several nurses at the desk chatting away the entire time, not work related so I exit the room and ask if they've forgotten about me. A man and woman sitting there chatting say "nope, you're next". Finally, a man walks into the room and says "I'm Dr Cox" the same man who was sitting at the desk chatting for over 30 minutes while I was sitting waiting in the room for a doctor! Shitty customer service. Get a primary care doc and don't waste your time.
3 Liked the nurse I saw but scheduling was a hot mess. Got charged a no show fee for something I didn't schedule. Things were resolved when I called so at least that was solved.
5 Much to my surprise....for this type of service this was a very pleasant experience Amazing Healing Waters was Amazing..... Looking forward to my next appointment      Thanks Jolli          Carole
5 Dr. Nemanic is very knowledgeable, patient, and gentle.  After trying chiropractics, physical therapy, and massage to heal my lower back problem, I gave up hope and decided to suck it up and just live with the discomfort and limitations.    I went to Dr. Nemanic for an unrelated back issue and mentioned the lower back.  He politely asked if I wanted him to look at my lower back while handling the issue I originally came for.  I said, "sure, what the hell, go for it".  Without x-rays or anything else time consuming and obnoxious, he was able to clearly explain why my lower back was giving me problems and also set realistic expectations for what it would take to fix it.  I am a very active individual and he appreciated that, being one himself.  At no point did he even hint at stopping my activity level, or even lowering it.  Instead, he gave me suggestions to enhance my activity level in a way that would help rather than hurt my body and then told me to simply listen to what my body tells me and stop when it says stop.  That was an approach I could live with and even embrace.    I've only been to Dr. Nemanic one time.  My back problem has existed for years, so one appointment will not fix it; something he patiently explained, even though I knew that already.  However, I left my first appointment being able to bend at my waist without supporting myself on my knees or a desk.  That is HUGE progress.    Whether my lower back will truly be healed or not from his help, I don't know, but I saw progress after my first appointment and have hope that Dr. Nemanic can help me when others could not.  Combine the positive experience, immediate improvement in both my immediate issue and my lower back, as well as the renewal in my hope of healing my lower back and Dr. Nemanic deserves his 5 stars.
5 The best therapy staff in town! 5000 sqft gym is fully equiped. Staff is professional and outcomes driven.
5 I really enjoy the friendly and professional atmosphere. The whole staff really goes out of their way to make you comfortable. I always leave the office feeling better. The Doc isn't heavy handed but not too gentle either. Overall just a really good staff who truly care about your wellness!
2 It was my fault for forgetting about my appointment but isn't a $75 no-show fee kind of high? It was only supposed to be a 10min appointment to go over blood test results. I don't know what other clinics usually charge but according to this article: "The fee should reasonably reflect the cost of the missed appointment, which would in general be about $30 for a regular appointment and $60 for a full physical." http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/ask-a-health-expert/ive-been-billed-for-missing-an-appointment-that-my-doctor-cancelled-twice/article16688690/
1 Should have checked yelp before going to this clinic. After seeing the nurse practitioner last week and needing a blood test I called to find out the results. Their "policy" requires the patient to make an appointment to find out the lab results, which means more money in their pocket because they get to charge me another $50 co-pay!!! They claim patient privacy. That's BS. My previous doctor at another clinic took the time to call me and discuss lab results. Stay away from this clinic. No wonder our healthcare system is a joke.
1 They charged me 300 to draw my blood and sent me a surprise bill for 500. I figured it was some sort of mistake, so I contacted them and they spent days arguing with me over the healow app. I finnaly got a call back from them explaining how it was their fault and I owe 80. They deleted my account on the app and now I can no longer access the labs that cost me 400. Terrible attitude & terrible service I would give no stars if I could.
1 Was referred to Dr Ginsberg by my urologist. Called to set up an appointment as a new patient and of course they asked if i had insurance and through whom.  Told me they honor that insurance.  I took time off from work, went in today started filling out paperwork and they told me that they take that insurance but not that Network. Thanks for wasting my time.  How about training your office staff to ask the right questions? I cant stand incompetency
1 This quack and his team of morons gives the medical industry a bad name. I was looking for a new family doctor so I was trying to find a general practitioner near me that was covered under my insurance. I made an appointment with Dr. Ferdowsian and when I went into the clinic I was given Dr. Clark instead. While a nice guy, Dr. Clark almost never answers questions for you, never gives any information or guidance. I was diagnosed with a few issues but the doctor was in and out of the exam room faster than I could say his name. He put me on some meds (and never told me what for) and bailed. My repeat visit with him was even shorter than the first. I asked questions about my issues and all I got were one or two word answers before he was gone in a flash. I had to come back again twice for different tests and every time I came in, even with an appointment, my wait time was 30-45 minutes. They obviously stack up a zillion patients a day in this place and even early in the morning, it's a guaranteed 30 minute wait.  After returning to get my test results, I was waiting 70 minutes and I decided to leave. They just do not respect your time at all in this clinic. Why they even bother with appointments is beyond me. I rescheduled, this time with Dr. Ferdowsian, because Dr. Clark just was not doing it for me. I didn't trust him, he was unhelpful, and always too busy to provide even adequate care. Also, every time I come in, they act as if they have no idea why I'm there. Whomever is responsible for updating my chart clearly doesn't have a clue of what they are doing.  I return to the clinic at 9 AM for my scheduled time and am left waiting in the exam room for 40 minutes before a technician comes in and tells me the doctor had a previous appointment elsewhere and he's on the way to the clinic now. WTF??? So nobody could have bothered to call me and tell me this? 15 more minutes go by and he's not there so I left. Everyone there kept telling me that "he is on the way" but I didn't care. I rescheduled for this week.  I then arrive on time for my appointment and am, again, left waiting for 50 minutes. When I told the receptionist I was fed up with their poor office management the doctor comes running out from their lab area yelling at me. "DON'T YOU TELL ME HOW TO RUN MY CLINIC!" as he got in my face. I nearly punched him right there. I told him, quite loudly, to go F*#k himself and I stormed out of their office. He then follows me out into the parking lot yelling at me. What an idiot. Avoid this clown and his team of unprofessional idiots who run his office.
1 Apparently the first two visits are "standard protocol to consult with the doctor and establish rapport." Huh??? Basically no treatment for the first two times and it's to milk your insurance! That was problem #1.   #2 was the fact that I waited an hour and twenty minutes and NOT be seen by a doctor. (Which is how I found out that even the second appointment wouldn't include treatment!)   Pain Stop clinic is a scam! The girls up front were rude and seriously sounded like they were reading some newly learned big words and spitting them out at patients and not being sympathetic at the problem at hand. What a waste of hours of my day!
1 It's possible the worst place you can imagine. Was registered there for a wee while and went to see doctors on 3 occasions. 2 of them I went away from surgery in tears. I have never in my life received such a horrible treatment. The only pleasant experience was with the nurse of the surgery. Safe to say I have now changed the surgery
5 SpineScottsdale is the place to go for physical therapy since the spine is their sole focus.  Shane Sullivan is extremely knowledgeable and runs a tight ship.  Shane and his excellent and caring staff take the time to explain in detail what the patient's problems are and why certain exercises are prescribed.  I will definitely return to SpineScottsdale if I need PT for my spine again.
4 I went to Zen for the first time today and had a great experience.  I'm surprised it has so few stars.  I've had massages at a variety of places including Bliss in NYC and various other spas in Vegas, Sonoma, Myrtle Beach and have paid much more than I paid at Zen.  I can honestly say the massage I got at Zen was just as good if not BETTER than the other massages - and MUCH cheaper!  Christine was my massage therapist.  I'd highly recommend her.  She even noticed my hips are uneven causing tight muscles throughout my body.  She wasn't making this up; I was told the same thing by a chiropractor a few years ago.    Another pro - I called Friday night at 7 pm and was able to get in on Saturday at 10 am.    I thought the facilities were great.  The room was quiet and peaceful.  If you're wanting a massage, I'd recommend Zen...and ask for Christine.
5 Both my husband and I have seen Dr. Otten and Dr. Yee. The drs are professional, courteous and take great care of their patients. Our waits have always been reasonable to a busy office. I've recommended this practice to friends before and will continue to. Their initial consults are prompt and informative. Pre and post surgical experience are what I expected. Great drs and staff.
5 For some unknown reason I've had lower to mid back pain for 3 years. About 6 months ago the pain become more consistent (as in daily) scaling between and 8-10 on the pain scale. I've been to multiple specialist who perform radiographs and (never successfully finding anything) and then gladly writing me a prescription for pain meds and taking my copay along withy billing my insurance.  In January I was so desperate for relief I started doing more research. I came across Pains Stop. Was apprehensive at first because of my naivety to chiropractic work. Needless to say, but it needs to be said ;)...my pain is progressively getting better. If I feel pain at all, it is usually at a 2 and I haven't had to take a pill in over a month. Dr Mitch and his team are extremely professional, kind, efficient and most importantly compassionate to your pain. I highly recommend Pain stop as well as this location!!
5 Dr. Yacobucci has given me such great care over the year and a half that I've been seeing him for my shoulders, elbows, and knees (a work-related injury). He has a great "bedside" manor. Matt, his PA, is excellent! An excellent practice all the way around!
5 I had a terrible pain in the back of my neck and that extended down to my back which both were causing a headache. This had been going on for 2 weeks so I was in need of a chiropractor. I did a Yelp and Google search and found Allied Health and saw they were close to my office. I got in that same day when I called and Dr.Ty took care f my issue. The entire staff was friendly and knowledgeable about my issue and identified what I had going on. Highly recommend this place
5 I had been working with Brandon for about a year before he left us for Arizona.  As a bodybuilder I experience a lot of muscle pain and tightness. He helped bring separation to muscle tissue and alleviate my aches and pains. Brandon is extremely knowledgable and as an ex athlete, he can relate to a lot of my sports related injuries. I always left feeling better and he had great tips and exercises to perform at home that have made a huge differences in my overall look and feel.   The only negative is that he moved away!
1 I would not recommend this company because of their misrepresentation, or what is commonly referred to as a lie. I was told that I could avoid a total replacement, by using their cartilage regenerative approach; namely stem cells. I paid for the procedure only to find out, after no followups, and going to an orthopedic doctor, that I had no cartilage in the first place. I paid for a service that I did not get, now I have to go the total knee replacement route. You can do business with Arrowhead, but you can't say that you weren't told about this company.
5 My Physicians Assistant Tiffany is amazing !! She used to assist Doctor Izad but now assists Dr . Sinai . Tiffany is very sweet personable and attentive she always makes me feel comfortable even I. The most uncomfortable situations and she's always quick on her feet
4 Our family has been going here for years. Changes have been made, providers have come and gone. However the level of care is consistent. I see Neerja Sethi N.P.. I like that I can get my blood drawn there, and reach the staff thru the NextMD portal if need be. Sometimes it is hard to get anyone on the phone, wait times can be long. Leave a msg and they do call back when they say they will. Evenings and Saturday appts are very generous, as most practices do not offer this. Thank you Gilbert Center!
5 Spend a great deal of time with me very thorough I did not feel rushed but when he's caring for other individuals that seems reasonable also provide an email address for follow up if I have more questions which I probably will. Gave a complete diagnose reviewed all medical records concurred with other doctors and individuals great confidence with this doctor.
5 Dr Petrick and Dr Robey are AMAZING! My body was in pain post partum and they both helped me get realigned. Best part that they both do adjustments on babies. That was something I never knew. It definitely helps with fussiness and gas on my 4 month old. She is a much happier baby after her adjustments and it helps her sleep better as well.
5 This office is amazing! I went to another Chiropractor before seeing them about back pain, hip pain and numbness in my hands and none of my problems were fixed. After seeing Dr. Turner and Dr. Rudd for a couple months I am pain free! I would recommend this office to anyone that is looking for pain relief and good genuine Doctors. Also I get a massage every week from Auden and he does a great job and I always feel amazing after leaving!
1 OK, so I'm still having payment issues with this place--now my insurance company is questionning it.   They billed for the physical which was part of my plan and shouldn't have been a charge.  Then they added a separate charge for an office visit without letting me know that would cause me to incurr charges.  SMH.  This might be technically legit, but it is definitely not patient friendly.
1 Do Not Go Here! They four pointed my and another young man. They retaliate and behave as if this was The State Mental Facility. The culture in this ER is not therapeutic. You will not get help, just mistreatment. The only thing I would recommend is the food. Let this speak for its self.
5 I had strep and my toddler was battling a stomach flu. Yes, it took a while...but it's a small place and there were 4 families in the waiting area and who knows how many in the back. It pains me to see reviews regarding the wait. It seems that when we are being seen we expect full attention and a thorough review of our symptoms, while receiving compassionate care - but we forget this while we aren't on the receiving end and out in the waiting room. Let me say that we received better care by this doctor than all the doctors we have had in Surprise. The nurse was efficient. The doctor himself was patient and playful with my son, while getting the exam done. Then it was my turn and he was very kind regarding my dilemma and illness. He explained things and asked questions. He was genuinely concerned.
1 I went here after I had a serious fall and direct blow to my elbow. The emergency room referred me to the Core Institute with a possible fracture. When I went in for my appointment, the X-ray tech was very rude and unwilling to help me by explaining how he wanted me to twist my arm for the scans. When I asked if I had it correct, he seemed very aggravated. While in the exam room, a very nice nurse cut my splint off and offered me a pillow to prop up my arm. That was about the greatest ounce of courtesy I received. When the doctor came in, she seemed very confused as to why I was there. She said she saw no fracture and to make a follow up appointment for 2 weeks, but my elbow would probably be fine by then and I would probably end up canceling it. Rude! She also had her PA look at the X-ray and he made a comment about how he could zoom into the X-ray as much as he could and maybe find a little scuff on the bone that probably wasn't from the fall. They offered me more pain killers but warned me of how addictive they are and to only take them if I was in pain. Really I felt totally blown off and like my pain wasn't real.  Fast forward to two weeks later, I kept my appointment I had made but I went to see a different doctor at the Core. I was in the exam room for maybe 2 minutes. The doctor glanced at my elbow X-ray and told me to start physical therapy. He didn't look at my elbow, feel it, or even ask anything about it. At least with this visit I felt like I got somewhere: physical therapy.   I didn't do my physical therapy with the Core, but was planning on going back for another reevaluation due to my continuing elbow pain and issues (silly to go back, I know). I ended up going to see a different doctor not at the Core and I didn't have my X-rays from the Core with me so they had to take new ones....guess what! A fracture! Plain as day! Right where the emergency room said it was! I feel like I have totally wasted my time and money at the Core. I also feel that it has really put me back in where I should be in the healing process because I was made to feel like what I was feeling was no big deal or "normal." And this is 3 months later!  Never would I recommend going to the Core!
5 Great classes, lovely facilities and friendly staff!  I've been to a couple of gyms in Toronto and I have to say, energyXchange is by far my favourite.  They have a unique offering of classes. My first class was "Joga," which is yoga for athletes and I've been hooked ever since. I even bought Jana's DVD workout. I liked that it was more challenging than typical yoga and is a great compliment for any sport/fitness program you're on. I've tried other group classes and have enjoyed them all. Instructors are supportive and helpful.  The space, although small, is built really well and professional. And CLEAN! It's a pet peeve of mine when gyms offer a barefoot environment but their floors look dirty. energyXchange is not like that all. I also like that they stock up with high quality products like Aveda and DavidsTea. And it's really nice of them to provide hair ties in the washroom because I always forget.  I live in the 'burbs but this gym is worth commuting for and there is a Green P right on Broadview/Queen that makes things easier.   Not going to lie, it is a bit pricier. However, I believe you get what you pay for here at energyXchange. Membership is not an option for me so I just buy packages of classes or the unlimited month pass.  I have been to energyXchange since 2011 thanks to FabFind. They also offer other services in their wellness clinic but I only go for the classes.
1 My wife cancelled an appointment within reasonable time and they sent her to collections over a $50 cancellation fee.  Really!  She wasn't planning on going back anyway because of the staff.
5 I have been treated by Dr Robey two times and after each of those visits I had the most restful sleep I could possibly get!! According to my sleep tracker I didnt move for hours when I ususally move 12+ times a night and lose out on about 30min to an hour of deep sleep. It truly feels great to wake up refreshed. I have also seen Dr Oku about some shoulder pain that I experience from being at a computer all day long. Both Dr Oku and Dr Robey treated my shoulder with ART (Active Release Technique) and even tho it was a tiny bit uncomfortable to get the treatment, I could move my shoulder and arm with no pain afterwards. So it is definitely worth it. I will continue to receive my treatment here and only here!! There is a newer location on Flamingo and El Capitan That's where I ususally go.
5 I have had multiple experiences with 4 or 5 different PTs and only had mediocre results at best.  I am an avid athlete and I am very hard on my body.  Recently while training for the Crossfit games, I suffered a grade 2 torn hamstring.  I spent 8 weeks in another unnamed Rehab facility and yet again was still struggling to get any muscle recovery that was shorter than 2 or 3 days and was experiencing what felt like muscular binding.  I met wit Dr Nestlerode at Enterprise Fitness and it is hands down the best thing I have ever done for my rehabilitation needs.  In 1, one hour session he was able to help me relieve tension that I had been trying to relieve for 8 weeks from my hamstring.  I gained about 20 degrees of flexion in my hamstring after one session.  Absolutely awesome guy, very knowledgeable and passionate about what he does clearly not trying to get rich at the expense of his patients!  I have had 2 more sessions since and will be having another within the next week.  I cant for him to start his wellness program so I can go monthly just to stay on top of my body!  Do your self a favor and go see this guy if you have any issues that need to be addressed! The best in this area ten fold! Thanks Dr.
5 I'm a patient of Dr. Leslie Denton. I go to the office in Seven Hills. Dr. Leslie is the best. Sites patient. SHE LISTENS! When was the last time your Dr did that? ;-) The staff here is wonderful as well. I am always treated with respect :)
5 I have been going to Dr.Baumbick for twenty five years now and I would never have known what to do with out him. He is the best in the business. I always feel so much better after I get my back an neck adjusted. My back was so messed up an now I really feel great my spine is straight now, and I feel great the best chiropractor ever. I do want to add that the whole crew has always been nice to me very nice I never have to wait even when it's packed. I will always go there. This is the place to go if you are in pain believe it. Dr. Baumbick is the best.
5 I can't begin to describe the amazing employees that work at Athleticare. From the time you walk in from the time you leave you are well taken care of . Morgan Crum (the PT) has rehabed my daughter who is a soccer player four times, my husband three times, and myself at least two times . He is extremely knowledgeable about sports injuries, as well as common injuries . He always does what is in the best interest of his patients. The location is right off the freeway and there is never an issue with insurance as Roseanne is very competent and will gather any and all information you need . Alexa his assistant is always friendly and eager to help you in any way possible . I must say I drive an hour to get there and an hour to get home and I wouldn't have it any other way. That is how much I trust everyone at Athleticare !
1 The only reason this gets one star is because the front office girl was nice and understanding and yelp doesn't allow zero.  I called this place to get an evaluation done and to start therapy after I broke my finger and it was the closest location to my house.  After I initially called they couldn't get me in for three days which is fine, they're a busy practice; my appointment was set for Friday at 3pm.  I work in the West Valley, 20 miles away from this location, after I got off work at 2:30pm I called and told them I would be about 15 minutes late due to traffic, they said ok.  I get there right before 3:20 this OT KeOnna Williams, who is supposed to do my evaluation said I was too late and I had to reschedule rudely and walks out to the back room.  I explain I can't take work off since I'm coming from the west valley and leave work at 2:30 and I know how this system works evals don't take long and mine will be quick since I've already been going to physical therapy for my finger (**since desert hand therapy mixed up my insurance benefits in the first place stating I COULDN'T see an OT but only a PT; my insurance company said they never told them that.)  So after explaining this to the front office girl who agreed with me, she goes in the back to try and asks her again if she can just do the eval, she comes back and tells me "she won't do it, I know it doesn't take that long, I'm sorry" in a whisper so the OT doesn't hear.  After that last attempt the OT STILL decided to hide in the back room and chose not tell me to my face that I need to reschedule because of whatever reason/because she had more clients at 4pm.    I work in a school district and work with speech therapists, occupational therapists, and physical therapists all the time they are my coworkers and I know for fact my evaluation wouldn't take an entire hour and "push back her other patients" I rather her have been honest and say "it's Friday, you're late, and I don't feel like doing it." At least that's a reasonable answer for me driving 45 minutes to get to the appointment and losing out on money from leaving work early.  Avoid this therapy place and this OTR at all costs, she is not patient oriented, she doesn't care, she comes across that you're wasting her time.  I'm disappointed in this establishment, don't give this business any of your money I DO NOT recommend this OTR or Desert Hand Therapy to anyone!
5 If you will check two of my previous dental posts, I have not had good luck with dentists in the Valley.  I worked in dentistry many years ago, and am able to evaluate fees, sterile technique and quality work.   Consequently, I am delighted  to write this review. This clinic is excellent in sterile technique, and quality of work performed.  Yes, it does require more time than at a schlock dental office, where you are in and out without attention to sterility and the light handles are not covered, no masks worn etc.  This happened to me twice. The fees are more than fair.  With many transmitted diseases, i.e. HIV, HEPATITIS,A,B,C,D ETC,  the first most important element to notice when you are seated in the dental chair, is to look at the light at the chair to see if the handles are covered.  Gloves the dentist or hygienist wears are of no value if they put their hands in a patients mouth, then adjust the uncovered light, and continue in your mouth.  You will have the saliva, blood, plasma of all the other patients in your mouth.  Thank you Midwestern for your outstanding service to this Valley.
4 Went in for issues swallowing/eating to see Dr. Tesler. Both of us were unsure of what my issues were, but we ran lots of tests and were finally able to come to a conclusion. I appreciate his urgency to get me in and his ability to see the discomfort I'm in and do everything he can to help me. I definitely would recommend him as a GI doctor to anyone who asked. He is both me and mt significant other's doctor and he's always sure to remember us and take the best care of us possible. This office is a little slow, one time I showed up 15 minutes late to an appt. I had and I called first, they said it would be fine and I ended up waiting in the waiting room for over a hour. They definitely can work on their quickness but as for the doctors and medical assistants definitely would recommend.
1 Be ready to wait!  You would think that since it's a private institution it would be more efficient... NOT!  Completely disappointed!
5 Can't say enough good things about them. Daily geadaches and neck pain are a thing of the past and they are really helping my nephew with his Sever's. Eric and Dave are awesome
1 Absolutely Horrible practice. She clearly only cares about getting your copay and submitting the bill to the insurance company. I make an appointment and get siphoned of to her other employees and PA. I don't pay a premium price to visit with a PA. I want to see her. They also like to make me wait for around 45 minutes in the waiting room: Even if it's a first-thing-in-the-morning appointment.  My wife had some ex-rays done on her hip that was causing her excruciating pain. After two weeks she still hasn't heard anything from her. We call about the issue and ask if we need to come in to discuss it or just go get an MRI and still haven't received an answer. She clearly doesn't care about her patients. Only about her bottom line. They like to overbook their appointments at the dismay of us the customers. How can she not reach out to us on such an issue as a debilitating hip.  Her practice started out OK for us but has quickly gone downhill. I will not ever go back to her nor recommend her to anyone else. In fact I've let the entire fire station know about her methods. Unacceptable.
5 Triple Threat Performance is the perfect solution for anybody looking to get in the best physical shape of their lives while having the best technology and therapy methods to heal your body.   I am a CEO in my late 30's and always looking for ways to consistently perform at my peak both physically and mentally. As I get older I still train hard but I get a lot more little tweaks or minor injuries than when I was younger. Before Triple Threat that would sidetrack me, it was hard to stay motivated and my mental state would be negatively affected. Triple Threat's methods to treat and repair my body when it's tweaked on-site immediately right after or before working at the same place is an amazing luxury. This minimizes any time off needed and I'm able to produce more consistent results. It is the best concept to have your gym, trainer, motivator and "healer" in one place.
5 There is no other place I would go, nor recommend, for physical therapy. Ed and Amy, the owners, are on site to work with you to relieve your pain, or rehabilitate post surgery.  I have been a patient for years, for an assortment of ailments, and always feel fantastic after their care. My Scottsdale doctors now send their west side patients to Apex and are very pleased with their patients results.  Visits to Apex are more like a visit with family and friends than a medical appointment.  If you remember the TV show CHEERS, Apex is like tgat5, Everyone knows your name and welcome you on arrival. If you ever need physical therapy APEX is THE place to GO.
1 This used to be my favorite gym when it was Golds. But the staff is incompetent and the facility is lacking. Upon trying to cancel I was told I had to wait for the manager. Who never called me back to cancel contract. Furthermore they make you jump through hoops to cancel anything. Nightmare. Never going back.
5 Dr Tom is awesome! He helped me with 2 separate injuries - my shoulder and knee. In both cases I came in with almost no mobility and left feeling better, and within a treatment or two (literally), I was a new man. Thanks Dr Tom
5 Dr Travis Hailstone is a new doctor at this office. I followed him from his previous location in the northwest to this location in the southwest.  To me, it is worth the drive. He is a very kind caring and compassionate doctor. Try to Google him on ratemds.com or other sites and you will see what I mean. He has rave reviews!
5 I love this physical therapy office! Mandy helped my teenage son who was diagnosed with tendinitis and was struggling while running in track and cross country. They worked with him on exercises that would help him and even showed him how kinesio tape would help him. The staff was so supportive of my son who was struggling with his diagnosis. I will always appreciate the service that they gave my family!
5 The office makes you feel so at home. The staff is very friendly, and the pep smear was so fast I barely noticed!
5 They all amazing here. Helped my step son out a lot! Great service and comfortable environment! Highly recommend
5 Often its hard to find a reliable doctor for chronic pain management, especially when your new to the area. I was fortunate enough to Find Dr. Mastrin. The DEA is very tough on pain doctors so they have to make sure their patients have all the requirements and follow the rules. She has outstanding experience and generally cares about her patients. My quality of life is way more bearable because of her.
1 This is the worst doctors office ever!  It takes over a week to get a refill for any RX,  and this happens every month.  The front office is not efficient, and reaching them by phone is impossible.  All I can say is DONT GO THERE
1 I've been in Physical Therapy on and off for Plantar Fascitis for 8 months.  After my last visit (my 4th to this location), I quit.  I was in so much pain from the ultrasound therapy, which I started intensifying by itself to the point I ripped the boot right off my foot from the pain because they just kept coming and turning it down and it would spike again, that I swore I would not go back.    They told me the machine needed to be calibrated (really? If you know that, FIX IT).  I have never felt so uncared for at a facility designed to make a person (eventually) feel better.    I'm still having residual problems from the intensity of the ultrasound.  My foot and leg will go numb randomly.
5 Dr Robertson is absolutely the best. He's always cheerful and thorough. Yes sometimes the wait time is a little high. However that being said I've ALWAYS been taken right in when there's been an urgent matter.  I was sad to hear that Dr York isn't with the practice but really the only male doctor we need is Dr Robertson  Staff is really friendly and most of the doctors are too....I have never taken kindly to Dr Laura however.  All in all Dr Robertson is 100% worth the wait when there is one.
5 If you are tired of being a number, spending more time in the waiting room or only getting a handful of your concerns addressed, then Turntable is going to rise above and beyond your expectations!   My first visit has me feeling astonished.  I would have gladly paid my copay for this visit since I left with such amazing advice and goals, but I didn't have too.  Why is that you ask ? Because it's free with my Nevada Health Coop!  Say what.?!?!  Yes you read that correctly.  I spent over an hour in the facility, received amazing service and it was free.   Short version: this is unlike any expectations a Dr's office would be.   I was expecting a long wait and a quick visit.  But no....They let you be the driver!  You decide how long your visit will be.  I waited all of 5 minutes and met my health coach first.  I spent a good 30 minutes with her and then my Dr came in and we spent another 30 minutes together.  I have never felt so appreciated before.  I honestly felt like crying.  I wish I could give a higher rating.  Long version:  a 5 minute wait and I met my Health coach.  At Turntable you have a Health coach and a Dr.  My coach was very informative and wanted to know everything I was having concerns with, so I never felt like I could only talk about the "major" thing that was bothering me.  I talked about everything that I had been worried about.  She took my vitals and then went to get the Dr.  My Dr is amazing.  He plugged into a big screen with his laptop and told me I was looking at my own medical records and that we would always have access to them.  He spent the next 30 minutes answering each of my questions and concerns.  We went over my expectations, the items they need from me and what our next steps are.  Then I toured the facility and was informed of healthy cooking classes that are offered, the gym that also has free boot camp and yoga classes.  They also have anxiety/stress relief coaches on site and will even perform lab work on site! I left my visit on cloud 9.  I have never received medical treatment, advice or options with such passion and true honest concern for my well being.   I was given business cards for my Coach, my Dr and a 24 hot line that I could use at anytime.  I can have email conversations directly with the Dr if needed....even video chat!  I am still shocked.  Give Turntable a try....you will not be disappointed!
1 The office is filthy. The air conditioning system they use is leaving the door open and turning on a fan. As a Dr. she is incompetent and rude. I would not recommend her to anyone. The waiting room is about the size of 3 public bathroom stalls, and that may be giving a larger advantage than is accurate. The patient tables in the rooms are filthy. The chairs you are supposed to sit in the waiting room as well as the patient rooms are filthy. The patient tables do not have any type of coverings other than paperwork, empty containers, and dirt. This Dr should be out of business. Her "medical practice" is a disgusting joke. You are better off choosing a different Dr.
4 I love Dr. Whitten, I've been seeing her for several years. I did have one appointment with Dr. Andrews once and found her to have no bedside manner, personality or helpfulness. Choose the correct doctor and I think you'll be pleased.
5 I have been going to Foothills Surprise and want to tell you the staff is superb!  Do to three accidents over a two-year period it has kept me coming back for over two years and they always have the same staff, which leads me to believe they are happy as well.  They evaluate me constantly and change my exercise plan often to keep all my muscles strong.  Jeanne and Clint are awesome, always listening to me and discussing options for my body to get better.  They offer Dry Needle treatment that was a great alternative to constant drug treatments.  Every time my doctors say you need therapy, I say "go to Foothills Sports Medicine" They are the best! Susan Pendleton
5 Leena's beginner's course is perfect for anyone wanting to start yoga.  Other classes I have been to in the past, I felt lost and didn't feel the benefits I was looking for.  With her class you will get individual attention, to make sure you get the most out of your practice.
5 Second day here , great place perfect location.  The employee that work with me are doing great job.  Quiet , there is outside nice Coffe place.  You never wait. The time that you have appointment this time you will get it.  Overall 5 stars.
5 Wrote a previous review in February about my "back injury" misdiagnosis galore that turned out to be a 10 pound dead kidney, thanks to a UPJ obstruction that most likely happened while I was still developing in the womb. Didn't even know about it until this year. Hello, pain!   Sick of being at the mercy of when it would throw its next temper tantrum, sometimes coupled with vomiting, and not being able to throw hammer, my surgeon and I agreed it was time to have that useless sack o' fluid evicted in April.   Turns out even if you don't have an open nephrectomy, you can still lose a lot of abdominal strength. So, back to Spooner Physical Therapy!   Had the pleasure of working with Trevor again - Who else?   I can hear him now if he ever saw this review. "Oh no, Meg?! That lady was one high maintenance pain in my left butt cheek. Never again. Like, ever!"  I sincerely appreciated his willingness to get down to business, creating a solid plan to help rebuild strength so I could train and compete again. Even if he did enjoy "beating up" on my ugly surgical scars with a huge smile on his face.   Of course, if I didn't do my part, I wouldn't be back to throwing right now.   Getting someone functioning again is only half the battle.   Almost everyone I encountered here seemed invested in your recovery beyond your condition. Or they're just pros at faking interest in you as a person and not just another number . . . Which would suck.   When I first came here in January, I was extremely nervous that I'd have another awful PT experience like I did in Colorado. These PTs were some of the most miserable, jaded trolls ever.   None of my concerns were founded at Spooner, really. Was here around fourish months this year, and it was the best PT experience I've had. Not like anyone wants to be here though, yeah?   Still stand by everything said in my previous review.   This has been the hardest year of my life, having two surgeries within an eight month period and losing what would've been my first season back in the ring. Elated to finally slam the door and not look back.   Surely, you're in good hands with whoever you see at SPT.   But they should know that Trevor is a real asset to their team.  Still recommended! And I hope to never see any of these people again in a rehab capacity.
5 I have seen chiropractors most of my life. Dr. Paige is one of a kind. He focuses on the total health of his patients. In addition, he is informative and caring.  I have emailed him when I have been in pain and responds back with helpful advice. Once I referred a friend in pain to him on a Sunday. I gave my friend Dr. Paige's email address, and Dr. Paige responded back with advice the same day. My friend saw him the following day and Dr. Paige worked his magic.
1 I'm only giving this location one star because it doesn't give me the option not to. Michelle Jordan was the was the most narcissistic, egotistical, and patronizing person I ever encountered in my 25 years of living. When I asked for a simple update as to the long wait time she was very rude & told me that there were people at the location "having heart attacks". If someone was having a heart attack why was she at the nurses station gossiping and not helping the patient? & If she hadn't called an ambulance to transport the patient she has bad judgement. I wouldn't let that incompetent individual touch me with a q tip let along treat me. The whole UMC brand as a whole is disgusting. I've been calling trying to speak with someone directly regarding my issue and I've just been transferred and transferred. If I lived across the street from a UMC facility I would rather die then to have anyone working for them assist me!
5 I've had a lot of physical therapy expeiences in my life, and this is a really good place to go for help.  I really WANT to be strong again, and Dr. Rikki Lewis and her staff work well with me teaching me what I can do to achieve this goal AND maintain my wellness on my own!  Their technique is not complicated nor based on dozens of expensive, intimidating "machines", but rather uses props that are available at sporting goods suppliers, and "hands-on" massage and treatments.  The atmosphere is up-beat, warm, friendly and personal.  The patient population varies in ages, abilities and conditions.  Never have I felt rushed or uncared for.  It is my choice to return here even though my physician has his own PT department in his practice!  I have always had good results here!
5 There isn't enough I can say about Dr. Patty David and her staff. I started seeing her because of my constant lower back pain. She, and her staff, made me feel safe and cared for. I love how organized the staff was. Even when there were a few different therapy patients in at the same time, I never felt forgotten or ignored.  Patty taught me exercises to help with the pain and answered any and all of my many questions. I actually looked forward to going to therapy each week.  I couldn't remember a time when I didn't have back pain and radiating pain. I have dealt with it for about 10 years. Now I can say that I have gone days without the constant pain, something I never thought would happen. I am so grateful for Patty and everyone at Healthsource for helping me on the path to getting healthy.  R.Sagal
1 I was extremely disappointed with the services I received at the Travel Vaccine Clinic. From unhelpful reception, to unknowledgeable and pointless consultations, over-priced vaccine costs and money-grabbing opportunities that were very clear to me (astronomical charge for consultation that was essentially a google search done in front of me; cost to get your record). I will not return.
5 I have been going here for a few years and Dr. Dom is one of the best chiropractors I have seen and trust me, I have seen at least 20, just to find the right one. He is passionate about what he does and really cares about his patients. Adjustments are only a small part of his plan of care,  strengthening exercises, stretches and different types of therapy are also performed during the visit. He truly wants his patients to feel better and takes the time to educate about what he is doing and why! Thanks DR. DOM!!!!
5 Just want to say thanks to Global chiropractic for there great service and treatment plans. Not only has DR.Steven help me with a back pains he's also helps me with weight loss and getting back in shape. I enjoy the friendly environment and the positive motivation I get when I'm there
2 My work needed me to schedule a physical with my primary doctor which was Dr. Carl Ferguson at this place.   Dr. Ferguson has been great but his staff is useless.   They re-booked my appointment twice and when I finally got in they did not have me on their list for that day and would not see me.    I expect a LOT better from the medical field.  I now have a new PCP.
1 Front desk schedulers told me one thing and the office manager another very unprofessional  Lies to cover there mistakes and very poor customer service. Filed a grievance with my insurance company on misconduct. Because my schedule is hectic and I had to cancel a few times still doesn't give them a right to discharge me then lie about it... if you're not on a leave or not able to work (available when they are) do not come here. they are not very accommodating.
5 They got me in within 4 minutes of checking in. Everyone was really friendly and professional. The doctor explained everything to me and really listened to my concerns. The facility is nice and really clean. I would highly recommend this urgent care clinic. They are able to run several tests in the facility itself which is nice considering a lot of Vegas requires you to go elsewhere for tests.  Best facility in Las Vegas area.
5 I headed out to BStreet after Paul moved there from Annex RMT and was genuinely pleased with the experience. It's a great location just across the street from the subway and in the event that I ever need any real hardcore physio there is what appears to be a micro hospital just upstairs!  Regarding Paul, I'm someone with an office job, a fair amount airplane travel, and not much need for any specific therapy and he's been very responsive to my rather handwavy, "I dunno, just looking to loosen up my shoulders?" style of guidance. He finds and fixes previously unknown pain points, is a great conversationalist (if you're like me and can never shut-up), and just as importantly, he's the first male massage therapist I've been to where I genuinely relax.  All in all, 100% would customer again.
5 Great gyno visit - go see Michelle Cairns - she's amazing!! She is one of the best OB/GYN practitioners I have met. She sealed the deal for me. She was kind and informative and patiently answered all my questions.  I loved my interaction with the nurses and was impressed with Clinic 24's technology.    Weird decor - they should fire their decorator IMO... It was very distracting. But the staff is attentive, professional and courteous, so you can overlook the busy fabric coverings that are everywhere.   I'll be back again and will look into some of the other services Clinic 24 has, they seem to be a one stop shop.
5 The staff at this location is knowledgeable and knows how to do an excellent job of individually pacing the therapy. Lisa is a miracle worker. I became a true believer in the benefits of physical therapy.  Everyone at this office made me feel welcome and couldn't do enough to meet my needs.  I highly recommend this office.
5 In dire need of Chiropractic assistance, I checked my insurance, and Performance came up. I ended up seeing Dr. Wes Pope.  The folks there are so friendly and professional.  The facility is clean and state of the art.  Dr. Pope is accommodating, professional, personable, and seems to genuinely care about his patients.  I have been many times now, and every time I leave with relief and a sense of comfort knowing that I am being taken care of by excellent professionals in a comfortable environment.  Can't really say enough good things about Performance Rehab and Dr. Pope!!!
1 My son needed a sports physical.  They advertise low cost quick physicals.  It was low cost $25.  However it was anything but quick, they called 2 people who were here after us ahead of us. I asked the guy at the front desk, he goes back to check, comes out and tells me "I'm sorry, I dont know why they shuffled things around, but I put your stuff on top so you should be next." We waited for over an hour to be seen.  From entrance to exit it was exactly 2 hours and 11 minutes.  Terrible service.  But the oddest thing, the guy at the front desk had his girlfriend sitting at the desk with him.  She was sitting there eating nuts and drinking a tea while chatting him up.  Was curious if he heard of HIPAA laws.  Didn't think about this facet, because at first I was blown away by the lack of professionalism of it, until I had to sit in the waiting room watching them hug and sweet talk until she left.  There is a lot of personal information shared at the front desk of urgent care and it shocks me that no other employee called him out on this.
5 Dr. Rikki Lewis and the staff at Total Sports Therapy have developed  a professional, knowledgeable, and welcoming atmosphere for clients needing many types of the therapy.   The individual attention and care is outstanding and hard to find elsewhere. Rikki has set high standards for the employees and each one of them has risen to these standards.   You won't ever want to cancel your appointments at Total Sports Therapy because you'll know how great you feel while you complete your therapy and when you finish.  Be sure to make your next appointment for your favorite time, before you leave.  Enjoy feeling better and watching yourself improve.
4 I love this clinic. I'm so glad they were accepting new patients when I was looking.  My doctor is friendly and thorough. I rarely have to wait long. The nursing staff is wonderful too. Only frustration is doctor's hours, limited to work hours, which is difficult for people who work mon-fri, but many clinics are like that. Highly recommend AHC.
5 Went here for an earache, called prior and was told there was no wait.  Arrived about 5:30 pm on a Thursday and only 1 other person in waiting area which was clean, very nice furniture with a huge flat screen.  Waited no more than 10 minutes before being called to examination room.  The staff and Dr. Johnson were great especially the nurse who cleaned the wax out of my ears.  I have insurance so no co-pay.  I was out of there in an hour.  I don't have a general practicioner so I will definitely come here again if I get sick
1 This is probably thee worst medical facility I have ever experienced in my whole 30years on earth. I wish I could give this no stars.  No exaggeration.  The front office staff are beyond unprofessional & rude (they thought it would be a good idea to hang up on me more than once, more than twice). After I reached out to the office manager (twice because the first time she didn't return my voicemail) and threatened to contact the chairman, there seems to have been minor attitude adjustments.   Tragic story how I even came to be under the care of this place... I went into urgent care last year (a completely different location) and was assigned a PCP who Im assuming practices out of this office, whom I have never seen & cannot see because she isn't taking new patients  (makes perfect sense).   I called back in April to schedule a physical & was told that MY doctor, the doctor someone from THEIR staff assigned me to, would not see me, bc she doesn't see new patients. When I asked for an explanation, I was transferred without notice and ultimately hung up on. I was LIVID, so of course I left a msg on the office managers VM & expected a prompt response. Never heard from her.   Fast forward a few months. I twisted my knee & called to schedule an appointment. I called, was hung up on (unintentionally I believe), called back, was met with more attitude, after the woman wanted to schedule me for two weeks out from the date (umm no.) and then hung up on again. Called back, this time I spoke with a gentleman. He was able to schedule me and forward me to management (again).  This time she actually returned my call & after airing my grievances, she came to the conclusion that I was upset about the appointment date. Not the case, your incompetent staff are the reason for my frustration (how she missed that i have no clue)   I scheduled my appointment on a Tuesday for the upcoming Thursday.... TWO HOURS before my scheduled appointment time, I was called by an attending physician with instructions to go have x-rays done. WHO DOES THAT?! I go to the office, pick up the referral, and head to 1 of the 2 suggested radiology locations... 2.5hour wait. I go to the second location, they don't even take my insurance...   I go back to the office to see the MD with no xrays... visit goes moderately smoothly & I am referred to get an MRI for which they have to get approval. I was told I should hear from the front office in a few days and if not to call back.   A week goes by, of course I dont hear from them, so I call back. Saaaame attitude having front office lady informs me that the referral lady called 10days ago. I have NO voicemail, No missed calls from the date and time. Nothing. Her response "well it says right here that she called so..." (It took ALL my strength not to read this woman the riot act)   My mom is a nurse practitioner. I did medical scheduling for 3 years, for a major hospital. I have been surrounded by medical professionals my whole life. And I can tell you these medical assistants in this office are THEE EPITOME of "let me go be a medical assistant bc they make a lot of money." They don't care about the patients & their managers are letting this behavior slide. The reputation of this place is terrible (I had a little chat with the lady at the second radiology place).   After my knee situation is situated, I plan to change physicians/offices. But in the meantime ill keep you all updated on their shenanigans.
5 Couldn't be happier with the service and treatment I've received thus far. I was in an accident back in January and had a horrible experience with a previous chiropractor. Since switching, the whole staff has renewed my faith in chiropractic care and how someone should be treated. Dr. Bikram and Dr. Jordan are awesome; as are Tyler and Anthony who are managing my physical therapy. The staff here as a whole are completely genuine and provide a light at the end of the tunnel with their programs fit for YOU. I highly recommend you give them a try. You can thank me later. Feel free to let them know I sent you.
1 Core Institute sent me a bill for a service that the insurance company has paid for.  I've called, emailed, written certified letters, filed a complaint with the BBB, to no avail.  They admit that I'm due a refund and that it's in process, but I paid them in October 2014, it's August 2015 and they still haven't issued the refund.  Each time I talk to them they say it's in process and they'll try to expedite it.  It's been 10 MONTHS.  I finally received a refund check from the Core Institute on September 12, 2015.
1 Over a 2 hour wait with only 2 patients ahead of me. I wouldn't say this place is very URGENT. I came here in hopes to be in-and-out unlike if I were to have went to the hospital. Fast forward over 2 hours and I'm still here. PLUS, they'll be sending me off site for X-rays. Don't even waste your time.
1 Appointment wait times are usually 1-2  HOURS and then you talk to the doctor for about 5 minutes.  I found a new pain management doctor.    My CORE Institute doctor seems to only push procedures and doesn't have time for questions about anything else.  I feel they did 2 extra Medial Branch Block procedures when they weren't needed.  That left me with a MONTH of extra pain and recovery each time. After the 3rd one he told me it was 'just for insurance purposes'.  WEREN'T THE OTHER 2 TIMES ENOUGH FOR THE SAME INSURANCE COMPANY?  On procedure day you'll feel like an Indy 500 car at a pit stop.  Multiple people rushing and all doing their prep so they can get the next customer in the bed.  If you just want procedures without any other support, this is the place.  If you want a Dr. that will partner with you and offer more than the one thing they specialize in, go somewhere else.
5 My daughter and I decided to try this place out. The owners are really kind and genuine. The business was extremely clean and so nice. I've done hydro: colon therapy a few times and this time was the best. We felt comfortable and was explained everything. If you are looking for a wonderful place to do Hydro colon therapy this place is highly recommended. J.C the owner was so friendly and outgoing. I will definitely be referring all my friends. My daughter is going back again today. I woke up feeling so much better...
5 I had a great visit at the clinic. Jacky is very knowledgeable and patient with patients. He's very consultative in his approach. Definitely recommend this clinic.
5 I hurt my lower back 6 days before I was going on a ski vacation.  All the ibuprofen and babying was not getting rid of the pain.  I was desperate for help and this place was the only place I could get a massage at the last minute.  What a find!  Jessica worked on my lower back for the entire 55 minutes and with her advice, I went home a soaked in Epson salt bath.  By the next day my back was 75% better and by Saturday, I was out skiing.  I will definitely go back.  The front office staff was so polite and the massage was AWESOME! They are also very reasonably priced!
5 Dr. Scott is great for adjustments!   Kristen has the hands of a goddess and Andrew gets the spot every time!  Very attentive staff! Flexible treatment plans and schedules.  The therapists are amazing!   If you're seeking a really good massage or adjustment, look no further.
5 He fixated me up!    I went last week for a back problem and within 2 treatment it was much better!  I think it was the gadgets he has!   He was able to see me and listen to the problem and come up with a treatment  plan!    I would go back to him for any sport issues since he is so near me and he has proven he cars for the clients!  I have even handed his card out to others for then to use him!   Now that I'm think perhaps I should not cause I may find it hard to get my appointment!   Lol
2 Matt my PT for 5 weeks was pretty good at 4 stars, and I would have gladly continued to be treated by him if 360 Physical Therapy wasn't so poor at providing billing information to my insurance company. They literally took over a month to follow thru with simple information requests from USAA.  Turned out to be wonderful for I found Fearon Physical Therapy to be flat out awesome comparatively and billing is entirely smooth, no waiting and no hitches.
5 In October 2016, I had a lumbar laminectomy and I chose to do my physical therapy at FYZICAL SPORTS. I used them 2 years ago for a different problem and had a good experience then, so logically, I returned. My experience this time was even better! I have a 42 year history with rheumatoid arthritis, too, and have had multiple joint surgeries over the years. I have encountered many physical therapy clinics and therapists, but honestly, none like FYZICAL SPORTS and Dr. Jimmy P.  The therapists and assistants at FYZICAL are professional, compassionate, friendly, caring, and several therapists have earned higher degrees. Dr. Jimmy is absolutely awesome. He listened to my concerns and goals and considered my unique limitations related to having rheumatoid arthritis as he put together a plan for me. Just 5 weeks later, after utilizing heat, vibration, passive stretching, and strengthening exercise, my goals have been met. FYZICAL SPORTS offers a comfortable setting, good equipment, and the best therapist (Dr. Jimmy P.) in town. If you need P.T., this is where you want to be.
1 Awesome Trauma Center!  Four stars.  The rest of it is a dump and the nurses are horrid!  If you are critically injured this is the place to be for quality care.  They will save your life.  Great care from Trauma Center staff; attentive, caring, professional, compassionate and thoughtful.  Once transferred, God help the patient without family to micromanage their care!  The rest of the hospital is filthy dump, HIPAA violations abound and nursing staff need to reassess their career choices because they clearly HATE people.  This is a county hospital, so even if you have great insurance (you will be over billed and), you will be turfed in a room with a revolving door of homeless and mentally ill people malingering to get out of the heat. How are you supposed to rest with all that crazy going on?   Mildredful and the rest of the day shift/ mafia that run 3W make it clear they hate you, their jobs and have far better things to do than actually care for patients.  They WILL talk smack about you and everyone else in Tagalog and ignorantly believe you can't understand them.    Educated enough to ask a question or remind them of Drs orders/tests/care that contradict their self-appointed greatness?  They will become so passive aggressive and disgusting you can't get your loved one out of there fast enough.  Yes, really.  3W day shift will leave a full (of poop) portable commode (from another patient in another room) next to your door.  You will have to move it when you get tired of smelling it because they never will.  Disgusting.  Hey, Mildredful, next time we will move your little "present" into the staff break room, OK?  3W day shift will ignore your loved one, and you or other family member will end up bathing them, changing their bed linens, managing their care, ensuring Drs orders are followed and feeding them.  Aren't nurses or CNA's supposed to do that?  Aren't nurses supposed dispense medication (especially narcotics) and treatments?  Then why did the nurse simply hand treatments to a family member and say "take care of it, OK?"  Isn't that illegal?   Housekeeping staff try very hard to keep the place clean, but it is a dump, so they can only do so much.  PRAY and wash your hands like you have OCD so that your family member does not get a secondary infection!  PT, OT, RT staff are helpful, knowledgeable and compassionate, but you will never see them as often as Drs ordered.  They are just too overburdened.  Social workers are helpful, cheerful, professional and caring, but also scarce too.  Bottom line: great trauma center, but the minute your loved one is stable, get them transferred to another hospital STAT!  Review your bill with a microscope because it will be riddled with inaccuracies and overcharges.
5 Went in for an injury around 3pm on a Tuesday afternoon for a Walk-In Clinic appointment. Only took 1 minute to register and I was immediately able to see a Family Doctor. She was super polite and provided great customer service. I would definitely recommend this place if you were sick near the Ryerson Campus and wanted some quick professional medical help.
2 I saw Dr. Bader in the Desert Banner medical office on Southern. I swear that when a physician joins a big health group, they turn into robots caught in the wheels of a bureaucracy. During most of my wellness visit, I was mostly staring at the back of her laptop as she ticked off all the boxes on her screen form. I think I could have done most of what she did at home with an on-line form.   I am looking for medical care from a real person, who shows an interest in me long enough to look away from the screen.
5 What a fantastic place. I tried the 60 minute salt water soak and was absolutely floored.  I have to admit, (I was skeptical at first), but after the experience, I couldn't rave about it more. I actually fell asleep. If you want to feel totally relaxed and stress free, look no further.  I couldn't believe how immaculate this place was.  The owners, Vianca and Chris were so pleasant and accommodating.  They make you feel totally at ease. Can't say enough about it.
4 This review is for the back staff only:   Front staff is still awful but Stephanie, Dr. Jadav's  medical assistant, took the time to get all of the information needed and even worked late to get my prior authorization approved! It's unfortunate though that you have to go through a very frustrating process to even get the back staff involved. That's the only reason I gave 4 stars.  The turn around time took 3 full days. Stephanie was nice and cared 100%, along with being extremely attentive to my situation. Fabulous!
5 I figure after coming here three times, I should probably write a review! Dr. Docasar is absolutely amazing. My spouse and I have been trying to conceive for more than a year, and after he found a doctor he loved, it was time for me to find one, too. I was referred to Haydee by a friend who's mother used to visit her as well, and I couldn't be more happy. Her bedside manner is amazing, all of the nursing assistants are sweethearts, and I especially like when they verify your insurance, that the receptionist brings your information to you. They always call you a few days to confirm or reschedule your appointment, and the office is so beautiful. Gorgeously decorated, with refreshments and pleasing music as well.  During my appointments, Dr. Docasar always gives it to you straight. She tells you how it is, what's she'd recommend and then discusses your thoughts with you. I always leave with a ton of information to help me make more informed decisions, as well as knowing I was taken care of by a woman who truly cares for her patients. She always let's you make the final decision on your care, and advises you against poor choices. I couldn't be happier! I will never go to another doctor, and I recommend Dr. Hayder Docasar to everyone!
5 Such an amazing first time float experience. Really clean and welcoming environment. Will for sure come back any time we're in town.
5 Great place for Tai Chi & Yoga!  It's just been 2 months for me and I can feel the difference in my body...better balance & flexibility.  My golfing buddies have noticed a change in my game too.
1 The Great Referrer Yes, I am naming this office the "Great Referrer."  After having given this place two visits, I'm still stumped at what they do besides tell you to go somewhere else to get treated for ANYTHING!  My last visit was months ago so bare with me and save yourself the long waiting times and co-pays by avoiding this place!  What really irked me about this place was how I was sitting in the room for a half an hour.  Not once did a staff member come and say that hey Dr. Shaw is currently with another patient.  I've heard from other patients as well that it's habitual.  Most people will have no problem waiting longer than usual times if you JUST KEEP US POSTED!   Compounding to this, their technology is Flintstone like!  They do not utilize email for anything that would be useful say like LAB RESULTS.  Knowing this place, they likely just discovered the fax machine last year, in 2014...   Just to summarize, if you enjoy long waits with zero updates, antiquated technology/software, and a Doctor who will basically be a personal Google/WebMD to direct you elsewhere, than this is your place!
1 You stated you worked with my ins for two years?  I am not disputing whether I owed you $$$.  You never sent me a bill or contacted me.  If you had I would have been able to contact my ins and find out what the issue was.  How did you expect to get paid if you don't send a statement???????  Sooooo just skip the bill and send me right to collections??  Very poor service or incompetence.  After not knowing for two years it is too late to resolve with my insurance for a visit that should have been 100% covered.  Instead of excuses why don't you take responsibility as you got your $$$$$$!!!!!
1 DO NOT GO HERE. All these 5 star reviews blow me away. I work for the state and have decent insurance,  Brought my daughter in on a weekend. The receptionist refused to tell me how much they charged for a Dr. visit, only saying "It depends on what you're insurance pays."  After paying the $15 copay, we were seen by a Dr. for less then 2 minutes. We were told she had a throat infection. We went home and received a bill a week later for $400.  It would have been cheaper to take her to UMC Emergency. DO NOT COME HERE! TOTAL SCAM!
4 Waiting iover 45 minutes is annoying, only 1 provider,  however once I was called super fast and efficient
3 I have had pretty decent luck so far with them treating my pain. I am communicative and not accusatory when I go. I understand people are in pain - this puts them in a bad mood, so really, stop and think about the grumps this place sees all day, every day. Be kind, be communicative, if you don't like what's happening - YOU need to take charge of your health and perhaps explain your pain or situation better. Again, I've liked everyone I've encountered, they've been understanding, compassionate and helpful as much as they are able to be. I have had to wait at times, but this place is busy and I understand some peeps may take longer than planned, it happens.
5 Big kudos to this place! Jacky & his staff are great. I went in for a massage initially and told Jacky about my sprained ankle that was misdiagnosed to be in a cast. He really helped me gain a speedy recovery and was very knowledgeable about proper care. Definitely a gem in the downtown core!
5 Dr. Perez is an outstanding general practitioner in multiple ways.  - First, I find him to be an excellent diagnostician. I don't get relapses of illness with his treatment prescribed.  That said, if he doesn't feel medicine will help me, he explains why he won't write a prescription. (I'm glad he prescribes only what I need, not just "something") - He is very personable and he KNOWS who YOU are.  - He asks you questions about what's wrong, and LISTENS to you. - I can tell he genuinely cares about my well being and wants to get me back to good health as quick as possible. - His office is well run. The staff are all friendly and helpful and the waiting area is nicely decorated.  - For all the appointments I've had with him, on all occasions I was taken in on time! They seem to schedule enough time for each patient to be taken care of, without being rushed through.  - Lastly, as an overall experience, I can best relate him and his practice to being like the traditional doctors of the past that know their patients well, treat you with genuine care and make you feel like your health matters to them, because it clearly does.  Do I recommend Dr. Perez as a primary care physician? Absolutely! He was my primary care physician when worked at another clinic (Scottsdale Healthcare) and when he left them to open his own practice, I had my records transferred to his office. I am very pleased and satisfied with the care I get from him and wholeheartedly suggest you consider him if you are searching for a GP for yourself. I know when my children get older, they will be brought to him for medical care as well.
5 From my first day there last year, I have always felt very welcome. Everyone from April at the front desk, to Dr. Jeffrey, to all the wonderful masseuses, you will not be disappointed. They are very accommodating and very prompt with their services. They know me and my husband by name when I walk in the door and I know they do everything they can to get appointments in around my schedule.  I highly recommend Ana and Kim for massages! Both are very personable and knowledgable. I wouldn't go anywhere else!
1 Stay away from this facility.  Went there had discrepancy with what they quoted and what they charged.  ended up working out total owed they then sent it to collections.  collections called and said it was paid in full but Foothills charges their own collection fee over the top of the charge.  Very bad business.
5 Amazing doctors supported by great staff in a wonderful environment. Love their system of next day appointments and fast turnaround for test results.
1 I am so disappointed with this office. I purchased a certificate online for a stone massage. Sounds great, huh? Yeah, I thought so too. Problem is that the advertising on the website offering the certificate didn't state that you had to get the massage on specific days at specific times - all of which are during the standard working hours (M-F, before 5p). I work full time at a doctor's office and have to have appointments in evening for a massage - or a weekend. Which, by the way, they indicated on the website that you had to call for Saturday hours. That's why I purchased the massage - for a Saturday visit. When I called to schedule - AFTER the purchase is made - I'm told they don't have Saturday hours and the last appointment during the week is at 5pm. I don't get off work till 5pm. Okay, I'll give them some credit (that's why there's ONE star) - they made an exception and allowed me to schedule for 5:30pm.   Well, the long and short of it is that the day I'm supposed to go for the massage, I forgot my phone at home. When I called from work to confirm, I was told that because I didn't return their call earlier (which I didn't know they'd even made), my appointment was canceled. CANCELED! I'm so upset!!   But now I figure, if they are that uncaring about my appointment time, then how caring will they be with me?? I'm very, very disappointed and although they said they will refund my money, I'm still upset with how the overall experience has turned out.   I will not attempt to use their service again nor will I recommend them to anyone.  =(
5 I've been coming here since they were on Dobson road near Elliot (probably about 12 years!), and I will never go anywhere else.  I have been seeing Dr. Tamburo since childhood, and he is always willing to answer any questions, or work with you to see that you get the treatment you need.  His #1 nurse, Betsey, is super sweet as well.  It can be difficult to get an appointment, but I guess that's what happens when so many great docs are all in one place =)  Go see Dr. Tamburo - you won't regret it!
4 I have had several massages at this location and have had an amazing experience thus far!  The Massage Therapist takes the time to understand your needs and area of concern and does an amazing job to address those areas.
5 I envy anyone living in Scottsdale that has the opportunity to be treated by Dr. Boothe at Procare! Dr. Boothe was the only chiropractor that I would seek treatment from when he used to be in San Jose. Prior to being treated by Dr. Boothe, I had some bad experiences with other chiropractors; most of them just seemed to do a crack job and always wanted me to come back several times a week. Dr. Boothe focused on treating the areas where I had pain or other problems. He focused on the muscles that contributed to the pain and used techniques such as A.R.T. and Graston. Aside from being a skilled, knowledgable chiropractor, Dr. Boothe is also a really great guy, friendly and genuinely concerned for making people feel better.
1 I couldn't be any more disappointed with my experience here. I needed to find a doctor before I went out of town for a week. So I called around everywhere trying to get an appointment for the following day, none of which worked out. That is, until I called Mountain Park. First of all, the only number online for MP isn't even for the offices themselves.. It connects you with a call center in some other state that takes care of their incoming calls. I had to deal with three different people to finally get an appointment. Even worse, the only thing available was for a branch an hour away. But nevertheless, I went. From what I understand, this particular branch was only built one year ago.. So it's really clean and has been maintained well. I arrived 15 min early and still had to wait another 20 min to be seen. The NP's assistant took me back to take care of all the procedural aspects of the visit (weight, height, etc) and he mentioned that I should only discuss one specific issue with the doctor and set up new appointments for other issues. (I've never heard this before and thought it was ridiculous.. Why would I continue to make appointment after appointment to discuss one symptom at a time -_-). Anyway, I waited another 15 min for what I assumed would be the doctor. It wasn't until she came in that they mentioned she was a NP, but I figured it shouldn't matter all that much. I was frustrated because she seemed to be in a hurry, so I rushed through everything that was wrong. She scheduled blood work, back x-rays, and an ultrasound. Mentioned a couple of prescriptions and left the room.. Then at the end, there weren't any prescriptions on the sheet I was given upon departure. I had to spend another 20 min getting people to go back there and figure out what the deal was. I get to the pharmacy and the prescriptions weren't sent in. Anyway, her assistant called me back today about the blood work. And wouldn't answer me when I asked about what they specifically tested for.. Oblivious of the fact that I'm not a doctor and I don't know what all these acronyms stand for. He ends up mentioning iron & cholesterol. Neither of which served the purpose of my visit. I asked him how we should proceed because my concerns weren't addressed and he wanted to schedule another appointment. For what? For me to talk about what I've already talked about? No thanks. I'll be finding another doctor. Don't go here. It's a waste of time and money
5 Over 3 years ago i hobbled into az body mechanics, hopeless w a diagnosis of "probable Somataform Disorder", (i.e pain is in my head) a confirmed diagnosis of an Immune System Dysfunction, Fibro and Rhematoid Arthritis diagnosis. I was also 50 pounds overweight from steroid medications.  The day I walked in the door dr. Ehren Doty he told me as long as I wanted to get healthy they would never turn me away.  Three years later 50 pounds lighter and glowing with health,just like their new office/studio at City North,he and his wife Stacey Dewolf have proven themselves to be true to their word, with their help and guidance I have utilized all modalities they offer, Chiropractic, Pilates, Myotherapy and Nutritional. I have NEVER felt like I was being sold anything, or pushed into something I wasn't comfortable.  I have my masters degre in nursing and have travelled the country to find someplace that could help and guide me in my desire to regain my health, so I believe that my background may give credence to my claims.  The best gifts come from the mouths of friends and strangers commenting on my physique, some friends have actually asked if I had breast surgery, a tummy tuck and a face lift!!!! Nope, just having my body and psyche worked on at the Body Mechanics!
5 Today was my second visit.  I waited to post a review since it was going to take a couple of sessions to see any results.  I have some issues with tendonitis in my shoulder that physical therapists have trouble treating.  I was looking for friction therapy that helps break up scar tissue because this has been the only thing to actually help me in the past.  I was surprised that many therapists throughout the valley had no clue what I was talking about.  After lots of searching I found Scott.  Scott is very knowledgeable and works very deep.  Although painful, this is what is required to generate healing of the tendon.  I will continue to work with him and I am seeing improvement already.  Strongly suggest his services for those with nagging injuries related to injuries.   Thanks Scott!
1 I am writing this review based on this specific location. I live quite a bit away but due to a "youtube" video I decided to give Dr. Alonge a try. I needed to discuss quite a few things but upon arrival at the office there was no receptionist at the front. When she finally got there I had to do this bubble scan tron. I guess this location is doing a Pilot of this new system. Its terrible and very IMPERSONAL. What is worse is that the Doctor and Medical Assistant were able that way as well.  The Doctor literally didn't look up from his computer once he started imputing things. He didn't ask what I was doing as far as my LIFE he just tried to make a assessment based on this quiz that he didn't even tell me about when half the time I was giving joking responses. He seemed very robotic and definitely wasn't a good fit but that isn't why this place is getting one star because with doctors that happens my issue is with the staff. I literally sat for over thirty minutes waiting to get my labs done without any idea as to who was coming or when. This location has a small one room lab and the lady was nice when she finally arrived but I had to go SEARCHING to be able to find someone to try to locate the lady to get a estimate the medical assistant was no where to be found. Once I was trying to exit after it was all said and done this lady at the exit door REFUSED to let me leave she told me I had to WAIT to check out. I was NEVER planning to come back to this place again nor was I instructed that I needed to see the check out people but guess what? she still gave me a hard time and when I finally did get to the lady I HAD ALREADY SIGNED THE PAPER that they wanted to prove I was here. Overall it was a terrible experience and since I like Health Care Partners Pediatrics I will probably try out another location but overall this was the PITS!
5 I found ActiveForever after a family incident.  I was in a panic and not in a great mood, when I called ActiveForever.  I needed some things for my Father after he took a fall.  I found products on other sites (like one named after a giant river in South America :)) -- but have you tried calling one of those sites to ask for advise -- not going to happen...The staff at ActiveForever was really knowledgable and helped me get some things that helped my Dad get out of bed (by himself), get to the bathroom and take care of business.  I don't what I'd do without those things.  I'm glad they helped me pick out the correct things as I found out that most toilet and bed products are not returnable.  I certainly can understand that!  (YECK!).    They also have some other really unique products.  I ordered a few things as Christmas gifts -- thinga I didn't even know existed until I surfed around the site a bit.  People invent the darndest things.  The only complaint I have is that some items don't have free shipping -- however, when I compared the price with shipping to other sites with free shipping it was still cheaper at ActiveForever.  Apparently they don't gouge you on the price only to give so called "free shipping" - no such thing as a free lunch as they say...
1 The reception service at this location of 'MCI The Doctor's Office' at 200 Bay Street is beyond bad. I like my doctor so I'm still going there but to make an appointment is very time consuming. The long drawn out process where they read out each doctors name to get to the right number to dial is crazy slow and when you finally do get there they may no even answer. Their staff looks totally miserable ( no smiles to be had here) and they are definitely understaffed. Really not a service oriented business. I think the public puts up with them only because they have no choice. I try to make any appointments when I'm there just to avoid their frustrating answering system.
4 Dr Rosenstein is a vet patient thorough Dr. He is very attentive, caring and kind. He thoroughly explains things and is patient with you and understanding. He gives you a thorough understanding of your diagnosis and relays it in terms that you can understand.
5 I had a pinched nerve in my neck and in few short sessions Dana has made a huge difference in my well being. At worst the nerve was compressed so bad that my left arm was completely numb at times and I was fearing that I may get permanent nerve damage. Dana assured me this is not a big problem and totally fixable and she was correct. After just 4 sessions, I feel like I've improved 80-90% from my initial condition.   Earlier I was told elsewhere that my vertebrae in my neck has wear and tear and that the nerve is pinched between the two bones that are grinding. Dana disagreed with this diagnosis and told me that the pinching is caused by soft tissue around the vertebrae being too tight and that my spine seems fine - and she's absolutely right. By loosening up my muscles, I feel completely different already.   I'm not familiar with physiotherapy as this is my first time requiring it but based on my experience I would highly recommend Adelaide Physiotherapy and Dana.
1 The office is horrible! I got to the appointment 15 minutes beforehand to fill out paperwork. Appointment was for my 3 year old. As the time went on, my child was becoming increasingly stir crazy. My child was yelled at three times and I was glared at meanwhile it was 45 minutes before I even got called into the appointment. I asked for my money back and went somewhere else. Do yourself a favor and do the same. Major waste of time.
1 This place sucks!!! I had to request for a sick leave just to keep my appt today at 4 pm. I arrived  15 mins early: I was informed that the NP "was running late".  Was taken to exam room at 4:20, NP came to room at 4:45.  "Late" was an understatement!!! Its totally unacceptable to have a patient wait naked wearing paper vest and paper covering on the bottom!!! Its very uncomfortable!!!! And when I complained to the front desk to cancel my "super duper late" appointment and that I wanted all my registration forms & copies of my driver's license, insurance card back "Deb" rudely rudely said that "its in the shred bin and already scanned in the computer"!!! When I said that its unacceptable to have a patient wait that long all "Deb" said was "without pay"!!! I cannot believe she had the nerve to say that to an upset customer!!! She just aggravated the situation!!! If I can give them zero or even negative rating - I would!!! Avoid this clinic!!! They are rude & cold!!! Unprofessional!!!
5 Thursday, March 9, 2017:  Joshua Baker, D.O.   background:  We are from Illinois and my husband uses the Midwestern Clinic in Downers Grove for dental services.  He has been going there for two years and services rendered have been on point.  Because of travel plans, we made an appt for a thorough eye exam in Glendale.  Our appt was at 830a.  Joshua spent over two and a half hours with my husband and did every test possible.  I was able to sit in on this.  His supervising physician also spent a lot of time with us, and they did dual exams, both looking together, comparing and advising out loud so we knew they were on the same page.  Never did we feel rushed and all questions were answered.  We also were able to get all medical records faxed to Downers Grove and another copy has been mailed to my husband, which we have already received.  I would like to thank both of you kind gentlemen for your professionalism and compassion that we received.  Joshua, you will go far in your profession!  You are kind and indeed have  wonderful customer service skills.  Please let your mom know that she did an awesome job of raising you, and no doubt your seven siblings.  I am sorry that I didn't get the doctor's name who was in the room with us.  I do know his wife is from Iowa and a Cubs fan, though!  In closing, I would just like to thank Midwestern in Glendale for this over the top experience and wish Joshua the best moving forward.
5 I was so very happy to be in this place, it is so beautiful and modern, hahaha some if the lay out is weird but super nice, I came to have my iud removed, and the whole experience was just amazing and so easy! I didnt have to wait hours, and my doctor Sara Taman was the most amazing warm and caring woman. She made me feel so good, I was super nervious since my past experience with the gino, but she made it all better. I love this place and I love my doctor !
4 The staff here could not possibly be nicer. The receptionist, nurses and doctors are all friendly and professional. I arrived about 15 minutes early for my appointment and ended up waiting almost an hour to see the doctor, but once I got settled in the exam room, I was able to ask the nurses and Dr. Yee all the questions I wanted. Yay!  Two downsides: plan to carve out at least two hours of your day because you will have to wait even if you have an appointment. Second: you don't (automatically) receive copies of the forms you sign as a new patient. I hear that other doctors send them via e-mail. Shouldn't that be standard by now?
1 If I could give them 0 stars I would. I am on hold with them as I'm typing this. Tried to book an appointment yesterday but was on hold for 30+ minutes. Trying to book an appointment now and I'm standing strong at 28 minutes on hold. She answered at 13 minutes and immediately put me on hold again. Whenever I go in for appointments I have to wait at least 45 minutes to actually be seen and the doctors are rude and unprofessional. It's definitely time for me to find a new doctor.
5 I was VERY happy with Dr La Tourette and his staff! They are all so friendly and although he is a little old school he knows his stuff! I'm so glad I was able to see him and experience my pain relief quickly! Definitely recommend him and his office!
4 Been to this office a handful of times. My Mom sees Dr Kumar. He's kind & listens to both of us which is nice. Sometimes you have Dr that won't listen to one & it's just not helpful. So it's nice to have someone who can hear the patient & caregiver equally. The staff is knowledgeable & helps from start to finish. My only complaint is the phone system for Core is ALWAYS a long wait because it's centralized vs going directly to the office. Which I'm sure helps the in office staff stay on task without having to field calls all day but not too great for the patient. I'd recommend Dr Kumar for neurology & the Core institute as well.
1 STOP! Don't even think about going here. Why? Unprofessional and rude office manager insulted me right from the beginning. Then, Doctor Dean was supposed to see me for a simple tennis elbow treatment that should have been handled correctly the first time, but it wasn't. I payed $300+ dollars the first visit and after I saw NO results from it, I asked to see the Doctor Dean as a follow up. When I got there, Patti, rudely states... Ok, its going to be $85 to see the doctor again. I said, What? I paid over $300 last visit and got no results and now you want more money??? For What? Then the unprofessional and rude office manager chimes in and stares me down and curtly says... "We're not going to give away our services for free!" Then I say... Free???, I paid you over $300 for the first visit and now you rudely taunt me and suggest that I was looking for a freebie? You gotta be kidding me... That was not cool and uncalled for. So, medium story long... There are better offices in town to go to where the staff will treat you better and not insult you after they take your money... And, BTW, I still have the elbow condition, and this shows that the doctor didn't treat me correctly either! STAY AWAY!
5 I switched to this physical therapy office and am really glad I did.  I have long-term injuries that resurfaced in my pelvis and low back.  Pam did thorough evaluations of my injuries and has followed up on my progress every visit.  She is detailed, thorough, and caring.  She does targeted manual therapy every visit, answers any questions I have, teaches me useful exercises to do at home, and discusses ideas for how I can alter the way I sit in my car or at my desk.  She also is trained in pelvic floor injuries/disorders.  She and the other PTs treat patients one-on-one, which is crucial.  (Prior to seeing Pam, I tried a different PT office in Tempe.  I was in one large room with 4-6 clients, one or two PT techs, and only one PT, who was rarely the person who first evaluated me.  I spent 1.5 hours a visit doing exercises on my own and applying heat to my back.  It was what you could all a human PT mill.  Avoid that kind of situation.)  Aside from the excellent one-on-one therapy, the staff at the front desk are very friendly and organized.  I will recommend Orthopedic Sports Therapy to all of my family, friends, and colleagues.
5 Have been seeing Dr.Cleary since moving here in 2011. He is kind, caring and will spend as much time with you as you need. He has never rushed me or my family members. He's just amazing.
2 Very unprofessional, high staff turn over.  If your looking for bad service along with the run around you have found the correct place.  Rudeness is to be expected along with students trying to diagnose you.
5 After $2,000 in Chiro, Physiotherapy and massage therapy, I was still in great pain due to an unknown neck injury. Meds and steroid shots were not favoured so I tried this Chiro randomly and now after a year of pain I am 200% back to normal after 6 weeks!  Hours are great, workers are knowledgeable and they are reasonable to anyone in any financial situation.
1 I visited this urgent care in July of 2014 for dehydration.  I was seen by a PA who spoke broken English and did not come off as very knowledgeable.  I asked for a saline IV drip and the PA agreed.  She spent about 20 minutes trying to tap a vein and could not even do that simple task.  At this point I seriously questioned her ability to take proper care of me and decided to leave.  Of course, a month later I was slapped with a $250 bill for the visit even though the I received no care whatsoever.  I would not recommend this urgent care for anything beyond a prescription fill.
5 Been there a couple of times and so far every visit has been a great one. I almost never had to wait to be called in, the staff is friendly. Doctor Meg has always been friendly and helpful with any questions I have had so far. They have a lady from Sonora quest that does the blood work for them and I have to say that lady know's how to do her job perfectly, She has always taken out blood from me with out a problem, almost pain free!! Overall I'm really happy with Coury Family Medicine and will continue to be a patient for a long time.
1 We had alot of problems with this office, and specifically with their billing.  There used to be a girl who worked there, and I called her PIT Bull Dawn.  You could not get past her unless you paid for the vist and if you had insurance she phoned in to your carrier to see what if any co-payment needed to be made.  On my husbands visit, his annual physical was fully covered.  A month later we start to get bills from this office that we owed over $150.  this was ridiclous as the vist was 100% covered, but apparently #1, the office did not submit the billing correctly.  #2, because of their errors in coding items, his blood work bill was denied.  I had tried for months to resolve this problem with no success, until I finally sent them a certified letter stating that if they attempted to report anything to the credit reporting agencies, I would sue them for slander and violations of confidentiality, as any reporting was false, and therefore any of our personal information that would be disclosed would be reason for a law suit.  Needless to say we will never be patients there again.
5 Dr. Dominic is amazing. His practice is holistic and takes into account more than just adjustments. Flexibility and strength are highlighted as being integral components of successful treatment. One strikingly different ideology Dr. Dominic has is that he only treats individuals who are going to improve. He is not here to indefinitely bill your insurance.  I was quite frankly shocked at how adept his adjustments were. After only a few visits I can feel a significant difference.  Hands down: Awesome.  Alright, so that was a very professional sounding review. What I should have written is that Dr. Dom is the bomb diggity.   I go to see Dr. D for an entirely different reason than when I met him. I came to him with an unfortunate list of "BLEH". Everything hurt. Sitting. Sleeping. Standing. Walking. I was a mess (post car accident - damn drivers in New York!)   A few months later I was discharged. I never thought that was possible when I walked in. Honestly. I was seriously thinking old age would great me with a walker before 45. (Not a good look for someone single. Aaanyway.)  I was able to join a gym and regain my mobility in life. (I've dropped a little over 50 lbs since late Oct. '12) I am not the same person I was when I met him. I see him for adjustments from the vigorous workouts I maintain in the gym. I'm a gym buff. Not very good, but I go to the gym.   The thing about Dr. D is that I don't have to tell him what is off anymore. Unless something is shrieking in pain (which, admittedly, would be bad), I lay down. He pokes the fingers of god around my back, hips, and neck. This dude (sorry, doctor d, I call you this sometimes) KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON.  Don't be nervous, he will be able to safely adjust your neck. Give him your trust and you will be a happier person.  Fair Warnings: 1) He will know if you've had drunk sleep (and can fix that) 2) He has a very well defined sense of smell (and can name the scent of a lotion - putting any boyfriend to shame)  Also, and damn him, he's just a nice guy.
4 I was looking for a family doctor in the area and I consider myself lucky to be paired with Dr Kassam, who specializes in women's health which I appreciate!  The clinic is accessible by transit (501 streetcar or replacement bus) and also has underground parking. When I first requested an appointment, I came in for a general meeting which was described to me as a 'meet and greet'. Frankly, this is becoming the norm for most doctors, so people need to just accept that this is a fact of life. I had a similar experience with an up & coming doctor in Ottawa (perhaps this is the new school)? I know some people see it as a cash grab, but frankly, I'd rather give someone the run down about my medical history instead of chancing it.  In my first meeting, Dr Kassam was thorough in her questions with me and we discussed my medical background. She is incredibly attentive, friendly, and motivated. We discussed where I was in my life & what I saw for myself in the future. She ordered a basic blood workup and updates on some shots I was out of date on. The bloodwork was done on the spot in the clinic. I noticed the last time that I went, they are now only scheduling appointments for blood work. I think it was at that appointment that they weighed and measured me, too.  I've only had one referral to another specialist, and Dr. Kassam had cautioned me that it was a difficult place to get into. She did her magic and got me an appointment, with an 8-9 month lead time. I just got an email from the specialist in question providing my appointment slot. Again...hate to say it, but that's kind of the norm in Ontario's medical system. Luckily, my issue can wait.   I've raised multiple concerns during appointments without issue. At my last appointment, I asked for a script refill (no problem) & asked for feedback about some changes I want to make. Dr Kassam was happy to respond to my questions.  Regarding appointments, I've had no issues booking follow up appointments via email, which I find easier because I dislike sitting on the phone. I simply identify myself as a patient of Dr. Kassam's, suggest a date and time, and it's almost always been accommodated.
2 Its 2:00 in the morning. I've been waiting an hour. My daughters friend (22) is in a lot of pain possibly from a UTI or something more serious.   Her mother is out of state and asked us to use this hospital because her insurance is accepted here.   As I wait, I'm reading the reviews. The BAD reviews. The bad reviews definitely outweigh the good. This makes me nervous. I certainly hope they take the reviews seriously and are proactive with change.   I texted my daughter to inform her and to stay vigilant and to text me if things go south.   I find it a bit weird that I'm sitting and wondering if she'll be treated well because of bad reviews.   I'll post another review to update how the visit went.  It's now 3:30. So far my daughter reports that the staff has been nice. Bathrooms smell like urine and there's used needles with blood on it laying on the floor. Can you say OSHA violation?
2 Hilarious that you morons will make a patient wait almost an hour and a half to be seen for something, and if they are 17 minutes late due to traffic you refuse to see them. You aren't patient centered. Don't pretend to care about punctuality.  Also, stop pushing the allergy drops. You care about money. We get it. Just treat your patient and move on. You'd probably get the patients in sooner, too. No wonder you have horrible reviews.
5 This is my 3 time here today 2/13/2017 and I must say I'm going to stay with them since my other dr retired from Caremore my Dr Corona is a very laid back dr not a stuffy suite and tie guy the Staff and the M A's are very nice and friendly if you need a good dr look them up glad I found them
1 I recently visited St Lukes Hospital ER. Something happened that has become very concerning to me . I woke up from my Injury face down on my bed. When I turned over and sat up I noticed two young nurses standing at the foot of my bed performing various chores, when one looked at the other one and commented " I thought he was a wetback." I'm not only traumatized from my accident, but occupied in thought as to what level of care I truly recieved. St Lukes is the closest hospital to my home. But I'd rather drive or go elsewhere, emergency or not.
5 I cannot even begin to say enough good things about AZ Sports Center!  I went in because a friend suggested I see a PT for all of the back pain I'd recently had. I had been going to see a chiropractor on and off for years and I would continue to have back pain (so much so that at my worst I wouldn't be sitting on heat and ice for days because I could barely move). I found this place on yelp and decided to check it out from the great review - so hopefully this helps someone else out!  After my first visit I knew this was something I should have done years ago. I found out that my back problems were mostly caused from a weak core, glutes, and small leg muscles. I spent two months working on strengthening everything and learned all sorts of tips and tricks on daily movements and activity to keep my back safe.   The staff are absolutely wonderful as well! You can definitely tell that Lois and Britt, as well as the rest of the staff love their jobs!   Would definitely recommend this place to anyone and everyone!
5 Dr jenni and EVERYONE at AFC is simply the best. They make each patient feel like a friend, while giving you the best care. My whole family gets adjusted there, including my 10 day old daughter. Love this place
2 I like the doctors if I ever get to see them.  Have been calling for 2 days simply trying to make an appointmet.  15-20 calls...2 messages marked urgent....nothing.  And the wait time has been over 2 hours at times including waiting room & waiting for the doctor once you get back there.  The management and staff at this clinic are just bad bad bad.  To edit:  I still continue to have nothing but trouble, no help, upwards of 20-30 phone calls in a row to simply get someone on the phone. I know better than to leave a message, you get a call back 5% of the time.  Over a month it took to get a phone number referral they forgot to give me at my last appointment.  This office is just so bad, I honestly can't believe they stay in business.  The Cheyenne location is a tad bit better on the office staff side so now I just drive out there as it's the lesser of the two evils.  But I think the fact that they do stay in business is a testament to their Doctors.  I love Courtney, have seen Beverly & just had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Forte.  The Dr.'s really do seem to care & work really hard but they honestly need to fire the entire office staff & rehire people who care about patients & go over procedures such as how to answer a phone & not make customers call 86 times in a row to hopefully catch someone just to cancel an appointment.  Which btw they will charge you for...nice little revenue stream for them since they make canceling an appointment literally about impossible.
1 Dr. McCarthy saw a family member of mine for the first time. The office was flexible in getting my family member in with short notice but a last minute appointment right before lunch. When my family member sustained injuries during an accident she was too fearful to go in for medical treatment on her own until one of our several family members took time off work to assist her in finding a doctor who could get her in quickly and escort her personally. Usually our family sees Dr. Tognacci and he is exceptional but was unavailable. The only appointment offered was with Dr. McCarthy. I cannot say enough to the public to avoid to forewarn them against seeing her  at all costs. She was highly dismissive of my senior citizen family member, her bedside manner was poor, she was condescending at some points. Took a look in my family member's eyes, dismissive when my family pointed out the several scrapes, cuts contusions. I mentioned a possible infection for which the doctor didn't entertain, I mentioned concern over a possible head injury and she stated she would "suggest" an MRI. She mocked my family member implying the accident was her fault for not wearing proper safety equipment and had an "oh well, that's what you get attitude for not protecting your head." She didn't want to hear any of my family member's concerns. Other than an MRI at another facility this doctor was totally useless. In an obvious hurry to get out the door to lunch she whisked us out of the office in such a slick fast food handling style. Never before had I seen any supposed professional act with such careless disregard for my family's concerns. She kept insisting on my family going to Desert Banner and both my family member and I objected to that particular facility as we both had heard highly unfavorable comments about Desert Banner. Nonetheless, true to form this doctor continued to insist in that facility regardless of our vehement objections. We left there terribly dissatisfied. I immediately took my family to a different emergency facility. They determined she had a Staph infection and prescribed a 2000 mg of antibiotic, Prednizone (spelling) for the inflammation, pain medication for pain management, cleaned her wounds, a cat scan for her head injury and checked her out most thoroughly. They looked in her eyes and determined she had contracted Pink Eye, and the rash she complained about on her stomach was treated. Funny Dr. McCarthy missed ALL this. Finally my family received the emergency service she needed to turn her health back around. All my family had asked for was a simple prescription for itchy eyes and Dr. McCarthy claimed well its allergy season so....(I guess get over it was the message.) Dr. McCarthy wouldn't even prescribe eye drops.....our opinion?  careless, incompetent, reckless and most dismissive.  After we left the doctor must have had a guilty conscience as she sicked her staff on to my family member. They called her and harassed her daily to bully her into going in for emergency medical care at Banner Desert Samaritan. My family member told them she didn't go there. They continued to call daily to cover the negligence of the Doctor who should have treated her instead of going to lunch. They don't have to worry-my family has several family members who made sure she got treated by COMPETENT emergency care the very next day after her appointment with DR. McCarthy. DR. McCarthy sucks! She doesn't need to try to cover up for her malfeasance by having her staff harass patients because she would rather eat lunch than treat a patient. She can crap on senior citizens all she wants because if she is lucky-she too will be one soon and hopefully someone mishandles her medical care in the same sloppy manner in which she treated others. Trust this-don't waste  your $$ or co-pay with this one-it will only frustrate you when you turn to another for emergency care after leaving her office.
5 I cannot believe this place has had such dismal reviews!   I got the Groupon to have 3 moles removed. When calling in to make my appointment they got me in within the week. I will say the office is a little hard to find in the plaza it is located in. Better signage would be very helpful. There is the Bellagio Executive Office and then around the corner from there is the actual physicians office. But no big deal. The people at the front desk where a little busy but were kind, professional, and prompt at greeting me and giving me my paperwork. I went back within 5 mins of arriving with an incredibly pleasant  medical assistant who asked thorough questions and explained the procedure and after care very well. The MA asked if it was okay with me that she started my numbing injections, and since I know that MA's provide injections all the time, I was of course okay with that. I did ask her why she asked if it was okay and she explained some patient's want the physician to give the injections. Ummmmm....okay? Why? But I appreciated her thought to ask and make sure it was okay with me.   She left to get the doctor and Dr. Kim came right in within 2 mins. He had a great bedside manner and was very professional. He gave a brief run down of what he was going to do (all the same info the MA already gave) and asked if I had any questions. He definitely put my mind at ease. He got to work and was totally done within 15 mins. Although quick- it didnt feel rushed at all. He reminded me of the aftercare treatment and handed me a card with info on other services they offer and I was out the door. This place is a little far from my home so I was also very pleased that I didnt have to schedule a second appointment after a consultation.  Using Groupon for this kind of stuff can be tricky and I know it has left a bad taste in some peoples mouths- you are getting something cheap and you figure they are going to try to hard sell you on other things while you are there- or treat you like a "cheap" customer-  not at all the case here.    I will also add that I was quoted over $400 at a different doctors office for the exact same procedure that ended up costing me $84 when it was all said and done. The price quoted on Groupon was exactly what I paid and it was easy and excellent service. I will gladly come back to this office if I ever have the need again, and I will absolutely refer my friends here.
4 Pros: Bodgan Pyasta is very knowledgeable about body mechanics, anatomy, and massage therapy.  He took the time to explain and help diagnose my back problems, and provided me with exercises and insights on how address my particular situation.  He has strong hands, and great technique as a RMT.  I highly recommend him for a deep tissue or sports massage. Cons: The man who answers the phone did not address us or make eye contact while he was talking on the telephone when we first got there.  He could have smiled and been a bit more service oriented, after all we are potentially paying customers.  After my very good massage with Bodgan there was a lot of staff related activity at the desk, and I wasn't sure who was running the show anymore.  I was not inclined to book another appointment with the staff at that moment.  A bit more professionalism would have been a good thing.  I'm only going there for Bodgan.  If he went elsewhere, I would go there.
5 After reading through previously posted reviews I have to say I completely disagree with most.  Dr. Barnes and the entire staff have been nothing but kind, sincere and completely professional.  I'm the largest critic of the medical community, we have so many Dr's prescribing medications before having any clue what the actual cause is.  Most Dr's simply take 3-4 minutes and then say "let's try this" .... I'm sorry what!?!   My first session was an hour and she took all that time to get to know me and my lifestyle and everything that could factor into my issues.  Blood work review was an hour.  Food plan was fair although I'm not 100% I know what causes my issues now.   I used to work for a major health store chain (regional director for 5+ years) and there is no doubt the supplements they offer here are better quality and this took a long time for me to consider switching. I wish I did a lot sooner.  Yes they're more expensive but you're paying for what you get.   If you're going here it takes time and a lot of work on your part.  This isn't a prescribe you drugs and quick fix you kind of place.  It's where they actually determine what your core issues are and make lifestyle changes to fix it.    That's what we all should be looking for and I have nothing but positives to say about them.  I highly recommend that if you go to be in the right mindset and you can solve your issues.
5 One of the best Family Physician.Dr. Jordan takes her time and is an excellent clinician. The PA Michelle is excellent.  I highly recommend this group.
5 Dr. Tice and his office staff are AMAZING! Julie and all the nurses have always gone out of their way to help me with my medications. My insurance always wants me to get a 3 month supply of RX's instead of a 1 month supply as well as utilize the mail service program that my insurance prefers. My insurance is always a pain in the butt, however this office does EVERYTHING for me. I haven't had to lift a finger.  Dr. Tice is fabulous! He has helped me in so many ways. Especially when other doctors told me I was crazy or just lazy. He educated me on "why" things I have tried in the past haven't worked and showed me simple techniques to ensure I have success with all my health concerns. It's not very common to find a doctor that is extremely knowledgeable that is also a genuinely CARING person. I would definitely recommend Dr. Tice to everyone I know.
1 I new update On The Pain Center of Arizona Arcadia center I got kicked out from The Pain Center because Judy Miller doesn't like me I will explain how she always says I'm severely depressed I'm not I'm very happy person so I think it was for five times she is seeing me she always came out that I was severely depressed on October 5 830 in the morning a.m. she came in there saying Brian Richards I am no longer prescribing you narcotic analgesics because you're severely depressed I told her no I'm not I have dental problems that keeps my mouth looking happy and I have I infection on my right eye which is infected my primary care doctor knows this His name is Lawrence Kramer which is completely different place than The Pain Center other than that Judy Miller should be fired I was not severely depressed any time I was out The Pain Center she miss diagnosed me I am only there to pick up my pain medicine Levi Porter he was awesome doctor from The Pain Center he was my favorite Dr. Levi Porter but they terminated him and after that Judy  Miller took over and she kicked me out without any narcotics medicine and discharged me I rate The Pain Center of Arizona Arcadia center as being the horrible place I've been there for at least five or six years with no problems no severe depression only Judy Miller said I was severely depressed she's lying I go home I go play with my birds I have fun playing Grandtheft auto five online laughing having fun every day I'm happy now I have to try to find somewhere else to get my pain medication if not I'm going to go through withdrawals I only have enough for until October 15 and then I'm out God please help me thank you Lord Jesus Christ gave me with your love And let the truth be told about me everyone you should watch out from Judy Miller she has just a really hateful look on her face so if you're going to the Arcadia so I asked for somebody different very highly recommend you do not see Judy Miller she will get you no pain medication and you go home very angry like me the end
5 I have been a patient here for over 3 years now. The team is superb and they are my go-to. I've seen Peter and Kearsten who helped fix a major (and complicated) shoulder injury. I'm also a semi regular user of their RMT services. All their services are great. Staff is super friendly and supportive. I've recommended this place to countless friends who have all had good results. Highly recommend Kinetica if you are active and athletic and need a team to support you in your endeavours.
2 Be prepared to be on hold ten minutes every time you call. People who make appointments online are consistently rude and impatient. Once there, staff is generally nice. Doctors are a hit or miss, in so far as "bedside manor" and competency.
1 We have been patients of Dr Talley for just over 6 months. Dr Talley is a nice person and her staff is also nice.... Good review ends here!  It is nearly impossible to get an appointment, expecially a sick visit!! This has been a rough winter for our family, and we are being offered appointments 2 weeks out! We end up in walk in clinics each time.    TWO WEEKS ago, I had terrible migraine headache, called for appointment or to have her call in meds, was told "she will not call in anything" and scheduled appointment for today (again I waited 2 WEEKS for this appointment), migraine went away with no help from Doctor BUT I kept my appointment because i am now sick as a dog (severe congestion and terrible cough).  Went to appointment and waited 57 minutes to see Dr. Talley, I totally understand long waits during high season BUT there was only 1 other person in her office!!  Dr. came in and immediately said "you look awfully sick and miserable", then proceeded to ask about my migraines and wrote a script for future use AND LEFT THE ROOM! I sat in SHOCK for a moment, and then questioned the nurse "is Dr Talley coming back to exam me for being sick" I was quickly told "NO, your appointment was scheduled for migraine headaches. You will need to schedule a sick visit"!!!!!  I was right there in her office, no pile up of patients and was in my room no longer then 5 minutes. NO REASON not to treat me!!  That was the LAST straw! We now will have a new Family Doctor who will actually give us CARE!!
3 The time I spent working out has to be one of the high lights of my day.   I like coming to this EOS location because it's closer to home and because it has the pool, the sauna, and jacuzzi.  It has everything I need, the only thing I can say is a down fall and not because there is something wrong with the Gym, it's because it is so good that every one comes here and it gets super packed.   If it wasn't for that, I would probably give it one more star.   Overall a good gym! I recommend it! Just not when I'm working out! LOL!
5 I was referred to this facility by and friend/patient who reccommended Matt. I needed to rehab my foot/leg and a freak accident, and I met with Matt for my first appointment not really expecting much as my first experience with physical therapy was not the best. This place was exceptional. He took a long time to get my background, discussed realistic expectations and really took the time to make sure I knew what my program would consist of going forward. In the next few weeks, I worked with Matt and Brad who were so great. This place really cares about your health and getting you back on track even better than before. I was most impressed with my appointments lasting approximately 90-120 minutes as opposed to the rushed 30 minute appointments I had at another facility a few years ago. The whole staff is extremely kind and motivating and I highly recommend Endurance to anyone who needs physical therapy.
2 After my first 2 visits to Advanced Pain Management at the 51st Ave location, I am glad our follow-up appointments are at the Surprise location with Dr. C.  Hopefully staff there will be more caring and compassionate about my husband's pain issues.  Staff is very rude including the PA we saw today who would not let me finish a statement without asking a question.  She did not care at all about why we were there and I finally had to call her on it; asked if she was going to let me finish a statement or just keeping interrupting me.  (Was 2 seconds away from walking out of this office).  The kindest person working at this location is the Lab Corp representative.  I will report back after we go see Dr. C. at the Surprise location.  If the trend of uncaring staff continues, we will be changing our pain management physician for sure.  They really treat you as if you are pain pill shopping and not looking for care. I will report back to my fellow Yelpers!!!
5 Whether you are recovering from an injury, trying to prevent one, or want to take your sports performance to the next level the Center for Athletic Performance is the place to be. I couldn't thank Tom and the staff more for their continued care and support. As a competitive endurance athlete who has had five back surgeries due to a cycling accident over the last 4 years years I have spent a lot of time in rehab. with several different physical therapists. I couldn't be more grateful that I have found the Center and have all the faith in Tom and the staff that I will be back competing at a high level again thanks to them.   The difference between the Center and other places is that at the Center everyone truly cares about you and you are not known just for your injury. Whether you are 7 years old or 70 years old, you are treated with the same respect and professionalism. The skill level of the staff is off the charts, and many professional athletes rehab. here for that reason. Everyone's positive attitude has kept me going through the more difficult frustrating moments and the triumphs.   There is no place I would consider or recommend other than the Center For Athletic Performance & Physical Therapy and I plan to stay on with them continuing with performance enhancement following rehab. The Center is truly a place where you can feel at home while rehabbing and training.   Thanks to everyone at the Center!!!
4 I've been going to Anthem Hills Medical Center for a couple years to see Dr. Reddy. He's great very knowledgeable and caring. Always spends a ton of time with me so I never feel rushed. If I call with something more urgent the front desk can usually fit me in the schedule. Really the only area of improvement could be the wait time. There's been a few times where I get called right away but usually I'm waited more than an hour and that's because he will take as much time as the patient needs. Would be nice if someone from the office called to let you know that the doc is behind. Plan on spending a couple hrs here. Definitely call Dr. reddy if you need a primary physician.
1 AVOID Dr. Shafer! Took my Mom who is elderly to Dr. Shafer to look at her hip which has been paining her a lot since having hip surgery. The front office staff, and the person doing x-rays were fantastic! However when  it comes to Dr. Shafer his social skills and lack of empathy astounded me! He was extremely impatient with my elderly mother who has a hard time getting her words out. He often acted annoyed by her asking questions. I felt so bad for my mom. She's up there in age and time is valuable, I feel bad she had to be talked down nd was made to feel like an annoyance by Dr. Shafer. Would give 0 stars if I could. I wouldn't want anybody's mother treated like he did with mine today.
1 So far the front desk girl (blonde) has been incredibly rude!!!!! Unprofessional and unpleasant. Good thing we have been to another location or I'd never return. I work in the medical field and if I or anyone else I work with treated patients this way at first, they'd be fired!!!! Stay tuned for how the rest goes.
1 Dr Anastasi sent me home with severe hip pain and told me to take ibuprofen for 5 days.  If no improvement, I was instructed to call him. I did as instructed and the pain got worse.  I called and Dr Anastasi was out of the office for the whole week.  ( why tell me to call him if he was planning to be out of the office...). I made an appointment to see the PC...I went to the appointment 10 minutes early and waited 30 minutes before leaving without seeing anyone.  I saw Dr McCoy for years.  Dr Anastasi is a wholly inadequate replacement.  The diagnosis was bad.  The treatment was bad.  The office wait time was inexcusable.
5 I had a somewhat embarrassing test to do today and Kristan, my ultrasound technician, put me totally at ease. She explained what she needed to do and was very compassionate and professional.   I was dreading doing this, and SimonMed did a very good job of making it as quick and smooth as possible. From the front office staff to Kristan for my exam, I was totally happy. The facility is nice, clean, and very comfortable. No complaints from me!
5 Dr Zair is very attentive all about healing.I've had about 5 sessions for Acupunture and have seen Awesome results!! Love it.
5 If you have to do physical therapy you might as well use the best people.  Select Therapy (Especially Sean Ellis) is really the best - and Greg Riles is pretty good too.  Rotator Cuff repair therapy isn't pleasant - but these guys minimize the pain while maximizing the gain.  Easy to schedule, flexible with appointment days - can't say too much about how good they are to work with
4 I ve had a successful weight loss experience with Dr's of Green Valley and look forward to even more. They provided suggestions and guidance. I love that they have extended work hours too!
5 My wife got stung by a bee and they were awesome at the hospital Good bedside manors! Thank you life savers!
4 Dr Duenas is a great doctor. He seems to care when I'm there and explains things to where I can understand but the only thing is his staff. One of the girls is rude and and won't even look you in the eye. The other girl is nicer. The waiting time there is horrible!! Was there close to 2 hours!
5 Dr. Shafer is Awesome.  I hurt my shoulder a week ago, no specific injury just started hurting on Wednesday and lost mobility br Friday. I went to the emergency room and was told I may have tear in my rotator cuff, they gave me pain meds, arm sling and said to fillow up with an orthopedist. I checked Yelp saw good reviews for AZ bone and joint, so I called. The front office staff was great, confirmed my insurance was accepted, and told me I would be in great hands with Dr. Shafer.  They were right. At my appointment they took xrays, Dr. Shafer came in and said my bones were good and did a couple of strength tests and said I basically had tendonitis in my shoulder. He asked what I was taking and when I said pain meds, he told me to stop taking them, they are addictive and arent going to help anything. Dr. Shafer said the best thing for inflammation is ibuprofen. He told me I could take more than I was and I should see improvement over the next two weeks.  I increased my advil intake and kept my ice regimine and today (day after my appointment)I can lift my arm over my head. It was nice to have a  Dr.  that really cared about me and getting me better. I would recommend Dr. Shafer to anyone with shoulder pain or injury.
1 They not worth one star . Service is bad . I did't see doctor just assistant . Send me for injection for my hip (no explanation how it works and what will do ) Stay away from this place !!!
5 "I had low back pain for 3 years from a car accident.  During that time I went to chiropractors, physical therapy, orthopedic surgeon, a pain specialist, acupuncturist, massage and stretch therapy with minimal relief.  Within 1 month after one  PRP treatment my pain is down to a zero.  Dr. Cronin did a great job and her treatment was easy.  I wish I would have done it sooner. "  L.H.  Phoenix, AZ
1 This review is for the front office staff only. Long story short, the receptionist verbally insulted me on the phone on 2 separate occasions when I called to schedule an appointment- she kept saying that I had made and skipped out on an appointment - this was not true. Her attitude was nasty and angry for no reason even when I stayed completely calm. Either way, I have never been treated so badly before. I will be contacting the BBB and reaching out to the doctor directly regarding this employee's abusive behavior. I'm shocked that someone could be so nasty to a prospective customer and just another human being period.
1 Don't even consider stepping foot in this circus of a doctors office. First off I'd like to point out that Dr. Wachs is a very caring and helpful Doctor however her front desk staff is atrocious. I have had double insurance my entire life and never had an issue with it. In this office I went in June they collected a co pay and said everything was fine. 2 months later I get a $350 bill stating my insurance  wasn't processed. So I contact my insurance and they told me to have them call I let the front desk know this and she says, "we don't do billing over the phone," I'm not asking you to bill over the phone I'm asking you to correct this issue. She says she'll call in the morning never does I repeat this step at least 3 times and now I'm sent to collections and the guy in the back proceeds to tell me this is my fault and I need to get out. Meanwhile I've had an eye doctor appointment, chiropractor and a dental cleaning and all have been five so who's the problem here? Please don't go here I'll be reporting them to the better business bureau today.
5 I ended up here because I have a pre-existing back/neck condition from a car accident many years ago and every once in awhile it gives me some difficulty.  When it comes to medical treatment I always like to use referrals from friends and family which is how I heard of C A S chiropractic.  And I am so glad I came.  This is the first place where I can get a awesome massage and get my back/neck adjusted and my insurance covers it.  They staff is very friendly and caring and have got me back to normal once again.
5 I have been going to see Dr Dom and Dr Matt for awhile. This place is amazing. It is not your typical chiropractic office where they want to see you on a plan that just incurs costs. They actually care about my wellbeing and have my best interests at heart. The office is clean, the staff is nice and I referred many clients to them over the years and they have the same positive feedback.
5 Always a very pleasant place to walk into. Your greeted and they make sure you a treated with respect. Have been going here for the past 12 years (since 2005) and lastly have been dealing with Kendra Scott; specifically that she has been working with my mom. Kendra, has always treated my mom well and have nothing but great things to say. Lastly, the staff here are amazing. Highly recommend this place.
5 Every mother that I have worked with who has used Tammy either in her capacity as a massage therapist or as a doula, has been incredibly satisfied with her services.  The feedback I get is that she is reliable, professional, personable and exudes confidence in her ability to help them succeed, with either their birth plan or make them feel a whole lot better with her magic skills.   As a lactation consultant, I have seen the results of mothers who have visited with Tammy prenatally so they could feel their best, as well as the tired and sore new mother who is recovering from the hard work of pregnancy and birth.  All mothers feel much better after a massage with Tammy and I highly recommend her services.
1 Dear EOS managers and owners, please listen to your customers' thoughts and wishes about your gym. You have so many unhappy members and it seems as if you don't care. Maybe making the membership so cheap is not a good idea. I joined LVAC and decided on a whim to go back to EOS for a workout. Needless to say, I left after 10 minutes. The women's bathroom stalls smell of urine. Having janitorial services for only part of the morning/afternoon is not sufficient to keep up with the load of this gym. Your cardio equipment in Cardio Theatre is always broken down. Perhaps buy new treadmills or replace the wiring in the wall sockets so they don't blow. Nobody ever comes into the Theatre room to restart the movies. I did not venture any further before leaving, but I am confident cardio equipment upstairs needs help and the weight area is in dire need of love too.
2 Wish I would have read the reviews before I agreed to come here. What a waste of time waiting for the doctor! The computer sign in said he was on time! NOT even close. It's like a huge motor vehicle type process. Check in, get a pager, wait in the enormous waiting room and feel like cattle. The good part was the doctor was very patient and explained my injury well.
5 I came here to see what I can do to get myself to be 100% in mind body and spirit.  People don't believe that we have other things to make us healthy and happy in life.  Tammy gives you an understanding of what this is.  After coming here I felt better with myself and I look forward of learning more.  I recommend people to look outside of your box and check out Tammy.  In this day and age what does it hurt to learn more ways to keep yourself healthy?  Crystals has been used for hundreds of years to heal in many cultures.  To learn about this and it is always good to have an edge.
1 My first experience seeing Dr. Wright and I would recommend finding a different doctor. I feel like he didn't really listen and after a mix up with getting my prescription called in, I was very upset. I had to deal with a migraine without any medication. I requested to have him call me and was told he doesn't call patients. If I'm paying him, he should call me if I request to speak to him.   *****Update***** On 11/10/16 I received a certified letter from Dr. Wright letting me know they will no longer be able to provide me services. I didn't plan on returning and I don't feel this type of retaliation is warranted.
2 I've had two full hip replacements and used  Athletico facilities  to rehab both times.  The PT folks do an ok job of therapy massage and  putting you through a few initial  exercises. However, I did not like the overall therapy system.  An appointment may be for an hour, but you only see a real PT for about 15-20 minutes.  After that you are shown exercises that you do on your own either with your PT watching from a distance while she/he works with another patient or with an assistant who is clearly not well trained.   Since I have encountered some of these exercises when working with  pilates instructors and athleletc trainers I was often surprised by the poor execution of some of the exercises and that these errors were often not corrected by either PT (who was usually busy with the next client), or the assistant (who probably was not schooled as to proper form).   The atmosphere of the facility is also troubling.  Multiple PTs work on their clients on tables spaced around the edge of one large room.  Although it is possible to pull curtains between tables, this does not seem to be the norm.  The open atmosphere not only means that one is privy to conversations on adjacent tables -- and of course, they to yours -- but also  leads to conversations between PTs, across several tables about their latest restaurant experience, planned activities for the weekend, partner problems ....   If you wonder why after the first experience I returned following the second hip surgery, the reasons are simple -- (1) I didn't know that physical therapy could be otherwise, and (2) I was unaware of options, like Mettler. If you are older, like me, could do without the 20something chatter, and want a more professional experience where the focus is on you for your full appointment. try Mettler
5 Who loves going to the Dentist? NOT IT! My pain tolerance is pretty low, as in drama queen status. That's why I haven't been to a dentist in over 2 years. Everyone from work recommended Wonderful Smile so why not? I must admit because of my past experiences, my expectations were pretty low........ So about Wonderful Smile, HOLY COW! They're AMAZING! Everyone that works there is helpful, understanding and extremely kind. Dr. Nguyen walks you through every step. She's observant and gentle. It wasn't like a spa treatment but I was ..... dare I say, "comfortable and relaxed"?
5 I've been going here since September 23,2016. I absolutely love this place and the staff is amazing.
5 Doctor Swenson has been my primary care physician for over ten years now.  He has also treated my wife and grouchy mother-in-law on many occasions.  And yes, even my grouchy mother-in-law liked him.  When she developed diabetes none of the physicians she tried were able to properly stabilize the disease until she started with Dr. Swenson who quickly got things under control.  She was thrilled but still grouchy, haha!  Name the positive traits that you would like to see in your physician, I assure you Doctor Swenson has those traits.  He is absolutely excellent in every way and I highly recommend him.  I'm not a young man, I have been to many doctors in my life so I know a good one when I find one.  Doctor Swenson is a GREAT one!!!
5 I have been coming here for nearly 2 yrs now.  I have used Close PT for my back problems before my surgery and now for my rehabilitation after my surgery.  I actually cheated on them when I first got my surgery done by trying somewhere on the West side closer to my house. I learned that lesson real quick and came back where I belonged.  This place gives you one on one attention, unlike that other place that just sent me to do my exercises on my own. They tailor your exercises and treatments to your pain level. They are caring and professional.  Justin is my physical therapist, and he is awesome. Once he had someone "cover" and it was just not the same.  Lucia and Connie know me by name and always make me feel at home here.  This place is top notch!!! If you have a choice, this is the place you need to steer your insurance company to send you.  As long as I'm in Vegas, and need PT, they will be my choice.
5 He is the very best.  He is conservative.but is kind and knows his stuff and then some.  He found stuff that others passed over.  AWESOME.  10 Star to me.  Thank You Dr Fabito.
5 I just moved back to Charlotte and needed a new chiropractor. I read good reviews online so I thought I'd give him a try. I'm glad I did the staff is amazing. Easy to get in. Had to wait a day to be seen the first time but since then I call same day and I get in with no problem. The chiropractor is so sweet and very knowledgable. He listened to my concerns and is very genuine and caring. I appreciate that in a Doctor. I just wish they were open on the weekends. I usually go after work and they still see me even if I'm a few minutes late (horrible 5pm traffic to blame). I'll be calling Monday to be seen again. Good location. Easy and plenty of parking. No wait. They get you on a massage table before your visit with the chiropractor. He gave me exercises to do and told me things that will help with my back pain.
2 Things use to be great here, they switched doctors and now not so good. There are people there that care unfortunately not the case for the entire practice. They often make you wait long periods of time and fail to follow through as they commit. The urgent care however is still ran by the same doctor and is a saving grace as well as some of the front desk staff.
5 I've been to multiple chiropractors around the valley. With four herniated discs, I was on the search for a doctor that could assist me in avoiding back surgery for the forth time, and I found it here with Dr. Josh! He and his team have a very holistic all-around approach to rehabilitation that does not compare to what I've seen. Strengthening, adjusting, and correcting seem to be his mission and it's working! What I really think makes them stand out from the rest is his out of the office approach to your rehabilitation. He provides you exercises that you could be doing while you're not there to assist speeding up your recovery, which is brilliant! Why not utilize all the time you have to help streamline your process to recovery! His evolving and strategically more difficult physical therapy complement his expertise in chiropractic care, and I couldn't recommend anybody more!
3 If you peruse hot yoga blogs & forums, you'll find posts alluding to the curse of the third year. For sensitive individuals, the third year of exercising in the heat can take a severe toll on the body. Apparently, those people with hypothyroidism, adrenal fatigue, and other endocrine maladies are prime candidates.   The first two years of my practice I emerged from classes feeling energized, victorious and wonderful. Yet this third year I began to feel drained after class. The number of poses in class I attempted started to dwindle, and soon I was having trouble getting out of bed in the mornings. If I made it to class, it took me two days to recover from it. Naturopaths had opined it might be too vigorous a workout for me, but up til then I was too high on endorphins to listen. When my a** started dragging 30 feet behind me, I had to face the fact I was depleted.  Adrenal exhaustion takes a long time to recover from, coupled with it a compromised thyroid and constant problems with dehydration and electrolyte balance. Still, I miss the heat, and the genuine feelings of well-being hot yoga gave me. I hope to return to the sweat at some point, but I wanted to post my cautionary tale to others if you have hormonal issues and Bikram yoga is not giving you the high it should or that it once did. You are not alone.
4 I bought a Groupon back in February 2015 and forgot about it. The expiration date was April 19th and stopped by to redeem it on the 20th as they were closed on Sunday. I met with Danny, freshly moved from Florida in order to teach Kickboxing. I left the Groupon and was told that somebody will call me back.   In September as I haven't heard from anyone, I took my chance and went to the place. I met with Brandon and Gabriella. They were very welcoming and sorry of the incident, they granted me the Groupon and the access to the Academy even though it has expired, kudos guys!  Even though I had the entire month to try it out, I just went for 2 1/2 weeks there as my schedule was different from when I purchased the Groupon so I had to accommodate and moved stuff around.  Gabriella is the instructor. She is also a fighter and participated to the 2012 World Championship No Gi grappling, she is a tough cookie.  The class (kickboxing) is about an hour.  You will start with jump roping as a warm up, then stretching and finally bags with some combos engaging kicks and punches. Gabriella is really nice person and really gives you some good information on how to strike and best position to be to do so.  As stated earlier, my schedule is not quite the same that is used to be at the beginning of the year and now that it is cooling down in Arizona, I have to prepare for race season in order to be able to finish my half and full marathons.  All in all it is a good place to be doing  kickboxing. Everybody is nice and supportive and you get a good work out from it.  Try them out, it's worth the shot.
1 While the doctor is very nice and office girls are nice, when it comes to billing.....WATCH OUT!  They have a different billing department that bills you out of network prices while CIGNA shows that they are in network.  It really seems like a sham to me.  The only reason we caught it, was because my wife is in the benefits department at my work and knows the ins and outs of it.  BE CAREFUL, THEY'LL RAKE YOU ACROSS THE COALS WHEN IT COMES TO PAYMENT!
5 I found this office through yelp when I suffered a knee injury and decided to give it a try since there were great reviews.  The place is small and cozy; definitely a far cry from the PT office I previously visited.  The best part is that you get one-on-one care and guidance from the therapist the entire visit; you're not pawned off on assistants.  Ryan is my therapist and I couldn't be happier.  Not only does he know his stuff,  but he actually makes the visit fun.   I will continue to come here for any other injuries I sustain,  and you should too.
5 Waited to review until my mom was completely discharged about our experience.  This is moms second admission here and this was our first choice for rehab facility from Banner Desert.  My mom was here 6 years ago and had a great experience.  My moms stay was 15 days for rehab and she did so well and exceeded the therapists goals at her age.  My mom had a couple favorite RN, but especially Jillian.  She was extra special to my mother.    When you think of hospitals or "facilities" you think that the food wont be good, however my mom being the most amazing cook and very picky about quality enjoyed all of her meals in the dining room.  The kitchen staff was so friendly and you could see that they enjoyed their jobs and they put passion into their meals.  It didn't go unnoticed.  The facility is especially clean, as clean as it was 6 years ago.   Dr Ramaswamee (sp) was my moms hospitalist physician and he was personable, kind, and reminded us of a gentle giant.  The staff couldn't say enough wonderful things about him as a physician and person.  My overall impression was fantastic.  Having mom away from home was difficult but to be treated with respect, dignity, kindness, and love, we are forever grateful that she is almost back to herself, at the sweet age of 83.  Thank you Healthsouth for all of your staff for making a difference and lasting impression on our family.  i will recommend to all that are seeking a rehab facility.  P.S. The kitchen provides 24hrs complimentary soda, juice, and coffee to all staff and families. Thats more than my healthcare employer does.
5 I love this office. This is my second experience with physical therapy and this ha been an entirely positive experience.  My therapist, Bill (he is a PT), is incredibly knowledgable and kind while making sure he gets the most out of you while you're in the office. He also equips you with the knowledge to work on whatever your problem area is once your therapy has ended.
1 Worst experience i ever ever ever had in my life. Went there for just a simple physical exam on july 2016. The receptionist in front desk checked my insurance and assured me that i am fully covered and don't have to pay anything. Few months later i received a bill from the Lab they work with for $295. I Called the office over 100 times , and i swear i mean over 100 times, and finally Jasmine who was/is billing cordinator at the time re-billed my insurance. However they kept billing my insurance using wrong diagnostic codes and everytime a new rejection from my insurance. I tried contacting the owner of the place "Mina" and her answer was " we are in the process of hiring new staff and noone works at the billing department. This process took literally one year. This office is very unorganized and very un-professional. Just an advice, don't go to this office and do your research before and find another clinic because you can always prevent bad things happening to you.
3 I'm the type not to go a doctor until I'm very sick and they got me in next day. Good first visit with the  PA he's great. Very nice and easy to speak with and an Army Veteran! The MA was funny and welcoming I'll be back and tell other teachers they've got Saturday hours.
5 Very friendly staff, easy to talk to, made me feel comfortable. I look forward to my journey with Family doctors of green valley
5 Stephanie used a completely different routine than my first therapist and it worked great!! Ashley was fun to talk to and very knowledgable. I am so grateful to them both.
3 I've been looking for a Primary Care doctor in Glendale.  I've had issues with physicians not paying attention to me when I'm describing my symptoms and then jumping to conclusions. I went to see Courtney, a PA at Arrowhead.    I got the feeling that she was not hearing what I was saying and didn't make the connection that I think is necessary in a doctor/patient relationship.  This is just my opinion and please don't base your decisions based on my review.  She said I should get X-Rays of my ankle and an ultrasound in my shoulder.  When I left, I got instructions on getting the X-Ray, but nothing on the Ultrasound.  I still haven't had it and got no followup.  I had to call them for my X-Ray result.  Doctors are busy.  I get that, but it seems, in general, they're so concerned about getting onto the next patient before 15 minutes or so, they don't pay attention to what patients are telling them.    The facility was very nice.  The staff was just ok.  I spoke to someone on the phone who called me at work while I was on a conference call.  I asked her to call back but never heard from them again.   I have nothing against Courtney, but I'm looking for more personalized care and a practice with processes that guarantee closure and some form of satisfaction after an appointment.  I was left in limbo on my shoulder problem and I really can't play phone tag.  I'm busy, just like they are.  I need a doctor who will own the problem just as I do in my line of work.
1 Had a family member stay here while recovering from a stroke.  Bad idea!  The facility is beautiful, obviously designed to create a luxurious feel.  The rooms are nice, and the entire facility is very relaxing. The physicians assistant was helpful and thorough, some of the therapists were knowledgable and hard working. Hence the one star.  However, the facility is NOT equipped to handle patients with high needs, and they should not accept care of patients who are not independent. There are NO rails on the beds, a huge safety risk especially for stroke patients. Minimal staff are available to help, and the staff are under-trained and transfer patients to wheelchairs unsafely. If you cannot press a nurse call button, you are basically ignored, and even when you do press a button it takes a very long time to get a response. The call button was even "broken" for a full day.  Needless to say, another family member had to stay most of the day to supervise care.  We had to make sure meals were provided, because if you can't get yourself to the dining hall you don't eat. Vital medications were never given at the same time each day.  If you view the website, you will notice that the staff and board of the organization listed are mostly real estate investors and business people, NOT medical professionals. And it is obvious in the care received. This is a business who cares about profits not patients.   If I was recovering from knee surgery or any other minor surgery, I might stay here.  For any other reason, stay clear!
1 I have had two knee replacements with great success with Dr Duhon. However, today I saw Dr Christopher Huston for back pain. HE IS A JERK. He is combative, condescending and a know-it-all. Not a very good skill set for a doctor. Sadly he is the only back doc at the practice. I will never return to see him. One star because he is breathing.
5 I loved Dr Thompson!!!  She listened no matter how long it took to explain.  But, now she's gone so says  a My Chart message. I wish they could disclose where she's gone. I'd follow her in a heartbeat.
5 Had what THEY call "minor" knee surgery, torn meniscus in three places, and went to therapy here for 6 weeks. Very pleasant, clean atmosphere, and the therapists I have been working with, Nick and Jerrod, have both been helpful, encouraging, and supportive. Its somewhat somber in there, I'd prefer some motivating rock and roll music over the sound system, but that's just me!
5 I have been a patient of Doctor Fereidouni for several years and followed him when Aveon Health was opened. I love Doctor Fereidouni, Kim Brabenz and the entire staff. They treat you as a care partner and are very empowering. Thank you both for taking such good care of me and my family.
5 Dr STaub has been amazing! I have had a herniated disc which just came about in the last week and in a short period of time he has gotten me back on my feet. When you are unable to walk and the talent he has to know how to adjust you and explain in detail whats going on puts you at such great level of comfort. Its a miracle the work he has done in a short period of time to get me feeling better. He has great gift and truly listens and cares about your situation. I would highly recommend Dr. Staub and you wont be disappointed. Greg S
5 Pittsburgh Physical Medical  is a true restoration practice. Dr. Foltz carefully hand picks only the best employees that follow his lead to listen and hear their patients needs and come up with a plan of healing through chiropractic cares, deep tissue massages, and a fitness plan that not only heals you now, but for a life time. I strongly recommend this practice to everyone!
5 I had my first RMT massage ever here with Ellen. Ellen was fantastic and made me feel comfortable and was very knowledgeable. The facility is very tranquil, clean and peaceful.  Ellen went over before starting since it was my first time, what to expect, what areas I thought I needed targeted etc.  When leaving, I got a package of Epsom Salts with Lavender.  I've already booked my next appointment and can't wait to go back.
5 Dr Foltz is amazing! He looks to help you get better and not just treat symptoms. After only a few visits I was back to my old self with the knowledge of how to keep myself from getting hurt again. I hurt my back in the gym and now I'm back in action.
4 My wife's family has been under the care of the professionals at Desert View Family Medicine since it was located at Southern and Val Vista in Mesa.  I've been seeing PA Stacy Schaible for the last 8 years and I must say it has been highly refreshing.  She is kind but very matter of fact.  She is always takes a down to earth view on treating me and my family.  I have seen some of the other doctors in the office and all have been exceptionally good.  They are also usually pretty good about getting me in same day or next day when need arises.
1 Have been here several times and the care provider has been so lackadaisical in their "diagnosis" finally after prescribing me several different "solutions" obviously I was upset that the issue had not been resolved. Trying to get help from the front staff was no better. I guess others have had better luck than me but I definitely don't recommend them.
1 Office is unable to appropriately bill insurance. This seems to be a repeated issue with their facility, as I was waiting for my appointment, I heard the receptionist on the phone dealing with other people clearly having issues of the same type. Interesting to receive an eye test in a dark hallway.  Their solution, to light up the sign with a cellphone!  Seriously?!?!  Plus, not properly marking request for blood work correctly, so had to make a round trip to get the paperwork redone so I could complete my physical. Clearly, as others corroborate, this office has a ton of issues; the main issue for me, being their complete lack of knowledge to properly submit codes to my insurance company-which then goes to a collection agency-special. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THEM AT ALL!!!
4 I've been visiting this salon for a while as I bought an IPL voucher from Groupon. The salon is a lovely place and the staff are very friendly. I've been receiving my IPL treatment for a few months and i've also had my legs waxed here. No complaints about anything :)   The salon is a bit out of town but if you live near by it's perfect.
3 I came to Jackson Physical Therapy because the doctor I really wanted to go to didn't accept my insurance.  I saw one of the doctors there (maybe Jackson??) who was very nice.  The office staff was lovely and got me in very quickly.  I went through all the details of what was going on - it's a laundry list, so the fact that he listened to me and kept asking questions is much to his credit.    He went through a couple physical tests (moving my body around in weird positions and such) and ultimately told me I was fine.  He suggested I do some yoga, but didn't offer any specific advice to help solve the issue.    I left feeling alright about everything, but then realized I should probably get a second opinion.  I went and saw a second physical therapist (the one I was referred to by a friend, who doesn't take my insurance) and had a much more thorough appointment.  That doctor helped me realize that my pelvis was mis-aligned and gave me specific stretches to do that will help.  The team at Jackson is really nice and probably great for people who have had surgery or need rehab from accidents...but wasn't the right doctor for me.
4 there were a few important things i was looking for in a gym upon moving to champaign.  1. it was not filled with u of i students. 2. it had to have the classes i love to take (ie pilates, yoga, spinning etc). 3. it had to be close to my house. 4. it had to be reasonably priced. voila! i found it! it's called the mettler center. it's not your "typical" gym because a majority of what goes on here is physical therapy. so, yeah, i may bring down the average age to about 45, but hey, i love it. similarly, you can get some killer massages here (and 10% off for members. score).  i love working out at this place for many reasons. first, i am not intimidated to use any of the cardio machines/free weights/other machines because there are no overly-muscled, steroid-using men giving me the stink eye. second, because i love the instructors i have for my classes (emily, don and rhonda get specific shoutouts). third, i can go at any time of day and get on any machine that i want to use (all that have tv's up front to tune into). fourth, they have just about anything machine-wise or accessory-wise in a gym you could ever ask for. fifth, they have cooking classes that so far have been quite interesting and useful in expanding my cuisine. sixth, the staff in general are always extremely useful and will help me with anything i need. seventh, well, i could go on but i'll stop the list now... anywho, the only thing i wish differently upon my mettler center is that they have a pool and larger locker rooms...  and i only know the price for a monthly membership, which is $54/month with a $75 joining fee. since i'm in a joint membership, my price is $35/month (boy's is $54). with the membership comes the use of the workout area, free workout classes (with a couple exceptions), discounts on massages and cooking classes, 4 free personal trainer meetings, and again, the list goes on....
5 Good massage. Clean and professional. Private room. Good foot massage also offered. Parking at the back. Renovated house. Overall very satisfied.
1 Dont believe them if they tell you they will verify and get your insurance preauthorized.  We waited 2 weeks for an appointment. When we made the appointment, the lady said they would get pre authorization for our bcbs and call if there were any problems.  We got an appointment confirmation call the day before the appointment and they said everything was good to go.  Took the day off work and drove 25 minutes to fill out paperwork, wait 40 more minutes in the waiting room only to find out that they hadnt done a thing.  They didnt accept our insurance and we were sent away.  We did get a half hearted "sorry" from the lady.  The staff left person information out on the counter while other patients were present.  At least I think they were patients? The staff was hugging and buddying around with one of them.  It was a really bad experience all the way around.
4 The people at pain stop have always been great to me . I highly recommend them , you are not just a number
5 When I started looking into massage schools, I wasn't completely sure I wanted to become a massage therapist. Many of the other schools I found seemed very general and had a broad curriculum, but once I found NCSAB I was sold! This school is designed to equip you with the skills to accurately assess and treat a wide variety of musculoskeletal conditions and provide LASTING pain relief. Regardless of where you want to take your bodywork career, NCSAB is an excellent place to start. A solid foundation in anatomy and biomechanics combined with a top-notch techniques for safe and effective therapy. No regrets here!
5 Thank you Dr. Chris and Dr. Sonja for all that you do.  What a great team who genuinely care about their patients.  From  the moment you walk into the door you're well taken care of ...with a smile as well. They listen to your needs and know right what to do.  Dr. Sonja can also help you with natural  vitamin/mineral Supplements. Her recommendations not only helped myself but my son who had experienced digestive problems for  many years.   Her recommended enzymes helped him in a way no other product ever has. She has enlighten me on how many fillers were in my previous products as well.  I walk in with discomfort and walk out feeling myself again.    Try them and you'll know why they have such a following! I'm glad I did!
4 I went here with a fractured elbow on a Saturday morning and must say that I was rather impressed as far as walk-ins go. The staff were hurried but friendly and the doctor was very thorough. He did everything he could to help before sending me to an ER where I could actually get x-rays read and then called on Monday to follow up. I would definitely go here again if the need arose.
1 My whole family USE to come here. My son been hurt in the WIC office many times because no one watching the kids. They dont really dont check you here. The dr never touched my son. Will have you on hold for 45mins. Also have canceled on me without calling me. So I showed up for nothing. The OB had me in the back undressed for a hour and a half until I dressed myself come out only to be told I was forgotten. (No sorry) My husband got his blood pressure checked 2 days later he gets a call saying he need to get up and run to the ER... Nothing was wrong at least by time we got there... I have tried everything inside the buliding the only nice thing I can say is... The lab calls you back fast.
1 This place is a total dump and the woman who runs it is completely unprofessional.  Had an appointment for the Ionic Spa (basically a foot bath) and a Swedish massage with exfoliation.  My appointment was for 4, and they didn't start the ionic spa until almost 4:30.  Totally ridiculous, seeing as how she literally only had to fill a foot bath with water.  On top of it, she hardly speaks any English (which is fine) but she had the balls to roll her eyes and bitch at me for living in Quebec and not speaking fluent French.  I only just moved here, and my spoken French is admittedly not great, but it wasn't even like I was speaking only English...I had actually tried to speak French the whole time.    After the 30 min. foot soak (which was in a cramped room and I was sitting in a fold-able, very uncomfortable chair), things were already running late, but figured I would get right in to the massage.  I waited another 20 mins.  By this point, I knew I would have to leave early, and truthfully, I don''t even care.  The massage room was barely private.  I could hear EVERYTHING in the reception area, and it smelled bad.   The masseuse came in, and it was a guy.  I was surprised that they hadn't offered me a choice.  I told him that I would have to cut my massage from 1 hour, down to 35 minutes since it was so late, and he didn't even apologize.  I'm soooo glad that it was only 35 mins. I've never had a masseuse touch my butt cheeks or inner thigh without first asking me if it was okay; it wasn't okay.  I did NOT want me to touch me so freely without permission. Totally awkward and uncomfortable.  He kept telling me to relax and enjoy it.  I didn't, to say the least. The owner also abruptly came in, in the middle of the massage, without so much as a knock.    I would NEVER go here again. The owner didn't even ask me why I was leaving early, and since she makes you pay beforehand, I didn't even have the chance to argue about the cost. I honestly got the feeling that it was the kind of place people go to for "happy endings".  Yuck.
1 This place is like a sweatshop slash conveyor belt of staff and patients. Therapist doesn't bother to introduce themselves, the waiting room is overrun with patients. No privacy in the treatment rooms where you can hear every other patient and therapist conversation around you. And don't even think about finding out how much your care might cost because they have their little spin of no answers down pat. Take your time and money elsewhere.
5 Bought a Groupon for a thirty minute feet reflexology and a forty five minute full body massage. The place was clean, professional and my massage therapist offered me some tea as well after the treatment.
1 They lost 11 test results and consultation notes in the span of 6 months. The final one I had faxed over 7 times and for some reason they still claimed they hadn't gotten it. After calling through out the day and standing in the office for more than an hour they finally printed my results and sent me on my way. The next day I recieved a ntice that they would no longer provide me service. As if I would consider going back at that point. Staff was rude, doctor was horribly rude and poorly informed. Frequently pulled up webmd articles during appointments. Its pathetic to think expecting them too receive results in a timely manner was too much for them to handle.
5 I have been going to Dr Fauer for about 5 years now and I think he's great!  He takes the time to actually talk to you about what's going on. He doesn't rush in and do a 2 minute assessment.
1 This office has no idea what they are doing. They were not able to get my primary insurance verified because the insurance office was closed so I paid more than $100 that day to be seen. They told me they would check for eligibility they following day... A few weeks past and I hadn't heard from then so I called on my lunch break, was on a 'brief hold for about 15 minutes and then was told they didn't have my insurance information..... It's all in the tedious new patient paperwork they had me fill out..  I didn't have the info on me so I said I would call back.. Now I call and they say I have to come into the office to give my insurance information. I work in a dental office with insurance and I know how this works. I understand they want a copy of my card. As you can tell I'm a little frustrated. I would have been better off going to an urgent care honestly. I was a new patient and waited about 45 minutes to be seen, and they're office was incredibly hot.. I did see one of the nurse practitioners and she was very nice, but the front office is a nightmare.
5 Dr. Karen Ngo does a very good job. She is knowledgeable, enjoyable to talk with, and provides solid treatment. Most importantly, my back and neck feel better.   I also didn't feel that additional treatment was being pushed on me - a previous clinic I went to suggested a semi-weekly treatment plan for a number of months, which felt closer to a cash grab than anything else.  Plus, $65 for a treatment is very reasonable.
1 I was here last week as a walk-in for a 45min foot reflexology. The space seem clean and big. However the actual massage experience were not good. The technique and skill level are not match to the price. As the lady massaging me, she claim she did not get pay a lot and only make minimum pay and continue to explain that fact of her not getting back pay enough for at least 20min. Then she go in to advise I should get additional service done. Again, explained to me how hard her work is, which is to massage. I try to be polite and switch topics numerous time, but she kept saying "she get pay very little". It was very uncomfortable experiences. Either the owner is not paying there employee adequately or she is trying to handle me for more money. This whole situation came across like a scam!!! I do not recommend this place and find the experience very unprofessional. I would even recommend the place right across the street. At least I know they would deliver a profession without trying to scam me for more service by playing the victim. Something to think about for the hiring manager.
1 please do not go to this incompetent so called clinic!!  took my wife there and was there 3 hours and never seen a doctor just a p.a. that was dumb enough to write her medication that shes allergic to and when the pharmacy called them they got no response!  oh yeah bring plenty of cash even if you have insurance.  they have a problem with getting paid......wonder why
1 My husband and I decided to go there to get a primary care doctor and I chose Patti Timlick who was a joke. She had no concern about any health issues and was unprofessional. She didn't worry about why I was really there and made me come up with a reason she could bill my insurance, couldn't just be a well check up. I will not return there and will not recommend anyone.  My husband saw Dr. Donald Middleton a few weeks later and pretty much had the same experience. Extremely unprofessional. He was told to put his cell phone down as it distracted the doctor and all he simply was doing was inputting notes from the visit into his notepad. He Also questioned my husbands spirituality when his anxiety and stress concerns were brought up. Needless to say we have looked for other PCPs as a result oh this experience.
5 There are not enough great things I can say about this office. Dr. Lundgren is awesome! I have been a faithful patient since 2002 and would not dream of going anywhere else for my chiropractic care. Dr. Lundgren is extremely knowledgeable in many areas of the body not just bones... he looks at the total picture. He listens to his patients and never gives up in finding a solution to your specific problem. He is confident and caring! His team is very helpful, friendly & compassionate. He has had very little change in his staff, even those employees who leave, have come back to work for him again... that says a lot! Whatever your circumstance may be, if you are looking for a well rounded, extraordinary chiropractor, please call Lundgren Chiropractic. He has also just added a pain doctor and has expanded his practice into pain management as well.   After reviewing my review (haha), I realize it sounds like a pitch or that I work for him, but I can assure you that is not the case, I am just a loyal patron who knows a good thing when I find it!
1 NOTE: This was at Dr. Kaplans' previous location on Maryland Blvd. Different office. I haven't been to this, newer, office. He now has a different staff. Good move Doctor! The previous office admin wasn't good enough for you!!  I'm used to waiting in this waiting room for an hour and a half - two hours...Today, I had shown up at 400 for my 415 appointment. At 5:30 someone poked their head in and asked what I was here for. I said my 415 appointment.  I was told that DOCTOR KAPLAN HAD LEFT!!! WTH?!?!  The woman (not the receptionist) asked if I wanted to reschedule...are they high!?!?!? Maybe THEY can afford to keep leaving work early, but I can't.   I've never been treated so rudely as I have in this office  (on every visit, not just this one) and today was the last straw....  Believe in the low ratings this office gets. Customer service they have no clue.. But they know how to take your money..to the point that they always over schedule appointments so you end up sitting there for a very long time. I always knew that a doctors office that makes you sit there (consistantly) for longer than 15 minutes has no idea how to manage an office. I've put up with it one too many times - but that all the receptionists would leave and leave me sitting there while the doctor goes home is totally uncalled for and rude. rude. rude. rude.  Poorly run office. Totally mismanaged.
4 Wow. I can safely say that all the previous negative reviews of this surgery do not chime with my own experiences!  In fact, the reviews here and on Google are so negative that I put off registering for a long time, before eventually I really needed to make an appointment and the other surgeries I live in the area for were full so I ended up at Brunton Place out of necessity (it's also the closest surgery to where I live).  The reception staff have always been polite. I mean, they're not cheery and they're not friendly, but they've never been rude to me (unlike the ones at Leith Walk where I was previously registered). Very frustratingly this is a busy surgery so expect to wait two weeks for an appointment that fits with office hours, but I know that those are limited and they do have cancellations and an urgent clinic at 11am if you're really desperate.  I have also experienced, what reviewers on Google have pointed out, that they can sometimes be pretty bad about answering the phone... but you can always ask them to sign you up to their online booking system if you want.  The other frustrating thing is how difficult it is to register. Forms are only given out on Tuesday, and they go so quickly that unless you're ready and queuing up outside for it to open at 8am, you're probably not going to get a form. Then you have to take it away and return another day, before 4pm.  But apart from those niggles, I've nothing bad to say. I've been here twice for doctors' appointments, once for the health assistant and once for the practice nurse (the last three of these all within a week). I've been seen on time for each one, and the medical staff have all been nothing but friendly and helpful. Granted, I don't have a chronic health condition so I don't usually have cause to be here that often, but as an occasional user I've nothing bad to report.  Don't let the bad reviews put you off!
5 My son is a swimmer and he'd been having some issues with his elbow. The office staff was very kind and helpful. Dr. Billyard was wonderful with my son and made sure he was comfortable. The office was very clean and very state of the art. They even have a pool right there in the office! We were very impressed with all the staff. They really care about their patients and are very knowledgable. We're so happy we found Spectrum Spine and Sport!
5 Dr. Myerthall did my total knee replacement, and I couldn't be happier with the result.  Everyone I dealt with at the Core Institute was incredibly helpful and professional.  I was back golfing in just two months!!
1 I have been a patient with them for over 20 years but they have lost me as a patient/client. They were unwilling to work with me on some minor billing issues and actually sent me to collections instead of sending me the invoices. I will never use this group again and would not recommend them to any of my family or friends. I will find a new physician. Very frustrating and upsetting that their customer service was so terrible.
2 Visited  twice: My boss bought me a hot stone massage. I enjoyed it and the service was good  Second visit I was getting facial and some waxing. I waited atleast 15 to be called in for my appointment. Which was okay unless you are in a hurry. The lady wanted to start with the facial and then do the waxing.  Ummm no thanks.  I would rather not be totally relaxed and then have my hair ripped out.  So we did the waxing first...lower leg, basic bikini, and underarms.  It took 2 hours to finish the waxing.  I am not overly hairy and I am used to this taking maybe 45 minutes.  She went over every spot atleast 3 times.  I was raw by the time I left.  The facial was fine and would have probably returned if I only had the facial but only because I live 2 blocks away. I do not suggest the waxing!
5 Dr. Steve's listening skill really set him apart from many doctors I have seen in the past. As a CNA, I understand how important it is to listen to your patients in order to provide them with the best care possible. When you visit Global Chiropractic you will feel welcome, cared for and receive and individual care plan that works for YOU. Thank you Dr. Steve and your wonderful staff for taking such good care of me! Kandy Jaffe Angelworktherapy.com
1 Horrible experience for my daughter. She is 38 weeks pregnant and not feeling well so she went in and they did a vaginal check and my daughter informed the doctor she was hurting her, the doctor said, "oh sorry, I forgot to take my rings off" The doctor took her ring off and placed the same glove back on her hand and did another check. It was a dirty environment and I am shocked that hospital is still open.
5 Jason's responses, service and best of all his results are quick and effective!   I was in so much pain and he came to my house the same day I contacted him.  My neck was so bad, I already was at the urgent care and ER the day before.  He did some things I have had done in the past, in addition to dry needling and these neuro sticker things I had never had.  He seems to stay on top of the latest advances and integrates treatments for the optimal results.  The quick and kind responses and follow ups are a bonus bonus plus, Effective AND Personable!  Thank you Jason for Helping Me!
5 I started going to Desert Wellness Center and Dr. Ezrre about a year ago. I have nothing but great things to say about Dr. Ezrre. She is one of those few Dr.'s who really take the time to listen to their patients. I would highly recommend Desert Wellness and Dr. Ezrre to anyone.
5 I have been seeing Doctor Scott at modern massage for the last 5 or 6 years. He is a fantastic chiropractor and has really helped me with some of my issues. Also I have been getting therapeutic deep massage for the same amount of time that has also really helped my stress and relieved a lot of the headaches that I can get. I highly recommend Dr Scott and his staff.
5 Great massages! I always am impressed with the high level opf professionalism and hospitality. My go to person here is Lysanne who does a wonderful job at de stressing me. Daniella and Louise are reccomendable too. When you call ask for Annie to take care of you as she always there to help around with your time schedule and books therapist and treatments according to your needs. The spa is extremely well kept, and caters to only a few people at a time which helps express services and provides a cozy environment as well, where you can most definitely escape people in general. Love this spa
5 This is to Dr. Petrick & Miles a lot of credit owed to Dr. Petrick!! He taught me to be a fighter, he showed me I'm capable of more then even I sometimes give myself credit for. It was thinking of his office that gave me the courage to walk away with my head held high! I'm still doing some of the exercise he & Miles taught me. And, I'm doing what you Dr. Jon Petrick taught me to do best which is FIGHT... For myself! Thank You for giving me strength over these past few months!  You see if you are reading this review, I'd like for you to know this I'm about 2,600 miles away & Dr. Petrick still has a weekly if not daily influence on my life. I was with Dr. Petrick for about 3 years, in that time he not only helped get me stronger physically but, also mentally & spiritually.  So to the person who thinks they have tried EVERYTHING & you are still in pain, or to the person on bedrest after a major surgery... This is the place for you & he is the Doctor that will change your life!  It will be painful, especially ART but IT IS & WAS SO WORTH IT!
5 I would like to thank all those at Dynamic Spine and Sport who are coming to my rescue a second time.    Three years ago, these folks helped me successfully recover from rotator cuff surgery after the not-so-skilled physical therapist I had been seeing elsewhere (because he was covered by my insurance plan) failed to rehab my shoulder and left me bordering on having to have frozen shoulder surgery.  DSS staff, most especially Joe Indrieri and Joey Scorza, made sure I received the help I needed and didn't give up until I was 100%.    I'm now recovering from an ankle fracture.  I had been seeing another physical therapist (again because he was covered by my insurance plan) but was not receiving much more than  exercises I could do at home, a cursory calf massage, and ice, none of which were helping me regain my ankle strength and stability.  I returned to DSS a few weeks ago and am already starting to see progress.  These folks know how to handle orthopedic rehab and make sure you are always progressing.  I'd much rather pay out of pocket at DSS and be successful in my my rehab than go somewhere my insurance covers but fails to help me.
5 Dr. Derek Day has been in business's for 15 years check him out on face book. At Anthem Chiropractic
2 I have been going to see Dr. Belsky and her Husband(who uses another name) Dr. Trajillio that she sends you over too for treatment too but they don't act like they are married.  The office is open and cold, the treatment rooms are a metal hard chair and a flat treatment bed.  She usually only would just quickly come in small chat, touch your neck etc. and that was it write you a prescription. It looked like she just rolled out of bed half the time and I did not think she was professional you could here her language with the staff.  The walls were so thin I could hear the entire conversation in the next room.  After multiple visits, they shuffled me over to a nurse, and I was lucky to see my actual doctor again at all. I think to push more patients through the practice.  I got the impression this was a clinic with an appearance of newer office. I think the doctor does not listen to the patient she is in and out of the room.  You wait about 2 hours for 5 min. Hardly seems worth the time.  I have not had the relief they promised and they just seem to be in it for the money.  I would spend your time and money elsewhere to a doctor who actually is interested in getting you better.
5 I've been here twice, and have been impressed by the skill and knowledge of the surgeons.  Dr. Collins has an incredible resume and kindly answered all the questions I had about a knee injury.  Dr. Raia was very quick and straightforward about my treatment options for a hand fracture.  I will return to them for future orthopedic and sports medicine needs.
4 At BackFit's Gilbert location the staff is really friendly. They have comprehensive health care and facilities.  They also offer allergy testing for seasonal and food allergies. And so much more!    Thanks for all the smiles Liz, Robert, Rachel, Steve, Rubin, Dr. Howard, Dr. Vogel, Dr. Krainik, Lee, Vanessa, and all the other great staff.
5 I have had only two adjustments with Dr Marshall in the last week, and today I topped it off with a massage. The massage therapist Dave is absolutely amazing. I have had memberships for years with monthly type facilities. And never had a massage like this. If you're going for Chiropractic and you can, definitely add a massage for the full healing effect. I have extreme pain with sciatica that acts up about every 6 months and usually takes me several visits to recover But after finding dr. Marshall that all changed. I am at about 90% recovered with only two visits and one massage. When I came in three days ago I couldn't even barely sit down on the table or turn myself over he had to help me with every step I took. But today I was up down turn around all with minimal amount of discomfort. Anybody experiencing any kind of pain or discomfort should come and see him. I'm sure he's just as amazing for routine visits as well. So I plan on making it a routine to make sure these kinds of episodes don't happen to me anymore. Everyone is really nice and professional and treats you with respect. Dr. Marshall takes his time with you and makes sure that you are getting the best care by listening and understanding what all of the problems are that you're having. Thank you dr. Marshall and Dave you guys sped up my healing process and got me back on my feet literally.
1 I went to this walk-in clinic instead of the emergency room thinking it would cost less, but I was wrong. A simple hand x-ray and two min consultation from one of thier MDs who told me I had a CADILLAC insurance policy and I should see a specialist. I had to correct him on the spot, I have an HSA and high deductable so I basically pay out of pocket. So they billed my insurance $500 for the service thinking they could charge an inflated rate. My insurance of course passed the bill to me after discounting the bill by half $243.  So after speaking to one of thier billing representatives he said they are willing to charge me a cash payers rate of only $200. So why would you bill my insurance for $500 if it only costs $200 in the first place.  And that my friends is what is wrong with the healthcare scam in this country.   P.S. the specialist did the exact same work x-ray, consultation, and splint for $135!
1 There is a horrible asian lady working in registering patients. She forced me to call my insurance company to send them a fax even though i had my policy, claim and client numbers. i was having a throat infection and barely standing but just because of her arrogant behavior, it took me nearly 1 hour to see the doctor at 9 am.
5 The staff and therapist here are wonderful!  Very careful with your needs and helpful in your time of need!  This is my second round with physical therapy and was very happy that I was able to get back into Jackson and that I was remembered when I went in last week and even though I was worse than my original visit back in January, Cassie took the time and went over everything with me from the last time I was in and the treatments I've had.  This time is going to be a challenge but I am hoping I can get some relief or at the very least a little better than I was on first visit last week
5 Rose is amazing!! When I work I hunch my shoulders a lot and it creates so much tension in my neck, shoulders, and back. Rose massaged the tense areas to help loosen them up before cracking my neck. It all felt great and like a relief. I had absolutely no soreness or any issues after that! She made me feel super calm during the whole experience and talked me through it. Rose is incredible kind and great at what she does!
5 I absolutely love Synergy and shoutout to the Anthem location!!! I got my PT sessions for my shoulders taken care of, and  I am very happy with the kind of attention and service they provided to make sure I got better.  I can't thank them enough... the patience and the amount of time they all spent to help me out.. both the therapists and the whole staff.  They all made me feel like I am part of the Synergy family!  Ben, Scott, Tony and the rest of the Anthem staff...You guys rock!
5 I can't say enough good about Succeed Physical Therapy.  I am under Jim Bodine's care, he is a professional who knows his business well and has an excellent bedside manner.  The rest of the team is outstanding.  Without hesitation I would recommend Succeed!!  Robyn
5 I love Lyons Physical Therapy!  The staff is professional, personable. John Lyons is the best therapist ever. He always spends his time with you to make sure your needs are met. His staff gets 5 stars as well. LYONS PHYSICAL THERAPY ROCKS!   AC
1 Not having a doctor on the east side of town I came to this practice because I had received a referral from someone who has been a patient of Doctor Fischbeck. He was not available so the scheduler set me with Deborah Grischo. I was initially impressed with the flexible schedule and the ability to get me in right away even though I only needed a physical. That excitement quickly wore off when I figured out why. On my first I left feeling rushed and really akward- the doctor barely listened, cut me off mid sentence several times, made some extremely insensitive comments and then tried to "sell" me on why I should make them my primary physician moving forward. I brushed it off as just an off day because everyone else in the office including her MA was very nice. So on my next visit when Deborah was again EXTREMELY RUDE and CONDESCENDING to the point I asked for my co-pay back and asked to leave immediately. It wasn't even about what she couldn't do for but how she treated me, again cutting me off and talking down to me. She quickly handed the MA my file stated to treat me like she never saw me that day, refund my money and then proceeded to make a "shewing" motion with her hand as she told me I could go. I left in total shock. I am not one to leave negative reviews but having worked around healthcare providers for many years whose emphasis is providing excellent patient care and having a GP in the past who was phenomenal (simply located too far away now) I can not imagine why anyone would choose her as their care provider. It is disappointing as the schedule is pretty open and the other staff was polite but those things do not make up for a Doctor who treats their patients so rudely!
4 Knowledgable Doctor. I like the visit wasn't rushed. Been needing answers for a long time now and this place suggested test and explained it. Only issue is they prescribe their own meds from a website. I asked for detail on dosage because I wanted to by simple over the counter iron and never received an answer other than 1pill/day. I asked several times and the same reply 1pill/day. When I replied with options in grams I never received a reply. I will say email replies were quick, but sadly my concern was not addressed :(
5 We could not have been more impressed with Dr. Lederman he was thorough, professional, and compassionate. He answered all of our questions in understandable terms. I would recommend him to anyone. Teri Minkin
5 My first time at RMT studio earlier today. Nice big rooms and chill vibe.  Robyn did a great job. She has good hands and made sure to check in with me to see what I wanted.  I will definitely be back!
2 I moved here from a small town to be able to get "more options for my conditions. After coming here I am realizing that was the worst mistake ever,  and all the progress I have made I am now going backwards. They dropped medication 40% on my first visit with no other alternatives. My doctor assigns tests that he doesn't tell me what results I have,  so I don't know if I am progressing or getting worse. The wait time is long and when you get in I only have 3 minutes to talk while at the same time the doctor is on the computer. The nurse and office staff are nice and professional in my experience.  Now my doctor has ordered a "electrical response"  test and I have a pacemaker. I am now scared if I get hurt. I am going to see if I can go somewhere else, I just wish I was meet halfway. Sad to hear that I am not the only one who is having problems.
5 so when can physical therapy correct the mind as well as body?  At Beyond Limitations, the focus is on both, and it truly works. I had a nagging injury from working on computers for the last 9 years, (as I write this I feel pain) Lately it has gotten worse, so my doctor recommended PT. In doing so I just happen to stumble upon Beyond Limitations as it takes my insurance. All I can say is Brenda (sole owner and proprietor) knows her PT!  She is certified and highly trained in many techniques. She also has a great understanding of the physiology of the body, and the over powering ability of the mind to effect our body.  The PT we do is a mix of massage, stretching, resistance work, ultrasound, and a lot of pressure based movements. Overall I leave feeling great, and very relaxed. It is cool to have someone to work with that is motivational, understanding, and focuses time on her patients. She is a private owner, and will spend the time with her patients individually. There is no sense of a clock ticking, it seems as if Brenda works to schedule so she has additional time with you if needed. Now I haven't gotten a bill yet from my insurance, but there is a co-pay, and she seems to know how to work with the insurance companies to make it painless when you get that final bill. I know how complex insurance can be, and how they fight every last medical treatment to make a profit. However, Brenda seems to know how to play "the game". Her prices are great, and her service is superb. The location is clean, easy to get to, and inviting. I think if anyone asked me about PT, I would recommend Beyond Limitations without a doubt. It is just a superb place to go for physical therapy.
5 I have been going to Advanced Back and Neck care for many years. The office is very professional.  I've had adjustments, PT and massage therapy and have been very happy with all of their services.  The facility is clean and very nice, the staff is excellent to work with, I never have to wait more than a couple of minutes.  Everyone is warm and friendly. It's a great place.
5 Got a massage done by Dave, it was a recently purchased Groupon, and well worth my money. Dave was professional and extremely great at the massage! I felt better instantly after getting off the table and I fully intend to go back and see the actual chiropractor for a session (as I'm always having problems with my back and neck) and I will definitely be back for  another massage.
1 I went in for a visit and it was apparent Dr Sutter did not look at my chart. He tried telling me i was a type 2 diabetic which is not correct. i am a type 1 and have been since i was young, even on my discharge paperwork the dx is type 2.
5 I came here after my achilles tendon torn injury. Went there for 3-4 months, and it was super helpful. Art was my therapist, he was always super nice and ready to answer any of my questions. Not just him, everyone there was nice.   It made my recovery that much easier with positive energy.
5 I've been seeing Dr. Gothelf for over 24 years with chronic medical issues for myself and my family. While I don't think anyone is perfect Desert Family Medicine is about as close as it gets. I've also met Dr. V and Ginger L and think they're both fantastic too.  Our medical issues have caused my husband and I to see a multitude of doctors over the years  and Dr. G is the BEST. Not every office policy has been convenient for us but having been treating much worse elsewhere, I pray that Dr. G never, ever retires.
5 I am very pleased with the treatment I am receiving here. The Dr. and staff are always friendly and very accommodating to my varying work schedule. They take the time to explain all the treatments and answer all the questions I have about my pain. I would highly recommend Great Choice Chiropractic.
5 I recently changed to Dr. Harter as my Primary Dr.  She spends time and listens to my questions and concerns. She is very knowledgeable and I appreciate the time she spends with me. I am super happy I found her!  Everyone on the staff I have interacted with has also been kind and takes time to make sure I leave with the information I need.
5 I was worried about coming here after the Yelp reviews but it was next door to work and I thought I'd give it a shot. Yes, the wait is long but they take the time with you once your back. I also didn't seem to have any trouble with the staff at the desk. Everyone seemed really patient and nice. As far as the wait, just bring something to do while you are waiting! I'll wait around for a good doctor.
5 Great Service! Highly recommended. I had my foot and body massage at the same time and the service was great and professional! The store is very nice and it has parking at the rear. Close to TTC as well.
5 Dr. Reed is amazing! His services are very reasonably priced, although you cannot put a price on feeling great! Meghan at the desk is awesome and knows everyone by name! This is the best chiropractic treatment I've had and I've been to many chiropractors in my life. I highly recommend going to see Dr. Reed for pain or as part of a wellness plan.
1 Our favorite doctor has moved on .... the office now request a $35 fee for paperwork to be filled out. Front office is slow to respond. Waited over 1.5 hours to be seen with an appointment. Things are not what they used to be anymore. I miss the way this office used to be.
4 A well run professional health care facility. Michelle gave a fantastic massage.  I left loosened up and discomfort free
2 Dr. Adams is a wonderful doctor.  She is extremely caring, attentive and knowledgeable.  If this review were just for her adequacy as a physician, I would have given her 5 stars. Carly, Dr. Adams' admin, is also a joy to speak with.  She goes above and beyond her call of duty and will to try to help you in every way possible.    The two main points that deserve a negative (yes, extremely subpar) rating are:  1. The wait time.  I'm not sure how her staff books her patients; however, I have never had to wait any less than an hour for any of my SCHEDULED appointments.  I once had an appointment at 9:30 and did not get called back for my vitals until 11:40...absolutely ridiculous.  2. Her nurse, Yolanda.  Let me preface this by saying that I am an RN.  I fully understand just how hectic and chaotic a busy physician's office can get at times.  Yolanda has an extremely poor attitude...I'm honestly shocked as to why she ever considered employment in the medical field.  Yolanda is rude, uncaring/unsympathetic and lazy.  I am on various medications, so I have to come into contact with this "nurse" a great deal and every single time, she is extremely rude and uncaring.  It is to the point where as much as I love Dr. Adams, I am considering switching primary care physicians due to Yolanda.  As I stated earlier, if this review were just for Dr. Adams herself, I would give her a 5-star rating; however the wait time and her nurse Yolanda really bring her practice down.
1 Omg... What a poor example of healthcare. Ultimate failure. I moved here recently and needed to get in for an appt. Most doctors were booked out for 3 months or more so I reluctantly scheduled here. I should have known the fact they could get me in right away was a clear sign I was at the wrong place! Everything single thing about the visit was subpar including the doctor. I'll never ever return and I caution you to keep looking for another place for your health care needs as well!
1 Awful office. The doctor we saw, Dr Tresa, was fantastic. I have no complaints about her. She was very observant and noticed an issue needing to be seen by a specialist- this was a very early catch. Great job doctor!  The office though, ugh. We waited 45 min to be seen, and another 45 min for well child shots. Outrageous. I'm usually in and out for a well child in 45 min. They technically separate children in the waiting room for well/sick but everyone enters the same vitals room so that makes division pointless.  I should had stopped there but figured maybe they just had some emergency that day that took a long time. Mind you no one apologized for the insane wait.  I had gotten a referral to a specialist that didn't take my insurance and I called the office for a new referral. I called 3 times, left 2 voicemails and ended up going through scheduling and demanding to talk to the referral. Then she didn't want to relieve I had been denied and was hesitant to give me another referral. And the referral she did give she didn't even know where it was to.  The last straw was they called me the morning of the appointment to tell me they no longer take my insurance and would I pay cash instead? I cancelled and told them they'd lost my business.  The doctors may be great, but considering you have to deal with the office I'd say fun another place.
5 This review is for my mom.  I had problems with my back, neck, feet, and vertigo. I went to Balance Solutions and was treated by Kelly and Christine. I was there for seven sessions and had great results. My neck, back, and feet are significantly better and have less pain. I'm able to walk better as a result. Overall, highly recommended.
4 Dr. Daliah Wachs is so sweet. Her staff is now pretty good. They used to be a little lacking in the staff department, but it seems to be fixed now. Dr. Wachs though is just awesome. She's a great listener and a problem solver. She really does seem to care about her patients.
2 The staff is very nice, and they seem to know what they are doing. The only complaint that I have so far, is that sanitation does not seem to be a big deal here. I went to a different PT for a back injury last year, and there anytime that anyone used any of the equipment (beds, mats, machines, etc.) there was a staff member there to wipe it down with disinfectant prior to another patient using it, also any towels that were used for exercises were put into a used bin for laundry. This place however I have not seen one person disinfect any equipment and they reuse towels on different patients. I am by no means a cleaning nazi, but I recently underwent surgery, which is why I am in PT, and now have open wounds with stitches, which I keep covered thankfully, but needless to say not everyone does, which means there is God knows what on some of the equipment, and just like gyms there is a concern of fungus or bacteria growing on things, which could infect even the cleanest of patients. Unfortunately due to my situation I may not be able to change PT, but am looking into it. The staff's friendly and caring attitude is the only positive, and the only reason this place is getting any stars.
4 I love coming to one medical group! The people are always very friendly and the atmosphere is clean and relaxing. I have seen several different doctors they all have been great but I just don't feel like I have found my go to doctor yet but I have plenty to choose from at all different times. I love the ease of scheduling and flexibility. My only issues is finding the Scottsdale fashion location was and still is impossible. The receptionist I talked to was not very helpful and I couldn't get extra time to find the location to make my appt (EXTREMELY frustrating). I suggest going to the Arcadia location.
1 Wen't to my appointment with DR. Dietzgen becouse I was experiencing some pain due to arthritis and frozen sholder. I was given a referral for a specialist a Pain Medical rehab DR.. After 3 visits with the specialist I found out  that  they were not in network. I called Dietzgen's office to find one that was in network. After several calls being told that it was not thier responsabilty it was the Specialist's. I call them and we go back and forth no one wants to take responsibility. I then call my insurance they say that the PCP is responsible,so I call her office again meanwhile this has taken 3 day's,numerous calls and I am in pain and in need of treatment . While I was waiting to hear back from DR.Dietzgen I found on my own a DR-Specialist in network,I notified DR. Dietzgen and she refused to write a referral, that also needed to come from the Specialist that I was seeing that was out of network. Again back and forth between them she finnaly just said she was done with the situation and sent the referal I feel that DR. Dietzgen didn't care about my situation.and didn't do her job correctly. I will no longer use thier services
1 I would never come here if i didn't have to by my employer. You need to wait 3hrs for a urine drug screen and physical exam! The doctor was super nice but the service is awful! The lady in the lobby even asked me "do you wanna do it or not?!" After I asked if I need to wait another hour because I found out that they didn't do my UDS when my paper specifically says i need it. Service sucks! Team members are mean and not efficient!! 1 star because the doctor was great but everybody else was horrible! Im an RN and would never want a patient to wait that long! Urgent care not so urgent!
5 Always happy with how quick and easy the doctors office is, in & out.My prescriptions prescribed via email sometimes, they trouble shoot most issues over the phone and have saved me $930 eye car savings by calling them and getting good deals on an eye exam. Submitting my prescriptions online to get glasses and contacts. I have noticed a few issues with paperwork and prescriptions when I pick them up but if you take the time to address it, it's taken care of!!!
1 This place is awful for numerous reasons. The most annoying thing: Dr. Saha and her MA DO NOT return phone calls. EVER. I had to reach out to them regarding three separate questions. The first two issues, I requested contact back only once but received nothing. This last issue, I have requested contact FOUR times and have still not received anything back (48 hours later... The office said it can take 24-48 hours for a response and still nothing). I called back yesterday and spoke to the person who takes messages and asked "what do I need to do to get contact back? Because they NEVER return my messages." She said she would prioritize my message... still nothing. So I called again today--- they promised AGAIN me I would get a call back but now have to wait another 24-48 hours. Something tells me I won't get that call back.  Dr. Saha does not know her vaccination schedules and that is super worrisome. She really doesn't know them; they had to Google answers when I was there, and then they changed their minds later when I showed up for an appointment... So I was sent away after making a trip there. What a joke.  I have shown up twice now for two different appointments and had to leave either because the Dr. doesn't know her vaccination schedules or because scheduling has a hard time doing their job. The scheduling thing- I called to try to fix in advance, and guess what! No return call. So I showed up and had to leave because they got it wrong.  Front office workers are really hit and miss. I went to check in and the receptionist made sure to let me know I was interrupting her. "Hi, I'm here to check in." "Oh, I was kind of in the middle of scanning this..." OH I'M SORRY.  Definitely finding a new Dr. I do not understand how these healthcare workers can treat humans like trash?
5 I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised. I was a walk in patient and was in and out in about 3 hours. They really took the time to understand my issues. All of the ladies here were very nice. No issues at all.
5 I hurt my shoulder and was so upset,  as I could not function in my every day life without pain.  It was even painful to find a position to sleep. I also was very frustrated because I couldn't participate in my favorite activity -- yoga!  My doctor sent me to physical therapy and I found foothills sports medicine by the biltmore.   From the minute I entered the office, I was greeted with smiles and great energy from the front desk. I cannot say enough about how much my physical therapist helped me. The entire staff is filled with positive energy and made actually look forward to my physical therapy sessions. My therapist  immediately gave me peace of mind that we would work together to get me back to my functional level. Between the hands-on Manual care I received and the progressive exercise program .... I am so grateful to him for bringing me to a pain free and active level again!!!
1 AWEFUL! I love my primary Barbara Hoose, but I will nvr come back here. Charged my card on file without my permission which caused me to overdraft. Lost my medical records after they even called to confirm, and staff was extremely rude! They are just money hungry and even asked me to re draw all the labs I already paid for because they lost my original ones. Disgusted!
1 I wouldn't go here if I was about to die. We have to many options to tolerate bad service. I was placed on hold to make an appointment and then I was on hold so long it put me back to the main system. Then after almost 10 mins I finally get through and the lady is rude to me. I finally just said to her that I'd like to cancel and find a new dr. I also asked who I could file a complaint with, she laughed and said Yelp. So here it is!
5 Good experience here. In and out in 1 hour 25 minutes on a Tuesday early afternoon. Dr Drumm listens and is knowledgable and compassionate. Reception was a little slow to acknowledge my arrival but that was the only ding.
1 Our experience with Dr. Darzev, found her rude, arrogant and condescending.  Totally unprofessional.  Not only did she possess a nasty attitude, but it honestly didn't seem like she was familiar with practicing medicine.  When patients need to instruct the Dr. to check a child's spine during a routine annual check-up, something is not right.  We were rushed through the entire process and I have never been so upset by a doctor in my entire life.    To compliment this poor service, the Dr's assistant's had no clue why we were even there, despite the fact we scheduled an annual physical exam.  It was like the entire office had just opened that day.  Absolutely unprofessional. Although her office is in a convenient Summerlin location, driving a little further down the road is well worth the health of your family.  I could go on and on, but my job is done.............you have been warned.
2 Location is convenient and the place is clean. The wait time is awful! I waited an 75 min to be seen by someone. Albeit, I didn't have an appointment,  but I was pretty sure that I was at a walk-in clinic. The nurse was really pleasant and easy to talk to. This is a growing practice that is fairly new. However, I can go to faster medical centers in the neighborhood. Maybe more doctors working at one time would help!
1 Forced to go to this place for an annual check up due to my insurance. I didn't check the reviews first which I guess was my first mistake. For the record, I went to the Baseline location which is not located in yelp. I went to this office twice. The first time was a check up and the second was because the doctor who saw me left the practice and their policy is that you must see a current doctor in order to have an active prescription from them. So in other words, just because you get a prescription from them, you may need to go back to them within a year's period if that doctor leaves. And apparently their retention is not great. They ended up charging me $80 just to have a prescription with a zero refill added back in. I confirmed with three other doctors in the area and a typical prescription of this type should be good for 1 year before an actual new visit is needed. This clinic/practice is more interested in getting a little more money than the care of their patients. I get health care isn't great nowadays, but if you get a choice, READ THE REVIEWS and try to avoid this place.
4 This is the location where I see Dr. Constantia Abarikwu, MD. There are two sides to this facility the Internal Medicine side where I visit and the Saguaro Family Practice Clinic. I like this office and I enjoy Dr. Abarikwu and usually there is no problem getting in to see her and the wait time is not painful. Parking here is also a breeze, I like the fact that there is a lab on the premises.
5 After a new chiropractor sprained my neck, causing it to hurt with even the slightest turn, I knew I needed someone experienced, not a newbie right out of school thinking they are the best thing since sliced bread. Jim's reputation is well deserved. I can turn my neck without hurting after 3 weeks, 3 sessions with him.  Great value and great result. He is the therapist to see when you are in pain.
5 This is what a physiotherapy clinic should be.  The atmosphere is congenial, the space is ample, and the equipment up to date.  Most important, the staff is top notch in every way.  One gets the impression that although there are obviously other patients there, you are the only one that matters at that moment.  The attitude is very friendly. At the holiday season. they adopted a family for which patients and staff were invited to buy gifts.  Occasionally, some patients brought in cookies. and everyone is welcomed as if they were part of the Physiotherapy  family.  The staff really knows their stuff , and during my visits, I heard several people express appreciation for good results.  I highly recommend this Dunlap facility.
5 I would recommend AZ Chiropractic to everyone. I had a big crash on a mountain bike and was dealing with shoulder pain for months. I went and saw Dr. Tim Hirst and he was able to get rid of the paid. He even gave me some streches and moves I could do at home to keep the pain away. Clean building and very nice employees.
1 Please,  if you really need a good doctor and have sincere medical concerns, do not even waste your time with this doctor! I visited her for my first appointment about a week ago for a long list of health problems I have been having to live with and need help with getting treatment since the I got pregnant with my son a year and a half ago but couldn't be helped in pregnancy due to restrictions of exercise and drugs. I present her with a long list, which she just sat down and repeated uhuh, ok, uhuh  My biggest problems are the day to day pain I live in due to many spinal problems, injuries, knee issues and injuries (I have really bad joints) and also my hypothyroidism. She didn't even do anything for me as requested for my pain which was to go to physical therapy and pain management after getting updated mri's and xrays,  and only ordered a partial lab for my thyroid even though I've had it for 7 years (..apparently she wanted a baseline reading to see if I even have it, which I've had for years diagnosed by specialists in the endocrinology field) All other things I brought up to her, I could've cared less about, if she had actually paid attention to immediate problems! She also ordered unnecessary tests to be done like a chest xray (no problems there and nothing explained to me of why it was ordered) I called the office right after my appointment and spoke to her nurse about what I needed to get done. Her response "no problem, she will get in touch with you tomorrow" tomorrow came, and nothing. So today is now Monday and I call in to follow up with my request and apparently the doctor wants a follow up scheduled to handle these issues in 3 WEEKS WHEN SHE GETS BACK FROM VACATION!" VACATION???  I have immediate health concerns and she suddenly leaves for 3 weeks without giving patients any notice? So the gentlemen in the office offered to schedule me in with another doctor until then. No, sir why under these horrible circumstances would I stay with your practice, this has been a horrible experience with a horrible doctor! His response "your right, I completely understand. Bye."  Staff rude, doctor not attentive to medical needs and concers, no bedside manner, no courtesy for patients, schedules unnecessary tests, outdated medical equipment,  dirty office and patient rooms etc.  POINT IS: DON'T EVER TRUST THIS DOCTOR, OR PRACTICE they don't even deserve one star...going back to my regular, 100% trustworthy doctor...Dr. Rotella in Scottsdale!
1 Dr Dugan lacks empathy and humanity. For her attending to a sick person is of less importance compared to attending a game. I got an appointment with dr Dugan fortunately because someone else cancelled theirs..I reached her office few minutes late and she refused to see me just because she had to go out for a game. I requested several times that I would be very quick to telling her my problems but of no use as for her a game was more important than a sick person. The staff told me that there is no point asking for another appointment because there is no availability for next two months with any doctors in their facility. This is so sad that it takes us months to get an appointment with a doctor..it doesn't matter how much we have to wait for a doctor but when it comes to us we are purly on their mercy...
5 I've been getting chiro and massage therapy from AZ spine for a few months now and I can honestly say I've had major improvements. The staff here are attentive and friendly
5 (Testing out this new iPhone app!) Carry the world's problems on my shoulders has been a pain in the neck, so I began investigating my AZ State health insurance plan to see what I could get, before I get canned or before AZ decides to discard all benefits and lower wages so McCain and Sheriff Joe can buy bigger guns.  Coworker recommended this place, Dr. Genet is great, staff friendly, low copay. Weight of the world...still there, but body (and mind) is better able to deal!
5 This office is beyond accommodating, the scheduler works with clients and is always willing to help and work around your schedule. The staff are knowledgable and very personable, they focus on your needs the entire session and give at home exercises and tips as well.  They are encouraging when things are difficult and they make you laugh while your completing your exercises.  I would highly recommend this office to anyone looking for a physical therapist in central Phoenix.  I visited this office for two months 2-5 a week in 2014.
5 When I first came here it was simply because they are in network for me and close to my home. Now after actually visiting I was very well pleased by the service that was provided, from front end staff, to the PA that I saw. They are very pleasant people, and truly made me feel like they care. My PA was Nicole, and I will gladly make this my primary office, just simply because of the way I was treated. They were very kind, and I felt very welcome.  Thank you!!
5 Zen massage is by far the BEST place to go for a massage. I have been to a number of places, none of which compare to Zen. They Listen to what you need worked on and do an overall outstanding job. I've used the same massage therapist each time and I'm pretty much useless the remainder of the day - I'm too afraid to mention who I go to because I don't want him to be booked up so much that I can't make my next appointment!!
2 So, having never seen Dr Patel I have no idea what the practice is like, but the receptionist was the rudest lady I have talked to in the phone in a Long Long time. When she answered the phone she already sounded annoyed. I told her I wished to make an appointment and her one word response of "name" was full of pure ire. I would have told her I was a new patient if she's literally given me seconds before cutting me off to ask for my name. So after we struggle through spelling my name she asks me for my insurance and I tell her. She says they don't take it, and doesn't even let me get to the PPO part where you can see people out of network. Maybe that doesn't matter, health insurance is weird, but that's kinda what I thought he point of a PPO was. But I would never go here anyway purely based on how much she obviously dislikes phone calls or people or whatever. Maybe she was having a bad day, but my instinct leans toward no and she's just frustratingly brisk. *Update! Just checked through my insurance provider and guess what- they totally are listed as taking my plan. This lady doesn't listen and appears not to know her stuff*
2 Never answers FAXES from pharmacies to refill prescriptions!! My husband is diabetic and every time we tell him he is COMPLETELY out of insulin the office staff takes their sweet time writing the prescription! And we try contacting them at least a week before he runs out! The pharmacy says they fax 2-3 times and not response is given. The office staff always claims they never receive any faxes (maybe they are completely unorganized and throw them away or something....or maybe they just don't care. Just wait until sometimes dies from not filling a prescription on time...They need to fire whomever is responsible for not answering the faxes.  Doctor also has an email, which he RARELY ever responds to. I think we have emailed him like 5x and only had one reply.   Our father has the Same exact insurance as we do, but for some reason they like to charge us TRIPLE what he pays for the same service (copay). They claim its the insurance that sets it, but our father has the EXACT SAME INSURANCE and our insurance card says the copay right on it is $25 and they like to charge $86!!!!! SCAM SCAM SCAM!!!!!   The doctor is nice, however we will not be back due to the office staff, and being overcharged. In my opinion they owe us money.
1 Are you kidding me? Me and my wife was involved in a serious car accident with a newborn, 3 yr old and 12 yr old. Our vehicle was totaled and we brought to ER here and waited to be seen and took a total of  8 hrs to be seen by a doctor.. Waited 5 hrs in waiting room and 2 more hours waiting for the doctor to finally check us and then another 1hr to be just checked out!! WTF?! NEVER AGAIN GOING HERE And there was a handful of sick people here that waited even longer than us! If i could give 0 stars i would!
4 Good service is vital to the survival of these types of places. I can honestly say that  GOOD SERVICE is what you will get at this location. From the pricing to the promptness of being seen, the care and knowledge of the care provider and true concern for the patients.   If you need to be seen by someone other than your regular care provider or just don't have a regular provider, I don't think you'll be disappointed here. Give it a try. IN AND OUT
1 Do not waste your time. Went in for back pain associated with migraines and after an 2 hours of waiting and filling out all the forms the doctor said he wouldn't even see me because of prescriptions I have.  I put in the paperwork that I had been prescribed but do not take them as I am still in pain.... Hence seeing a 'pain specialist'. Instead I am made to feel like a jerk and they take me in the hall with secretary who knows absolutely nothing about me.  Horrible way to handle something, horrible way to treat someone who is just trying to solve problem so I don't have to take anything at all!  Everyone in the lobby was complaining about something. That should of been a heads up right there.
5 I have never been a chiropractor fan.  Too many bad experiences.  But my daughter worked here briefly and convinced me to go.  For the first time in 15 years, the pain in my lower back and leg stopped!  AND he gave me great advice and easy exercises to KEEP the pain away.  He doesn't nag me to go in every week, just when needed.  I am just amazed.
5 Went to see this doctor today and glad I chose him out of so many doctors in Yelp. This was due mostly to other Yelp reviews. The practice is very clean and the reception n nurse are very nice and friendly. Had a little wait but not their fault...had to wait for insurance to approve change of primary care physician. Dr. Sharma is a very nice and thoughtful doctor. He took the time to discuss my visit n to explain everything that was at issue...very sincere and patient...the office was a little busy but did not have to wait long like at other practices where the appointments are always overbooked. Will bring my kids here but knock on wood. lol. A really good find and thanks to earlier reviews by other Yelpers.
5 Dr Sharma by far was the best primary doctor I have ever seen. I went to 3 doctors before I saw him and he is extremely knowledgable and doesnt just throw a script at you in 3min. He really cares and wants to see you get well. He asked me so many questions and got to the root of everything. Im incredibly happy to know that I have found a primary doctor for life. Im beyond grateful. $100 office visit. $200 general check up. Worth it. I spent close to $1000 before seeing him on doctors that prescribed me antibiotics that nearly killed me because they didnt take the time to know my condition.
1 Terrible  experience! I have been seeing JD Michaels (excellent PA) for 5 years, he worked under Dr. Wade. During that time Dr Wade has never once called me with any test results or showed any interest in my care. Once, I went into see Dr Wade and he did adjustments on me, which should not be done on someone with Ankylosing Spondalitis, I vowed to never return to him, as I did not appreciate his use of medicine on someone in my condition, I therefor just used his PA, whom took great care of me.  They have recently had some changes in what PA's work for what Dr's. They will not allow me to see JD any longer. The person that has been taking care of me for almost 5 years. Dr. Wade refuses to give up his patients, like I'm his property or something.  Maybe if he had taken better care of me, I wouldn't be insisting on going elsewhere or seeing JD. If Dr Wade cared about me as a patient he would release me to see the person that has been taking care of me.  Now, they are refusing to refill my prescriptions, and the office manager hung up on me, real professional!! I recommend you find another Dr, that's what I'm doing,
1 My last review was while I was a patient and I didn't  want my true review to cause my treatment  to be worse! I went there for months without improvement.  The would have me lay on heat, then do little exercise that I could do at home, because they make more  money  the longer your visit,  then use ice, each thing is a charge. At one point I asked the therapist, Older guy named Richard, why he didn't  do massage as I knew it would help immensely  wirh my injuries, he told me insurance did not allow them to do massage. I then witnessed other therapists using massage  on patients. I also witnessed a Richard use a to well on which he had sprayed the ad pray they use to wipe down the equipment when he was touching another patient. So, he evidently has a touch phobia  or something,  so why is he a physical  therapist!  He was more interested in bragging about who he had worked  on than my healing! I ended up switching to the office manager, also a therapist.  I eventually left this office after months and went to Tim Ferron, my improvement there was far superior  and faster.  I would never recommend  Physiotherapy  Associates!  My recuperation  from my car accident  too much longer than it should have, do infuriating! !
1 I came in which isn't my first visit to this location at 830 there was no wait I told her I needed to be seen and she told me that they only had an NP and they couldn't prescribe narcotics and that she couldn't help me. One I understand I came 30 min before closing but given I have 4 kids I had to wait for my husband to get off work two as a nurse that has worked in a hospital for over 5 years I don't appreciate being lied to.. And three assuming I was there for narcotics is discriminating! As I walked out I see not only what could have been a doctor or Pa In scrubs sitting with his bag ready to leave there was also another dr or medical staff in scrubs sitting there. I am upset if they were honest and said look we arnt seeing anymore patients I could respect that but to lie to someone because they are simply lazy I am disgusted and I will make sure to go back to work and make sure no one uses this urgent care again and myself and family will never return.. What's the point of being the only one open til 9 if you stop seeing  patients at 830
5 I started going to Dr. Grant about a year ago for some lower back pain I was experiencing from sitting in an office chair too frequently. The entire staff there has been fantastic, from the front office to the physical therapy team. The atmosphere is also a big perk for me. It's a great balance between friendly, personal, easy going, and professional. After a while it feels like you're just going to visit some friends who happen to be great at keeping people healthy.   I couldn't fully endorse Grant Chiropractic if I didn't also see impressive results in my lower bank pain, muscle tension, flexibility, and spinal alignment. I could definitely tell a difference after I missed a few sessions over the holidays.   Special shout out to Dr. Brandon. He continues to be a wealth of knowledge on most any subject I bring up with him, from athletics, to muscle repair, to pain management, workout recovery, stretching, and body mechanics. He's helped me understand and work through tendon issues, joint issues, and back pain better than my primary physician. His friendly and open nature make his expertise easy to access which is a running theme through the rest of the staff as well.   Thanks Grant Chiropractic.
1 The doctor is good. It's all downhill from there!!  The doc was Carter. He was professional and is a good surgeon. He has been in the game for a very long time. The downside is he is a teaching doctor and always has another doctor shadowing him. I believe that as a patient you should be asked if you mind this. Personally I do. I'd prefer some one on one with my surgeon.  The downhill to this place is their MRI staff!! Namely the schedulers and front desk folks. Ledi I believe her name was. Insanely rude! To the point I had to ask another patient "did you find the girl at the front to be rude"? His response "incredibly rude".  Not sure why a company needs to have a person like this be a scheduler. It's just nuts. You should have people skills doing this job.  I won't be using these folks for my should surgery. I'll be taking my MRI results elsewhere for the surgery. I can only imagine what the follow ups are gonna be like here.   Pass.
1 Avoid this clinic at all costs! All the good reviews i have found are old. I visited Dr. holland who was very very rude to me didn't listen to me walked out preemptively and told the ladies in the front desk details about my appt! Who does that?! I came back to see Janine his NP because she seemed really nice and caring. Also their nurse who took my vitals is really nice too. She doesn't know much about medical tests but she's really good at her particular job. I had an appt at 915. At 1012 am i was still waiting to be seen. She was however very understanding and caring. Janine is good at explaining things but she's certainly not punctual. One thing is for sure. If you absolutely need to be seen i suggest Janine. Avoid Dr Holland!! I'm never coming here again and i suggest you don't waste your time.
1 Plan on waiting a minimum of 45 minutes to call and make or change an appointment. Once you get them on the phone they say oh we'll call you back. You won't hear from them so you'll call and wait 45 minutes again only to hear "we'll call you back". This place has NO regard for their patents time! As I type this I've been on hold 37:13 to change an appointment time.
1 My husband had an appointment and it still took 3 hours and they never sent his prescription. Find some place else!
5 Just had my first wrap and vibration session and it was Great! They are knowledgeable and friendly. The spa is clean and the staff is awesome! Excellent service! Highly recommend the service.
5 I have been going to Back In Action now for a while for physical therapy on my shoulder. Carla Lampert the DPT there is AMAZING also the Massage Therapist Zac. They have helped me tremendously with my pain and shoulder issues! All hands on with the Doctor, individual therapy rooms for more a private setting. I would highly highly recommend Back In Action Pain Therapy to anyone! They have changed my life! Thank you all so much!
5 I took mat Pilates for years and loved it. I was told by my physio that I needed to diversify my workouts or would continue to risk injury, so I thought why not try Pilates because I loved it in the past.   This studio is small and clean and comfortable. Everyone is nice-- Vanessa the owner sent me an email after my first class to check in and make sure everything was ok. Class sizes are small and instructors pay attention to form. I loved my first reformer class and have been taking classes twice weekly now for 8 weeks. I feel stronger when I run and also just in general. I haven't had a recurrence of my running injuries since/yet; I believe the strength training and stretching that I'm incorporating via Pilates are at least somewhat to thank for this.   Mae and Vanessa are my favorite instructors, but like I said, everyone is nice.   I'm hooked!
1 This office is a joke! Don't expect a call back or if you need an appointment and you are a regular patient, expect to wait 3 weeks to a month. They do not put you health care first!!!!
5 Huge turnaround in the office staff, both front and back office.  I'm pretty sure they completely cleaned house in 2013.   Here's how I found out: I recently tried to leave Desert View, and Stacie. As much as I wanted to stay with Stacie I just couldn't handle her front office staff any longer.    I went to another doctor that came very highly recommended and I was so disappointed I just took my lab work with the intent of just braving the horrible office staff so that I could have Stacie read my lab results.  She really was the only one I trusted with helping me decide my next steps on this particular illness.   I was glad I tried to go back because when I called...  ...my call was answered inside minutes,  ...on a Tuesday morning,  ...by a human,  ...who was helpful.  The experience in the office followed suit.  A nice lady copied my card, another nice lady took my co-payment, and yet another nice lady called my name and got me ready to see Stacie.    It's the best of both worlds now!  If you have a doctor there that you love, you can feel good about yourself again because you are no longer putting yourself through the degrading hell that you once did.  You ARE a person!  Desert View Family Medicine (evidently) knows it too!  On that note, if you've left Desert View because of their horrible office staff but loved your doctor there, I really recommend giving them another shot.  I did, and I'm here to report that it was a good decision.
5 My first visit was totally awesome!  I never considered anything like this until I received this visit for my birthday.  Just goes to show you that no matter what your age is, you've got to be open to new things! This facility has lovely decor, but the best feature is that everything is super clean and immaculate.  Chris and Vianca welcome clients to their spa with warmth and class.  Give it a try.  You won't be disappointed!
5 My new favorite crystal shop in Vegas! I came in today just to browse around and I got goosebumps as soon as I walked in the door. I was greeted by the owner, Tammy. She was so sweet, helpful, and so full of energy. They have a wonderful selection of crystals for such a teeny shop. I can't wait to come back and try reiki with Tammy!
4 Great place for relaxation and an alternative to traditional health care! The facilities were nice, and the staff friendly. I loved the waiting area and the colourful walls. It just felt really peaceful in there. The place was (immaculately) clean and I felt very comfortable.   With a number of therapists working here, they tend to have great availability.  I was able to book an appointment through their website (gesund.ca) at about 2pm and had an appointment set for 6pm.    Dr. Tebruegge and all of the staff I've dealt with are extremely knowledgeable in their fields and are committed to making a difference in people's health.  They always keep appointments on time, take all of my concerns into account, and are caring and professional.
5 Great use of various approaches to address pain and musculoskeletal problems. I come here because I have mild scoliosis and what's called a "military neck" which causes constant discomfort and pain/tension. Coming on a weekly basis has improved my posture, lessened the occurrence of pain and the need for regular treatments over time. I like that the doctors spend quality time and use a variety of techniques to help me achieve positive and long-term results.
4 This place isn't anything super special, but I haven't had a bad experience here yet  and we've been coming for at least two years.   Sometimes the wait can be longer than expected but if you're not on a time crunch or impatient then it's not a problem.   Dr Laura and dr Theresa are really sweet and dr Robertson is cool too. Some of the nurses are more gentle and quick with vaccines than others, but no one has given me a reason to be upset with they way they handle my child. The front desk receptionists are very nice and informative. Check out is pretty fast.   Prices without insurance...honestly I don't know what to compare it to because this is the first year I've been a 'cash patient', but I didn't find it to be unreasonable.   All in all it's been a 'typical' experience having my kid as a patient here. But in happy enough with their services to drive out of my way to continue to see these doctors/nurses.
1 The reason this office gets one star is they have some really great doctors (so I hear) and some or at least one that is not so great (unluckily, I chose her), but the problem is, is that once you chose a doctor, even if you haven't seen them before, you cannot change doctors. In my mind, this is ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS. I would never go back to see the doctor I saw. She was very cold, uninviting, no personality, etc. So they would rather lose my business altogether than to allow me to switch to one of their better doctors that can actually communicate and relate to their patients. That's just bad business sense.
1 Norma the office manager clearly doesn't know how to operate her office since she has her front office staff telling people it's a 90 minute wait when it's really a 3 hour wait. Completely uncalled for and they are all extremely rude. Never coming back again. If it wasn't for the Las Vegas casinos using this place for their employees work injuries I'm sure it would be shut down
1 I just left this place and had to write a review. I wasn't even seen and I am already disappointed. I have severe abdominal pain for two days and thought that I should finally see a doctor. Only facility close to my house that is open 24 hours. I used to work at an urgent care so I know how it works.  The lady in the front didn't even bother to stop what she was doing to even talk to me.  Hello customer service???  I understand you needed to get your work done, but heck have the decency to even look at me when you talk!  I asked her if she was in network with United Health Care (I don't want to be billed out of network) and she said she doesn't know and only takes your insurance. I mean really?  When I worked at an urgent care I knew who was in network and out of network.  I know that the insurance companies are closed on weekends to even answer my question so she should have known.  I was going to take a chance so I decided that I wanted to be seen. I asked her how long the wait is and she told me about two hours because there is only one physician on staff.  It is a Saturday night /  Sunday morning and you can at least have another physician available.  I know for sure I am not coming back here again. It made a bad impression on me.
1 I will first state that I never actually went to Shea's medical center. My review is based on my phone interaction.   I already know my son has chronic Lyme and babesiosis. I am desperately trying to find someone to save his life. Their website states they take insurance, I was overjoyed when I saw that. Unfortunately when I called I was told they would not accept my insurance for anything related to Lyme. Instead I was quoted an approximate cost of 50k. The woman suggested I contact my church or family to raise the money. I am a single parent trying to safe my sons life and all they care about is upfront payment of thousands of dollars? I don't belong to a church, I have no family, and I just started a new job. I don't know people with that kind of money. What happened to the Hippocratic Oath??  They need to update their website to clearly state that they do not accept insurance for Lyme. I also don't believe there is a Lyme Literate doctor on staff. Makes me question if they would even be capable of helping my son if we could afford it. If I had 50k I'd be traveling to see a true Lyme specialist.
1 I've received a couple of mailers from EOS, talking about a $9.95/month membership, and a free 7 day pass to try out the gym.   On April 1, I decided to take advantage of the free trial, and drove over.   I have to say, I'm not impressed at all.   To do the free trial, they set you up to talk to a manager...well when I was there, he was too busy to talk to me.  He told me to go ahead and do my workout, and then to come talk to him when I was done.    Ok fine.  So, I did my workout.  Free weights and a little bit of time on the treadmill.   Honestly, I didn't care for the vibe I was getting from the place, plus...it took me a long time to find machines, bathrooms, etc, since I wasn't given a tour or anything.    After my workout, I went to talk to the manager, who was REALLY pushy about signing up for their $24.99 membership, even though I said I was interested in the $9.95.    Look. I get that you guys probably get some kind of commission, but do NOT be pushy with me. Don't pressure me into getting your most expensive membership.  I obviously want to join a gym, so you don't have to do the hard sell.  I don't WANT the "all inclusive" price.  All I really need access to are weights, machines, and cardio equipment.  A class would be fun, but not a necessity.  And I definitely don't need unlimited tanning.    Also...your sign up fees are astronomical compared to other gyms in town.  $9.95/month with a $100 sign up fee?  Screw that.    I only went to this gym twice during my 7 day trial, because even after my second visit, I still didn't like the vibe.  I got a text message from them about signing up, which is a turn off.  Let me try your gym.  Show me around.  Tell me if my free trial includes classes (because I had no clue if I could try one or not.)   But LEAVE ME ALONE until the end of my trial, unless you're just asking how I like it.  I don't like feeling pressured.  That is the biggest way to lose me as a client.    Also...even if you think  it, don't make the comment of "Most people who do the 7 day trial who want the $10 a month plan don't sign up."  What a rude thing to say.  Honestly, I might have dropped the $100 to sign up here, had it not been for the rude, car salesman vibe I got.    In addition, the layout, for me, was confusing.  I couldn't find/see any stretching racks at all, and there really wasn't space that I saw for stretching, so I did all of that in the dressing rooms.    Not the best place in town, by a long shot.
5 You definitely don't get the small-town doctors office feeling in this office however every doctor that I have dealt with there is absolutely amazing and very sincere and caring about my needs. They always get me in on time and when I called last minute they get me in the same day. I have nothing negative to say about them whatsoever. I attended Sun City location.
5 Dr. Hogan is the best!!!  I recently injured my shoulder working out and decided to try the natural route first.  Boy was I amazed, not only did he completely explain to me what was going on in detail, but put my shoulder back in place and further stabilized it with what he called kinesio tape....you know the type that was popular with olympic athletes.  All I can say is that I am grateful for Dr. Hogan and his approach to my health, I feel great and can't wait to tell all my friends.  Thanks again doc!
5 I came in on 4 July with bruised ribs. I was able to get in and see the doctor within 15 minutes. I would use this urgent care again.
5 My husband bought me a one house session for Valentines Day and now I am hooked. This place was fantastic, I had Janice as my therapist and she was incredible. This was the best massage I have ever had. She focused on my back because that is where most of my pain is focused and I felt so much better afterwards. She even showed me a few massages I could do myself while I was in the shower to help with the tension in my shoulders. I will be going back here for sure!
1 My mother was transferred to st John's rehab centre after a knee replacement surgery. I was happy at the beginning befor I get there and we start our hell of a time with the " nurses from Hell" that the proper name to call those nurses. To be fair not all the nurses are like that , some of them are nice, kind and compassionate and treat patient with dignity, but the other ones are the worst you can imagine. They treated her in a very degrading manner not putting into consideration that she is incapable to help herself ( hopefully temporary) , the nurse refused to get her any food from the fridge when she was hungry at night and I heard the nurse telling her Hushhhhh when she asked her to get her a yogurt, she refused to get it for her.  The rehab and the physiotherapists are great and kind and do their work great, but some nurses really deserve the tittle, " NURSE FROM HELL". On one occasion my daughter which is a physician herself called requesting to talk to her grandmother physician and the nurse refused to give her his name or telephone number and when she did not accept  it and told the nurse that she is not acting in a proper way, the nurse answer to that was " welcome to Toronto, that's how we do business here", my daughter was shocked and stopped the conversation after asking the nurse of her name, because she is filling an official complaint against the nurse and her unprofessional way talking to patient family member and a prfoessional caregiver too. I feel so bad for the helpless patients there who do not have any one to speak on their behalf. I am capable to hire a private PSW to be with my mother at this rehab centre during her stay, but not everyone else can do that. It is a disgrace to the name SunnyBrook.
1 This provider is horrible! The people in the actual office aren't bad, but good luck getting to talk to them! The entire "East Valley Family Medical" system is impossible to navigate and the staff is unbelievably unhelpful. What a joke. I'm switching providers this instant!
5 I am not a person that gives good reviews lightly...especially in medicine.  I have worked in the medical industry for many years.  Dr. Brewster has been my doctor for several years now and it has been a normal patient doctor relationship.  (I will get into the reasons I like this practice in a moment).  I went to see Dr. Brewster the other day for an important visit, I come over an hour 1 way to see this doctor and I had run into some traffic.  I was the last visit before lunch and I called explaining that I was running 10 minutes late.  The doctor stayed and waited to see me and was so compassionate!  I was so impressed!  And after all that I had asked if he could take over my care for another specialty and manage another script I had (I know...I was pushing it...this other doctor had a  month waiting period to get in and it is just a routine office visit for prescription refill once a year)  He said absolutely and filled the script and took over that care,  not only making my healthcare more seamless but also more cost effective for me as well as the insurance company.  Just an awesome doctor!  Now for the practice:  The reason I drive so far for this practice: wait time:  ZERO.  This practice understands the definition of the word appointment.  I am very busy.  if I schedule an appointment and a doctor is running late, I am infuriated.  THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED HERE  This practice runs like a well oiled machine.  I have Never had to wait for my appointment.  AND they never ask me to show up  minutes early, AGAIN they know the definition of the word appointment and do not think their time is more value than mine...RESPECT.  Appointment setting:  This practice CAN set an appointment the same day (I am not saying to abuse this PRIVILEGE I am just saying that in an emergency it is possible.  This is HYPER responsible in the healthcare system.  Many patients use the emergency room as a doctors office.  This is a horrible abuse of the healthcare system and very inefficient for both the patient and the hospital.  This doctors office KNOWS how to handle patients and their lives.  They schedule in a few emergency appointments.  WOW....what a concept!  Better healthcare.  Experience:  A LAB in the office...enough said..  Spa like atmosphere.  Wifi...HUGE TV's couches.  Whoever is running this practice should be hired out to consult on every doctors office.  No crappy plastic chairs.  Awesome home tv shows (half the time I wish they were running late so I could watch the end of, and FREE WIFI where I am usually seeing signs to get the heck off my phone.  They are definitely embracing our technology based world.  This is the most socially advanced practice I have been to.  I wish I could clone this and show it to every doctors office.  Kudos to North Scottsdale Family Practice for keeping Patient satisfaction always the most important part of the experience!
5 Doctor Wolf is outstanding and his facility is first class.  Yes, he is good and he's busy.  And when I've really needed to get in to see him, I did.
5 So far impressed!  Didn't wait long at all, everyone super nice and knowledgeable!  I'd definitely recommend.  I'll be bringing my son and daughter here
1 My mother required transport to the hospital Emergency Room and was ultimately admitted to the ICU. This facility DID NOT call 911. They called a private ambulance service. Montefiore was told the wait time would be 60-90 minutes!! Totally unacceptable. From the time we were told the ambulance was called, until she arrived at the Emergency Room..... almost 2 hours had past. TERRIBLE!!! Why couldn't these people call 911? Bed sores, pneumonia, etc.  How did they miss all of this?
5 One of my friends referred me here and they have been amazing from day one. Their location is conveniently located right off the 60 and the facility itself is so warming and inviting inside. The girls, Ann and Megan, are so sweet and kind and everyone takes a true and genuine concern on how you're doing. I've been seeing Dr. Steve for a few months now and my posture is noticeably better and headaches  seem have diminished. I'm very happy with their business and strongly recommend them! :)
5 Kara is awesome her techniques and movements helped release tension and back pains  I have .  will be back
4 The entire staff here is really nice and know what they are doing.  They have somewhat odd hours, but they are really flexible with rescheduling and don't charge fees for missing an appointment.  They only part that annoys me is that Dr. Scharf tends to talk too much sometimes.  I don't mind shooting the breeze or listen to his interesting conversations with others, but sometimes I am in a hurry and wish he's do a little more cracking and a little less yapping.
1 So this place is great if you want to get pills for all sorts of problems. When it comes down to being a doctor, they are the worst. Miss diagnosed 3 times and let alone the prices for all their treatments. On top of that, they charge for paperwork that needs to be filled out for employer's when you get sick. Over all, my doctor now. Is not a doctor at all!!!!!!
4 Husband made an appointment for the little one. I told him to find a GOOD doctor. I got to the offices, receptionist was very friendly. Nice spacious waiting room. Proceeded to check phone while waiting, check-in on Yelp etc. I was surprised the ratings were only 3 so I read the reviews. Of course the 1 star reviews were for the new doc that hubby had made an appointment with. At this point I Was not looking forward to the appointment and contemplated leaving and getting a refund for my co-pay before we got called back but decided to see how things went. I'm glad I stayed and saw Dr. Shi. She was not bad at all, didn't get any bad impression or vibe. Straight forward appointment, she seemed to ask the right questions to make her assessment of what was wrong with my little one. Just goes to show you shouldn't always rely on reviews alone.
5 The Synergy Physical Therapy team is fantastic!!  I was diagnosed with breast cancer this year, had surgery and treatment.  I had lost some of my range of motion in my arm along with developing a condition called "cording" in my underarm from my breast surgery.  Synergy was the only place that actually knew what I was talking about when I was looking for a therapy place to go to.  Tarah had had previous clients with this issue.  They put me on a path to get back to where I was, I am very grateful to them.  Ladies, if there is anyone out there that is going through breast cancer surgery, Synergy Physical Therapy is the place to go and you can trust them with your total well being.
1 Updated after 4 visits to the Dr.  They gave me too much hormones and it made me feel a lot worse then before I went in, when I told them this they responded by let's do the same treatment again.  They told my husband that they wanted to see his testosterone at 1200, but both his Cardiologist and Endocrinologist told us that was way to high (needs to be under 700, 500-600 better), and high testosterone causes heart problems and can cause prostate cancer.  They told us many lies about costs (something would be free/covered by insurance when it was not.  1) I asked for a pap smear & mammogram & hormone balancing when scheduling my first visit.  I saw a Dr/PA for 10 minutes each visit plus other staff members who didn't give names/positions.  The first visit they read the paperwork and got blood work.  They said if they did the pap smear/mammogram "they don't get paid by insurance if they do two things at the same visit".  They would not schedule these when I left saying the Dr would do this.  The second visit the Dr said I needed Estrogen, Testosterone, Progesterone, and Thyroid but again "no time" for the pap smear/mammogram and no appointment.  The pellets were pushed hard and I felt like I got the used car salesman rush - I don't expect that from a Dr.  When I asked about other choices, they discouraged pills or creams and when I still wasn't sure about the pellets the Dr walked out of the room and with her back to me said let the staff know.  Unfortunately since I wanted to feel better and no other options were given I agreed to the pellets (Estrogen & Testosterone) and someone rushed me thru signing the forms, saying of course check this box that you have not had a pap smear in the last year.  The whole visit was rush-rush. At home I looked over the paperwork and under the box saying No I haven't had a pap smear & mammogram within the last year said is said therefore I would not hold the Drs liable if I got cancer (from the treatment).  WHAT?  They wouldn't give me the tests when I asked for them, they pushed the pellets, and then it was my fault if I got cancer?  Another paper said people taking hormone replacement for the first time (me) typically do NOT do pellets, but if you really want them you can get them.  Again WHAT?  I had said I was not sure about pellets, but that was the only choice I was given.  At a later visit they said "well... that is what we do - put pellets in".  2) I felt horrible after the pellets (much worse than they said I would).  I called for an appointment to discuss this & again asked for a pap smear - I was assured I could do both in the same visit.  At the visit I said the side effects were most important, the PA listened, then said let's do the pap smear, then "didn't have time" to discuss the pellet problems.  3) One of the papers I took home had said the pellets would last 3-4 months.  At the 5 week mark to review the pellets I was greeted in the lobby with a "You signed this before but we need it again" - like there was a problem with the first form.  The form was permission to put in more pellets. I questioned this & was told "The first pellets never last, you need your 5 week boosters".  I said I wanted to talk to the Dr first as I was still sick from the pellets and the thyroid pills gave me hyperthyroid symptoms.  The Dr never said let's do this so you feel better, she just talked about putting more pellets in.  When I resisted, she said I had a serious unrelated medical condition and immediately needed a bunch of tests.  I ran all this by my regular Dr said the next day and he said I had no problems. He felt they created an "emergency" to distract from them not addressing my side effects to the pellets.  4) Other women there told me they ALWAYS got pellets every 5 weeks.  At the pellet followup visit the Dr told me they ignored estrogen levels, they only looked at FHS.  The medicine manufacturers (for my pellets) told me I was given too much Estrogen and that testosterone of 1200 was way too high for guys & that we needed other labs to monitor things than the ones DeRosa's office were taken.  E.G.  Test for when the testosterone was starting to affect the prostate negatively rather than wait until the cancer shows in a PSA test.  5) Expect high costs:  They told me hormone tests were free (they were not), that things were covered by insurance that were not, and didn't bill for months so the first bill was over $1000 (would have been higher if I agreed to pellets the 2nd time).  I heard someone else talking about her high bill at the window.  Others told me the same thing happened to them.  6) I now have a better Dr.  She gives one hormone at a time as they can all affect each other.  She pays attention to symptoms not just test results (one person's low is another person's normal).  The new Dr reduced the problems the pellets were causing me (DeRosa never tried to do this).  The new Dr does more testing than De Rosa does which they say gives better information.
5 I have been a patient of Dr. Petrick's for over 3 years now. Initially I went to him after I destroyed my lower back from squats. The pain was so terrible that I could barely walk and when I managed to walk I was hunched over at a 90 degree angle. Dr. Petrick told me that he would fix my back in 10 visits using Active Release Therapy (ART), chiropractic adjustments, the traction machine, and ice. He was certainly right, 10 visits later and I was completely fixed.  I now visit him once a month for full body maintenance. I train for triathlons so everything is constantly under some sort of stress. He's always there to get me right back to training if I have an issue however my monthly visits almost guarantee that doesn't happen unless I'm completely foolish.  In my opinion the ART treatments are the key to his superior treatment. My previous chiropractor wasn't able to achieve even close to as good results.
5 This is a fantastic physical therapy center. Derek and Sara are knowledgable and highly-skilled, and the rest of the staff could not be more friendly and efficient. The center has an upbeat vibe, and treatment plans are individualized and closely managed. Highly-recommended for those in need.
5 Thank goodness for Dr. Kuhn!! After more than 2 months of ineffective treatment elsewhere (including 10 physical therapy sessions, dry needling 12 times, 6 appointments with a different chiropractor & a few massages) totaling nearly $2000, I finally got results/ relief, felt better and was able to workout again immediately following my 1st appointment with Dr. Kuhn. I only wish I had gone to him initially! As a healthcare professional, I highly recommend him & praise his work. I am so grateful for his knowledge, experience and effectiveness.
4 Never been to a chiropractor before but am glad I tried one out first here. The chiropractic adjustment takes about 10-15mins. After that, the assistant taught me some stretches/exercises to complement the adjustment. So with a reasonable insurance co-pay this helped me over the few months I made appointments here.
5 I am a retired deputy from LASD and have had chronic lower back pain from an on duty accident and wearing the gunbelt. My orthopedic surgen said if he was to do surgery he would need to fuse five levels of my back. He said until I couldn't take the pain any more he would not recommend surgery. We are new here and I met Sarah at Leisure World seminar and asked her if she could help me, and she said yes. We have had trials and errors with my therapy, but of late we hit the mother lode to help me with taking pain medication. I know she can't cure me, but if I don't have to take alot of pain medication, that is a win for me. I highly recommend her expecially if you are in law enforcement or a fire fighter.
5 We had a Great experience here today. I am usually apprehensive to take my pets to new doctors but this one as close to home and they got me In Pretty quickly! They were very accommodating to my very shy dog! I don't feel like I was overcharged and the rooms were very nice!
1 Had an appointment at10:20 for only results. 3 hrs later and still waitin to see the doctor. They just took me in the back to weigh me and take my vital signs. I just cant u derstand why is has to take this long for a follow up when i have an appointment. Horrible service and all the receptionist say is the doctor is busy. He takes his time with eqch patient. Do not come to this place. I sure wont ever come back. Left a star cause it wont let me post without a star that they dont deserve.
5 AZ Body Mechanics is the ultimate full body healing location. You can basically do everything there from massage, to chiropractic services. In addition, they offer free workouts with stuff like P90X and Insanity. Very cool indeed.
1 We went to see Dr. Johnston for the referral to see colonoscopy. He gave us a Dr. Sheldon Freed. So I called Dr. Freed and requested for colonoscopy appointment. They said they don't do the colonoscopy. So I called back to Dr. Johnston to get the CORRECT doctor who does the colonoscopy. He gave me a new one with the phone number. I called and requested for appointment. The number they gave me was Women's Well Care. They don't do the colonoscopy. I called the insurance company. They gave me the CORRECT doctor for the colonoscopy. Their management skills are poor. They have very strict rules/policy which was ridiculous.  Highly do not recommend him at all.
3 This place is hit and miss but overall the doctors are alright but the lady at walk-in reception area is not very friendly. It is conveniently located in the PATH which makes it easy to pop-in at lunch.
5 The staff at LVPRC are all very welcoming and helpful, I had a great experience.  I called after I was in an auto accident and Kathryn got me in the next day to see Dr. Oku.  Dr. Oku is very knowledgeable and you leave his office feeling a lot better.  I worked mostly with Dr. Oku and Miles and they take the time to make sure you get the treatments and teaching you need to stay free from pain.  Kathryn and Jessica are very helpful and friendly and easy to work with, communication was never a problem. I would recommend anyone who needs pain relief of any kind to go here!.
5 I had a low back problem about 6 months ago that wouldn't go away.  PhysioPlus Health Group was recommended to me by my doctor and it was the best thing he could have done for me.  The clinic is has a team of therapists (physiotherapists, osteopaths, massage therapists and a chiropractor) that really do work together to help their patients.  The physiotherapists spent a lot of one-on-one time with me doing hands-on treatment and showing me exercises.  My pain is gone and I'm back to ny normal life again! I highly recommend this clinic!
1 Hi All,  Just an update, 2/23/2013- I changed Drs because of the admin fee and the office is still trying to charge another "administration fee".  Soooo that pretty much means there is a bi-annual admin fee charged.  Was forced to pay the first fee because I was a patient, trying to get the most recent fee charged last month removed since I'm not their patient- patient beware, it's like a bad late night infomercial, "How do I cancel???!"  grrrrr
5 Dr. Josh is an excellent chiropractor.  As a personal injury attorney, I work with chiro and physical therapists on a daily basis.  Dr. Josh is knowledgeable, professional and very high energy.  Without hesitation, I am pleased to refer my personal injury clients to Dr. Josh; I am confident in knowing they will receive terrific treatment.
2 Some people believe some don't.  They have you watch a video to convince.  Jump on my back, I am not a fan.  Dr. Q is nice.  XRays and all, just a guy jumping on my back.  The profession 1 star.
1 The "Doctor" is drunk and the help is drinking in the back. We will be suing this place. If you get the doctor that is black and doesn't have a chin, run.  This place is going to get sued for malpractice. Steer clear
4 We really enjoyed our experience here, getting both massage and hydrotherapy. We were hesitant based on some of the reviews, but we found the hydrotherapist (Antionette? not sure on spelling) to be professional and caring, and the facility to be clean and uncluttered. She did answer her phone during the session and didn't seem to notice the door cracked open - she obviously has a comfort level with what she is doing that I'm sure is not shared by all of her clients, but I didn't really mind. In fact, her comfortable manner and nonchalant approach put me at ease. The language barrier was also an issue, although it opened up different ways of communicating that I found refreshing. Antionette has been doing this 26 years and seemed very skilled. The massage therapist was skilled as well.
1 Update! Still wishing I could give a ZERO STAR. So FINALLY got a call back from the director (if she even deserves that title since she sounds incompetent just like everyone else who works there) She tells me that they do not contract with Lab Corp... Who doesn't contract with Lab Corp, one of the biggest labs in the country... So anyone with Blue Cross Blue Shield should not come to this clinic if they expect labs to be sent out because they will only send them to Quest. DENISHA IS A RUDE AND NASTY "DIRECTOR" I told her the whole facility should be closed down, and her response was, "thank you so much for telling me that" and my response was f*** you and hung up! DO NOT EVER VISIT THIS FACILITY. THEY ARE SCAMMERS AND UNPROFESSIONAL AND COMPLETELY INCOMPETENT. And avoid Denisha at all costs!!!
5 Curtius and friendly staff. Always feel like the doctors listen to what my needs are. Feel like I can always trust their opinion
5 This place is awesome! All the therapists are great but last week I went in and received a massage from Emily. I went in with chronic shoulder pain and left feeling amazing. She is great for a deep/clinical yet relaxing massage! I highly recommend this place!!
2 Dr. Tsai is a pretty decent doctor and the staff is friendly, but as other reviewers have noticed, his staff screws up too much for me, so I switched and am with a doctor and staff that are spot-on.  I received strange bills in the mail over and above what medicare said I should have been billed, and once received a bill for $1.50. That was more expensive for them to bill me for that amount than it was worth!
5 Okay, I don't know why I've never heard of RMT Movement before because they've been around for years and they're literally the first place that pops up when you google 'massage Brampton'.  Anyways, thankfully my gf discovered them and recommended I try them out.  Best decision ever.  First of all, their online booking system is hella convenient.  In addition, surprise, surprise, TONS of evening and weekend options available.  They're even open on Sundays!  It's really hard to book last minute evening or weekend massages, but they're pretty flexible here.  I had booked a Saturday appointment for the first weekend in November with Leana (my friend recommended her, after a session with her), but my body was super sore I couldn't take it anymore.  I booked for the soonest weeknight, which was 5 days away.    They also have the option to fill out your pre-appointment forms online, which again, totally convenient!  When you get there, there are no forms to fill out.  Simply just have a seat and wait.  While chatting with Leana, she mentioned they had only been at this current location for about a month.  Lucky for me, this is closer to my home.  I like how they have diffusers with different oils, but I wish they would blast the mist or pour in more drops cuz I'm tryna breathe all those good scents in lol.  Anyways, Leana was great.  She got a sense of my stiffness and what was bugging me by making me do some stretches before the actual massage.  She applied a heating pad to my sore back and shoulders while she worked on my legs.  I have never had this done before.  I like when new and different techniques are introduced to me. It's totally boring when people do the same techniques over and over.  She definitely got the knots out of my shoulders.  This is what was bothering me the most.  She also smoothed out my neck muscles and I had way more mobility after.  I feel way better now and I can't wait to return in two weeks!
1 Watch the fees you will be charged.  IF you are told you are receiving a FREE consultation - think again.  This office will not only charge your insurance company but they will charge you a co-pay.  IF they had been honest from the get go that I would of been charged I would not of gone there after seeing my doctor and already paid a co-pay.  I feel this office is a complete fraud how they practice
5 I had rotator cuff surgery in November of 2012 and of course, started going to physical therapy. Chris and his staff were amazing! He got me fully functioning, and I hit and surpassed all of my benchmarks! When I was nearing the end of my physical therapy needs, I started doing fitness there and have been doing it non-stop ever since. Chris has motivated and coached me through losing 30 pounds!!! Staff is amazing, very knowledgeable, and they are stuck with me until he retires!!
5 I saw Dr. Shreder for a Class 1 medical. I received outstanding service from my initial contact with Tonya all the way through my appointment. Dr. Shreder was great and I appreciated being seen by a flying physician.
5 It is uncommon that a lais·sez-faire managerial style, an offbeat & artistic sense of style & decor and cutting-edge command of medical knowledge & expertise can combine to produce the ultimate package. Karen and her crew at MML have achieved that critical balance and the result is undeniable.
1 If you want to live, do not go here! They admitted me here after back surgery, I was to have extensive physical therapy, they didn't have physical therapy there! After a call to my insurance case worker after 2 days they transferred me to Kindred Rehab on Flamingo and Eastern. Unfortunately for me I had Contracted MERSA from Harmon. My total stay at Kindred was 73 days because I had to go back to surgery to cut out as much of infection as possible and insert a PICC line for 60 more days even after I had gone home. How this place remains open, much less licensed is beyond me!
5 Dr Austin is incredibly thorough with pt and family history. She personally spent a lot of time with me. Dr. Austin has awesome bedside manners and is very personable. This is a small well run office. Staff is also personable. Dr. Austin is a stellar example of a great doctor. I can't imagine that a patient would be turned away if they showed up in need without an appointment.
1 after confirmed via phone that they accept Crossfit drop ins they refused to sign me up since I couldn't tell them the name of the person I spoke to. They value their bonus more than letting you actually work out....
5 I have been at the Core for my hips and shoulder.  My hip doctor was Dr. Scott Siverhus.  I trust him with my life.  I had a prior hip replacement on my right hip that was arthroscopic and went through the front of my hip.  I wanted my second hip done that way and Dr. Siverhus insisted I go the traditional way for my left hip.  This meant more rehab and a lot more pain.  I'm 3 years out of surgery now and can honestly say that I'm so glad he did it the traditional way.  I have restless leg with my right let now.  I can't stand for long periods on my right leg.  I have more long term issues with my right leg in general.  Dr. Siverhus is so smart, and kind and willing to sit and talk you through things.  He knew what needed to be done and did it the right way for long term comfort.   My shoulder was Dr. Greg Nelson.  I also trust him with my life.  Because I was trying to keep my scheduled vacation and I was in tremendous pain, he worked to get me in for surgery within 2 weeks of my last visit.  My rotator cuff was torn and my bicep tendon was torn.  He did a fantastic job with the repair and although it's been a very tough recovery (as with all shoulders), he is still checking on my progress.  He sits down, talks through issues and is very personable.  I never leave the Core and Dr. Nelson with unanswered questions.   Of course you don't just see the doctors, you see x-ray techs and front desk people and PA's and surgery schedulers.   I have NEVER had interaction with anyone at the Core that was unpleasant or rude.  Everyone is so nice. They are busy because they are good.  There are a LOT of people that go to see the many doctors at the Core because they are Good!  Go with patience.  Sometimes you have to wait.  Today was a little longer than normal because the x-ray group was behind but they are worth the wait.  Trust me.
1 Had a follow up visit to get my results for a physical. Waited an hour to be called in. They took my vitals again and I said, "hey, I've already done my physical. I'm just here for results." They said that they still need to do it for this visit and I'll get my results after. I was put into a room to wait for the doctor and I waited another 15 minutes for him to come in. Went through the results and said there was a lab error on my results, but we should do the test over, "just to make sure."    Waited another 15 minutes to be called in for a blood sample and the phlebotomist does not know how to take a blood sample. First visit, she attempted to stick me in both arms and dig around to find my vein. She still couldn't get it, so she poked my hand. Second visit, I said she can stick my hand again because she probably wouldn't find my vein in my arm. She said no, she can do it. But again, she missed. And continued to poke the needle through my skin to see if she can get it. She was doing it for a good while, until I spoke up and said I was uncomfortable and would rather have her poke my hand again. I'm not sure about you, but I don't like the sight of a needle moving in and out of my skin, just so you can try and find a vein.   Then they asked me to make an appointment for next week to go over the results again. Why waste your time and my time, if you know it's a lab error? I said I did not want to make an appointment and would rather have the whole no-news-is-good-news approach.   Definitely wouldn't come back here again.  **Came back for a follow up, AGAIN. They said the earliest appointment was noon. I get here and they tell me the doctor is at lunch so I'll have to wait an extra 20 minutes, after waiting 20 minutes in the waiting room. Common sense would tell you to schedule an appointment when the doctor is available, not while he's at lunch. So now I get to sit and wait.
5 Dr. Perez is the best. Takes his time, is thorough, is compassionate, and listens! I've recommended several others here, and they have all been happy too! Also, his staff is nice too!
1 When I started seeing Dr. Nemanic I had high hopes.   He was sure he could fix me, he said he accepted my insurance, he seemed nice, and I trusted him.   Trust is a pretty important thing when it comes to patient and medical provider relations.  Unfortunately I wasn't able to keep this trust in him.   I saw him multiple times a week for a series of weeks, and saw no improment what so ever.  That does not go to say that he is necessarily to blame for this. I've never received any benefit from any Chriopractor I've ever seen. I hoped he however would be able to help me on account of his marvelous Yelp reviews, and his sureness he could help.  I stopped seeing him a few months back after I didn't quite notice any improvement from one treatment to the next/any improment over the course of seeing him.  Even though I didn't see any improvement, I kept coming back with hope that I would soon "stick" with my adjustments.  The reason I stopped seeing him wasn't even because I didn't see improement but instead because he insulted me to my face.   During one session I asked him why I wasn't able to have a specific point on my back pop ever, by anyone.  He then told me I tend to lock up when I'm being adjusted, and proceeded to ask me if I was a control freak. As I said "uhh", before giving me a chance to even answer, he smiled and said "you're a control freak".   This really left an awful taste in my mouth. Rather than suggesting ways I could relax, or telling me to try something, he flat out called me a control freak, and pinned it as the reason I wasn't able to be fully adjusted.  I have severe anxiety problems, and well, I was in pain... Naturally wouldn't one subconsciously lock up when a man twice your size is moving bits of your body around and it hurts? I wasn't knowingly doing this, it was entirely involutary.   Whether or not I am a control freak is not what is in question here, it's the fact that rather than giving medical advice or offering help, he insulted me. Neither me or insurance, were paying him for his opinion on my personality type. We were paying him for his medical services, which after months I recieved zero benefit from.   But wait, there's more.  I guess my insurance was barely paying him at all, and why's that? When I asked him whether or not my insurance plan was in network with him, he told me it was. And I trusted him. Why? Because why would anyone question it any further?  Today I got a call from his office today notifying me that I had an outstanding balance. After asking why I was told because he wasn't actually in network for ME and that every plan was different.   Hmm, well wouldn't that have been nice to know at the start of seeing him? Because honestly, had I known, I would have NEVER seen him in the first place.  I am a student. I do not have the kind of money to spend on multiple Chiropractic appointments a week, that is unless my insurance company is covering me.  This bugs me, but what really bugs me is that fact that this could have been caught after the first appointmentm, if he was billing my appointments as they happened. He could have told me, after one visit, that he wasn't covered under my insurance's co-pay.   Instead, over the course of seeing him, he insulted me, left me feeling no better, and also left me with a couple hundred dollar tab that wouldn't exist if he just checked if he was in network for me BEFORE my first visit.   He puts a whole new meaning to "adding insult to injury".
3 Zen Massage has a nice, friendly environment. I have been there 2 times--one for Reiki and one for a deep tissue massage. My deep tissue massage was great. I came out of the appointment feeling much better. I booked a 1 hour appointment, however, and my therapist started 10 minutes late. I was not reimbursed that 10 minutes, so I paid the full amount for a 50 minute massage. I was disappointed with that because I expected to get what I paid for.
5 Love this place & all the staff here! Been going here for years and I couldn't ask for a better facility with such great people especially when I'm ill and need care! All friendly and helpful... Especially Keisha and Dr. Crystal H!
1 This doctor treats his patients like cattle!  I've never felt more uncomfortable and insignificant in a doctor's office as I felt in this one!  First off, the office looks a bit shady because there are no marking even telling you it's a doctors office except for the doctors name on the glass door in small font.  So I walk in to a totally full waiting room, which is unusual in a psychiatrists office, and that makes me even more uncomfortable.  Then I sign in and pay my copay and then sit to wait.  It immediately becomes apparent that he is picking up pieces of paper with people's names and their payment receipts attached from the front counter and calling them in for 15 minute appts.  Finally 45 minutes goes by and I ask another guy in the waiting room how long the wait usually is....he tells me an hour.  At this point I have to leave to head back to work so I go to talk to the woman at the front desk and she is nowhere to be found, so I go walking through their office looking for someone.  I tell her I need to leave to get back to work and she tells me that someone will call me to reschedule and tells me there is often a significant wait.  Two hours goes by and I get a call from the office and the woman says that they will refund my copay because they don't want me as a patient.  I asked the woman why they didn't warn me about the wait and she said that a wait that long is not normal, which I know is not true.  This doctor wants to get as many patients through his office as possible with no courtesy to his patients whatsoever. It was like a cattle call!  Their customer service is also severely lacking and it took me over a month to get an appt.
5 This new facility is top notch. They offer state of the art training and rehab. They were instrumental in getting me back on the field for my 7th pro season, and got me ready for my 8th. Averill is a great therapist who does exceptional dry needle work, I've sent many other pro athletes to him and they all agree! Go check this place out if you want to take your game to the next level!   Kevin Munson
1 LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE DOUBLE BILLING AND UPCODING TO INSURANCE, WHICH IS ILLEGAL!   I had my first visit to this clinic in June for migraines, that was 15 minutes or less.  I just got a bill in the mail from PFMC that I owe them $173.79, and that my insurance only paid $26.21 for this 15 minute visit.   Luckily, I had the sense to log into my health insurance account and check the claim.  I saw that PFMC billed my insurance for a "45 minute or more" visit. This is called "upcoding," and it's highly illegal. The service they billed the insurance for is a more expensive service than what was performed.  I saw that my health insurance has a $69 discount off the $200 billed, and that my insurance paid them $104.83, and that the amount I owe PFMC is $26.21.  PFMC may say this is "just an error," but it's funny how they flipped around the amount paid and the amount owed almost exactly, so they'd get paid by the insurance company AND paid by me, and make MORE than they actually billed if I'd just paid the bill they sent me. Sure looks like "double billing," and it's also ILLEGAL.   I WILL be reporting them to the authorities and have already reported them to my insurance for this.   BEWARE SCAMMING MEDICAL PRACTICES! Check your bill against the insurance company's records.
5 I cannot express how great this place is!  I went in to get a therapeutic massage due to an old, and very painful, shoulder injury.  The therapist identified the proper trigger points immediately and spent a significant amount of time working on them.  The result ... I'm pain free!   Give this Elements Massage location (on Shea Blvd) a try!  You will be glad you did!
4 Referred to Luis/the clinic by a colleague and found it coincidentally when my RMT moved locations and into the basement of this clinic - a bonus convenience for me!   Had a great experience here feeling as though they really treated my 3 year old plus injury that I had only received limited treatment for up until spring 2015.   In 2012, I was doing a lot of walking and injured myself. I later found out that this was in fact plantar fasciatis (in my arch) and I lived with the pain for a long time (way too long). I visited a podiatrist, but was unsatisfied with very expensive orthotics given as the only treatment option. I did not carry on treatment with this doctor and instead just tried to manage the pain with regular foot rubs, using a tennis ball/water bottle to stretch it out, stretches for my calves and icing for pain as needed.   In 2014, and after over 2 years in chronic pain and not being able to withstand walking or intensive exercise (even still!), I decided it was time to try physiotherapy for the injury tried one other physiotherapist, but after 3 treatments (costing $80-90 each) I was unsatisfied with the treatment plan of icing my foot and a few stretches done by the physiotherapist and stopped that too. I thought there would be more than this having done some research on other physic treatment options for my condition. I will admit that not making time for it in my schedule had an influence on stopping treatment here but I didn't feel that the service, bedside manner and relief was worth the cost and time to get to this one.   Finally in March, I decided to make an appointment that someone had recommended and see if I could make use of my benefits over an intensive 4-6 week treatment period (going 2-3 times/week). The first appointment was quick and I found that Luis really listened to my concerns and seemed genuinely committed to trying whatever they could so I could finally get some relief. He recommended a regimen and said it would help to come 3 times a week if possible to see if I could nip it in the butt. My first treatment that day included hydrotherapy, ultrasound, heating pads, high frequency pulse(?), acupuncture, stretches and massage. I was very pleased and decided to book moreappointments for the next few weeks for 3 times a week. I spent 6 weeks in treatment with the same treatments every time and really started to notice a difference in my ability to walk long distances without pain and I needed less and less foot massages and at-home icing. After 6 weeks of intensive treatment I feel as though most of my pain is gone and I can manage it to make sure it doesn't come back through simple stretches, icing and massaging. Luis and his team really made in a difference for me and my injury - an incredibly positive outcome that I glad I finally took the time to deal with and receive the quantity and quality treatment I needed.  I am really pleased with both Luis and his two assistants. Both very personable and easy to talk to. It was nice to chat while at the appointment. When they weren't there during the treatment, they would close the curtain and turn the light off so the patient could relax. They always made sure everything felt right - right intensity, temperature. It's a very small office, but is used very efficiently as far as keeping patients moving, but at the same time, they always ensured that the right care was given and they were never hasty. Booking appointments with the receptionist was a breeze and they were always able to accommodate me.   Not even the best thing about it for me (the relief post-treatment was the best) but, a very important factor in deciding to go to this office was the rates: $70 for initial treatment and $55 for each subsequent.   Great treatment for an affordable price plus super nice and caring staff! I haven't been to many but I can't imagine what else I would need in a physic clinic. I highly recommend this office.
5 My daughter Laila has therapy here. She currently receives speech, physical, and feeding therapy. I love her physical therapist Janelle Wong. She is amazing. If we don't have her we have Matt. He is great too. She is in great hands there. We love her feeding therapist Kelly also. She has such a fun upbeat personality. We wouldn't want to go anywhere else.
5 Luca saw that I was injured on Saturday through my FB. He sent me an IM Sunday saying he had some natural pain pills and could help. He actually came to my car to see my injury to know what I needed. He then had me come back and treated me with an IV that had me feeling much better and took some swelling down on my foot. I've never had such a concerned attentive doctor and can't say enough about him!
5 This review is for Dr. Docasar  Only been there once - as you know, switching gynecologists is no fun - but I couldn't be happier, based on my visit so far. Everyone I dealt with was courteous and efficient, which I appreciate. Dr. Docasar was very polite and friendly, and we were done in just a few minutes, so very pleased. Including waiting time, meeting with Dr. Docasar, and everything else, was done in less than an hour.  The office space is nice - doesn't feel like a doctor's office at all.  Online portal is a big plus.
5 Before I moved from Arizona, I started seeing Dr Khakwani at the Phoenix location for a little while. He is, by far, the best doctor in Phoenix I've ever had. He's knowledgeable and very kind/understanding. I now have very high standards for a primary care doctor and haven't been able to find one that is anywhere close to those high standards. I've been having some medical issues recently and haven't been to his office in awhile. I called in to see if I could schedule a last minute appointment and Molly (who answered the phone) was so very VERY kind and was able to get me in while I'm in town. I cannot stress enough how great the staff is and how great Dr Khakwani is!! If anyone needs a doctor, this is the place to go and the medical professionals to see!! I honestly wish I could give more than a 5-star rating, because that's what they truly deserve!
5 I have been going to Dr. Steve for years now  for routine care and emergencies. I send all my friends, family, and coworkers to his office as well. I recently threw my back out hooking up a utility trailer and by the end of the day I couldn't even bend down to tie my shoes. Thankfully Dr. Steve was able to see me the next morning, which was a Saturday. He put me back together and come Monday I was back to work thanks to Dr. Steve and staff at Global Chiropractic!
4 Nice clean proffesional place of relaxation! Used a groupon for this place so it was a great deal. Nice open waiting area. We waited a little bit even though we made an appointment, they didn't seem to be ready for us, but it wasn't too long and they did offer us tea or water.  The rooms were clean and spacious. You change inside the room. The bedding was really soft and comfortable. Very attentive masseuse. She asked me where I had muscle pain and really did focus on those areas, unlike some other places. She really did help me release those knots, unfortunately I didn't get her name. I had the Thai herbal ball massage which was really relaxing. It's herbs and essential oils wrapped into a ball shape and it's warmed and rubbed on your back. Although its not as good as the ones in Thailand. I really enjoyed the massage and will definitely come back. Although they might need to fix the CD player, because it kept skipping.
3 Really sucks. I waited over a month for my appointment. I came in today and their is a paper on the door that their are closed this whole week. I opened the door and the lady tells me we are closed. I said I have an appointment. They said they called all patients. I was not called they had my wrong number. Now I made a new appointment and have to wait another month to be seen!!! The office didn't offer a closer appointment. They said they are so busy. I hope I get seen soon. Dr. Adams is a great doctor. Every time I see her she takes her time and really cares about her patients.
4 Wer Kieser-Training kennt, schwört darauf. Alle anderen sollten es unbedingt mal ausprobieren (gibt kostenlose Ersttraining-Angebote). Das Studio in Böblingen ist verkehrsgünstig am Elbenplatz gelegen, wenn man Glück hat, bekommt man einen Parkplatz direkt vorm Haus. Das Personal ist freundlich, hilfsbereit und korrigiert falsch ausgeführte Trainingsbewegungen. Die Räumlichkeiten und Duschen sind sehr sauber. Bei den Mitsportlern sind alle Altersklassen vertreten und keine "Schicki-Micki-Leutchen". Lohnt sich für die auch nicht, denn "Kieser" ist ohne Spiegel im Sportbereich und ohne Hintergrundmusik etc. Ein echt wohltuend anderes Fitness-Studio!
5 I highly recommend Sarah! Sarah really takes the time to evaluate you properly and explain to you wants going on and what is causing your pain. I went to her for back and should pain. I am now back to running and playing tennis pain free! I swear she has magic hands! I've been to other therapists before and they haven't been able to do what Sarah can do. You can really tell Sarah loves what she does and has mastered her craft. Thanks again Sarah!
1 Ok, this is the worst hospital I have ever been to.  Recently, around 8-9pm I finally called 911 for extreme pain and cramps I was feeling in my intestines that had not gone away for two hours. I was crying it was so painful. I had eaten some blueberries and I think that might have been it. When I arrived, I was rolled up in a gurney to the front desk where this nurse was busy typing into a computer. She said to me you will have to wait, I have forms to get done. I then sat there for a half an hour yelling in pain and nobody attended to me. They then rolled me into a room by myself and pulled the drapes around me as if I was bothering everyone. I sat in that room yelling and crying from the intense pain for at least an hour. I finally crawled out onto the floor and into the hallway because I could not take the pain anymore. The same nurse came up to me while I was on the floor in a fetal position and said "here, sign this". I said you have got to be kidding me, I am not signing anything until someone attended to me and gave me pain medication. She then said I should go back to my room because the floor had germs on it. I had to crawl back on my own. I saw other nurses and staff just walking around as if they could not hear my screams and the fact I was on the floor withering in pain. I realize there may have been others more in need than me but I swear I saw 3 elderly patients being wheeled around and they seemed calm. I finally had blood drawn and then the doctor took about a half hour before he came in and said we will give you pain medication. The doctor was just as uninterested as the nurse was. He never diagnosed anything. Nobody seemed to care except the one paramedic who brought me in and tried to comfort me after I got the pain medication, and I appreciate. When I was discharged, the same nurse said "how do you plan to get home?" I said I need a cab and she said "we do not provide that service". I did not imply the hospital had to pay, I just wanted to call a cab. I said I live on the same street Mill ave a few miles down the road. She then said I should walk home because they don't have cab information. It was 1am! Great service you guys. It was the worst pain I had ever felt and this was an emergency room. Do not go there unless you want terrible service and nurses that do not want to be bothered. Terrible for a hospital.
5 I love his studio. It's 2 on 1 with the instructors which allows for so much hands on critique which is essential for reformer Pilates. All of the instructors are so knowledgeable and personable. Great experience!
5 I am so pleased with Kids Place (their pediatric center) that I could cry! My daughter is only 2.5 and felt so comfortable and at ease with Ms. Liz! I am excited to take her to an office where even the front desk is amazing. Shoutout to Laura for making our experience amazing from the first phone call. They really do care.
5 Decided to try Arizona Medical Clinic after reading reviews on Yelp. I am so glad I did! The office staff was very friendly, and Dr. Li was fantastic! I called this morning after catching a cold last week, they were able to get me in within 45 minutes and I was in and out within a 1/2 hour. In addition to giving me antibiotics, Dr. Li also gave me some suggestions for natural remedies, which I appreciate. I would recommend Arizona Medical Clinic.
5 This is my second time with Eric and his crew, and I must say this is by far the best PT facility I have been to.  The staff takes the time to go over each of your injuries, and addresses the problem with care.   I have a fear of needles, however decided to try the dry needling that Eric specializes in. After my first session, I was amazed at how the muscles in my shoulder that had been tight for years, were relaxed!  I would recommend Physicians Physical Therapy!
5 Dr Steve does an amazing job! I've been adjusted by a few different chiropractors but never had the results I wanted until I came here! Global Chiropractic came highly recommended and now I know why!
3 Fantastic doctor. Very helpful and a great listener. His office staff leaves something to be desired. They are rude on the phone, though much better in person. They are unhelpful and curt. I am used to practices when you can have a more personal relationship with the doctor. If you have a few simple questions and do not want to book an appointment, or if you just want test results, you can call and ask for the doctor to call you back. The reception staff at this clinic is like a firewall. They don't give you any information on your own file, and they refuse to take messages for the doctor.
2 First time patient, my appt was for 8:00am I arrived at 7:50 to fill out necessary forms. I was told sign the clip board and to take a seat. Before I sat down I let them know I was a first time patient but before I was able to finish letting the reception know and she interrupted me mid sentence and told me I had 5 people ahead of me and to have a seat..Rude. I didn't get my paperwork until 8:20am and it was 6 pages long. I was asked if I had Xrays with me or do I need some taken I told the reception I don't need Xrays I'm here for a rash on my feet..she gave me my papers. Sat down for not even 5 mins and a man came and got to take me to the X-ray room. Can I say no communication..I told the man I'm not here for x-rays I'm here for a rash. So he sat me down back in the waiting room not even 5 mins later a woman came and got me and asked all these questions that should have been answered on the second on the 6 pages I still had to fill out which I wasn't even finished with first page by this time. After all of the questions about my history I was asked to once again did I take any Xrays...Grr! Really frustrated by this time. So after all the questions she sits me back in the waiting room not even 5 mins before I'm called back by a different person. 3 different people by this time!!! And the third and final person once again ask me about Xrays again. Can I say lost of communication again...Grrr! So I finally finish all 6 pages of paperwork while waiting for the doctor for 20mins. When he finally got in there he was obviously running late because he comes bursting in the room talking fast. I was asked finally what I'm there for, Now shouldn't he know by looking at the paperwork he received from the 3rd person who asked me what I was there for...So when I explained about my history regarding my feet and the problems I was having he starting to explain what he thought it could be but he wasn't sure so at this time he said he was going to look up what he thinks it could be and to see if they had pictures of the rash he looked at on my feet. He came back and told me to write down what he thinks it could be and to look it up and see if those are the symptoms that I'm having, at that time I gave him a blank stare O_O and he said Or I can write it down...Umm yeah you're suppose to do, not me...So when we were done I explained to him that his front desk has no communication and I was given the paperwork really late so I didn't get the chance to finish. And I was asked numerous times about x-ray and had to go back and forth 3 times and this up and down in the chair was very uncomfortable because I have back problems. And also I told them you have a lot of older people and they shouldn't being put thru this experience and it looks bad on him as a doctor. And he should bring it up in the next meeting or speak with the office manager. So with that being said we I left and had to check out I explain to them I will not be returning because of the experience I received. after that I called the pharmacy and cancelled my prescription and I was going somewhere....
4 A twenty minute wait at a walk-in during lunch?  Well, jeez... that's just unheard of!!!  Friendly staff, non-ancient magazine selection, young knowledgeable doctor that told me getting a whooping cough shot is basically a waste of time (I would tend to agree but its worth the poke if I can avoid an argument with my friend the newbie-mom)... and that doc must have studied really hard in poking people with a needle class.  I hardly felt a thing.  I couldn't believe how quickly I was in and out of there.  Great job guys!
1 This review is not about the actual office on W. Lake Mead Pkwy as the doctor and staff we saw were fine. The problem came with trying to get a release to return to work for my son. He was hospitalized overnight at Henderson Hospital after an emergency procedure, but since he has Healthplan of Nevada insurance with Southwest Medical Associates as his HMO insurance coverage through his employer he had to see a SMA doctor to fill out paperwork showing when he could return to work. On the initial report the doctor said he could return March 15 or sooner if he felt well enough to work.  When he reported for work Monday, February 27, he was told he had to get the doctor to submit a release to return to work. He called Southwest Medical Associates and requested that release. He was told the doctor would be notified and he'd send the fax within 24 hours. When no fax was sent the next day, Feb. 28, he called again and got the same line--it will be sent within 24 hours. On Wednesday, March 1, the same thing happened--no fax was sent and he had to call again.  On Thursday, March 2, he called and then had me call. After several calls and speaking with supervisors (different ones and different agents each time & having to replay the whole story again & again) a supervisor assured us she would contact the clinic manager and have the fax sent.  My son got a call at 2 pm that the fax was sent but he couldn't make it to work for his shift that started at 3 pm. He talked with his director and they agreed that he'd come in on Friday. Before going in he called the HR dept. to confirm the fax was there and IT WASN'T!  This time he went directly to the clinic and waited until someone would give him a copy of the fax and he took it to HR himself.  Now, of course, it was too late for his shift.  He missed a total of five days with no work and no pay all because of the incompetence of the staff in getitng a message to the doctor and getting a fax sent.  It shouldn't be that hard!
2 I really wanted to like this place; convenience of location, doctor was ok but then you have to deal with the Medical assistants. I was a patient of Dr. Hopkins, his assistants were Tina and Brandy. Dr. Hopkins wasn't bad, but wasn't amazing either. I will never again go to this office due to his assistants. Their timeliness to get back to patients is HORRIBLE! Any time I've called with an issue for a prescription it has taken a minimum of 4 days to get back to me if I'm lucky. I get a 24 hr turn  around but 4 or more days, really! Then when I brought it to her attention (Tina's) her reply was we've been having computer issues. And then instead of addressing the issue and listening she continued to flip through my chart in silence. Doctors are a dime a dozen so you would think they'd treat patients better to retain them. The search continues not only for a great doc but also a great staff...as they can really make or break it. I highly recommend looking somewhere else as this would be a last resort. I gave it two stars only for Dr. Hopkins other than that I would rate it a 1. New patients be aware.
5 We love this place! They keep track of how you like your pressure and what areas you want focused on. The 90 minute massage is unbelievable and the best deal anywhere for $48. Plus you can usually get a few dollars off if you use one of their coupons by signing up for their monthly newsletter.
5 I went in a few months ago b/c I hurt my ankle hiking and the staff was amazing. I did get skipped b/c a mom with a little girl came in and the little girl just looked miserable so it was by far the right thing to do.   They took me back had someone look at my ankle then did the XRAY on site! Which is awesome! I'm sick now and if I can come up with my copay I will be there to let them tackle this as well!  Thanks y'all for all your hard work!
2 We have been with them for years and the medical care has gotten to be terrible.  I am planning to take my entire family out of their practice and move to another office.  I have pain in my ankle all they need to go is send me a referral but tomorrow will be a week and it seems to much for them.
5 I enjoy the staff here. I love Kali! Everyone is very nice and extremely helpful. My schedule is crazy but they are always willing to work around my schedule to make sure I can get in for an appointment.
1 Place is clean for sure! They provide bottled water and packaged crackers for patients for a good reason! Service is extremely slow!!! When I say slow....I mean back office staff don't give a crap about the patients waiting patiently on the lobby while the nurses, PA, doctors and whatnots talk sit around talk as if there isn't a crowd waiting for them! It's ridiculous!!! We had a scheduled appt for 12noon! We arrived 30 minutes before our scheduled appointment....at noon we were called to just vitals then was ask to sit back in the lobby! It's 1pm and we have not been called in to be placed in yet another room to wait for either the nurse or doctor to see us! How pathetic! To think these r hard working people taking time from their weekend to sit here for hours while staff take their sweet time!!! Front desk don't greet sick people with any sympathy or worse...they sound like zombies working just to get by the day.... Place is horrible! If u r thinking of coming here.... Consider it your last resort.... Seriously!!! Had to give a star rating only for cleanliness..... And free water/snack
1 I have never met such an incompetent family practice. Avoid this place at all costs.  Let me first say that I am not disputing the medical knowledge of Dr. Sparks in any way. She seems to know what she is talking about and is well learned. But these are the only things good about this place.  My family met with Dr. Sparks once. We had to wait over 2 months for an appointment. After waiting that long, one would think they would get some individual attention. That's a negative. Dr. Sparks did not take any interested in either my wife or I personally.  Even in the follow up visit, she did not respond to any of the personal bits of information and chit chat I had during our medical conversations. She stuck strictly to the facts and didn't care about my personal medical history.  Recently, multiple people in my family have had serious illness that required attention by the Dr. We called our family practice dr, Dr. Sparks. She was unable to take time for us on any occasion. Instead, we had to meet with a new doctor hired by Dr. Sparks. Both times, we had to wait over 45 minutes to see the doctor.   This is completely unacceptable. We made freaking appointments. Showed up at least 10 minutes early. Then had to wait 45 minutes until we were able to see a doctor. There is no universe that this is acceptable.  This practice has so many operational issues, not to mention priority problems. We are finding a new practice and would advise anyone else considering Dr. Sparks to stay far away unless they want terrible customer service.
5 Dr. Alicia Myers is very talented with her hands.  In my 20 years of seeing chiropractors, I would rate her among the best of the best.  She is able to pop bones no other chiropractor has been able to in my 20 years and she does it consistently.    I've had my share of broken bones and injuries from the military days and have survived many physical therapies.  I've never seen anyone lead physical therapy as well as she does.  She does physical therapy on the whole body and not just the injured part you came in for like most places.  She does constant re-assessment of your body as well.  Dr. Alicia Myers talent is in seeing, testing, and coordinating with the physical therapist on-site.  I've been to physical therapy places and they don't compare anywhere near the effectiveness of Dr. Myers.  The podiatrist/surgeon I was seeing had recommended surgery to remove the pain on previously broken ankle.  In the first visit, she made 80% of this pain go away.  She is very good with the ankle adjustments.  I've never seen a chiropractor do that so well.  And I was already seeing a chiropractor with high ratings prior to seeing Dr. Alicia Myers but was not getting the results I hoped for.  Dr. Alicia Myers is a godsend.  Her staff from Kevin, the physical therapist, to Desirae, the massage therapist, are all very nice and friendly people.  Dr. Meyers and Kevin also have outgoing personalities.  I've never been to a place where the chiropractic and staff are actually fun and happy to be there.  Desirae does an awesome job on the medical massage too.  Dr. Myers even recommended another podiatrist from one of the top Podiatry schools in country in New York.  He was well spoken, articulate, outgoing, and most importantly knowledgeable.  Great personality for a doctor.  The podiatrist even said in his opinion, that surgery probably would not help me.  Always get a second opinion from a non-surgeon.  I found her because she was in my health insurance network.  Rates here are very reasonable for packages that go beyond the limit of what insurance covers.    My mom has numerous surgeries to relieve pain in her knees.  None of it went away but the surgeon kept on making more money from the surgeries and made more promises.  I wished I would have found Dr. Myers sooner.  I came here because I was in pain and no one else was able to help me besides "promises" from surgeons.  I highly recommend Dr. Myers before deciding on any surgeries.  She doesn't make promises but she delivers.
5 I went to Vital Care for a couple of months to help with my knees. Everyone there was so friendly and professional. I actually looked forward to having my therapy. The exercises they gave me were very helpful and yet not too difficult to do. Michelle and Kasey and Justin were all great to work with. Thanks, guys!
5 I would'nt think of going anywhere else!  Dr. Matt Tanneberg is professional, great bed side manner that puts you at ease, shows you what will be done, and comes through with great results, no pain!
2 ehhhhhhh I mean nothing was wrong with Sumit's per say it.... just.... wasnt.... my thing? Kinda weird to be honest.   I wouldnt call it "yoga", I'd say its more like "moving around in a hot room-doing the occasional downward dog-listening to the Black Eyed Peas-then saying namaste at the end" time. huh. so yeah not quite "yoga"  ugh like I want to say something nice about this place but I can't really think of anything. OOoooo they sell nice headbands in front- so theres something.   I guess I just prefer more traditional yoga over this, whatever this is....
1 I wish I had read reviews before I wasted my money going here! I made an appointment and I asked before I made it if I was going to see a doctor ? I was assured I would. I went and lo and behold she wasn't . She was a nurse practitioner!! I didn't want to be rude and walk out as I filigreed they already had my money and I wouldn't get it back so I listened and was not impressed.  I needed refills on meds which she also wanted to change one and prescribed me an antidepressant which is NOT what I went in for. I ended up flying back to my personal MD in Las Vegas and was taken care of properly .  She had a kind if all attitude which I was not impressed with.  I'll never go there again !!
5 I have seen Dr. Myers for a year now and am so greatful a wonderful friend told me about her. Dr. Myers is kind, caring, compassionate, and most importantly, awesome at her job. I have seen a couple of other chiropractors and can say with confidence that she is the best. I am a bigger girl and while Dr. Myers may look like a little lady, she can manipulate me like I'm a 90 pounds, but she does so with a gentle and respectful touch. I recently saw another chiropractor while traveling and he made me appreciate Dr. Myers and her understanding of the female body. She is very knowledgable and passes along her knowledge so I better understand my body and the cause and affects of issues I have had. She comes from a true place of wanting to help her clients and talks to them, not at them so they can learn how to better themselves. I have also had massages in the office and they are awesome! Due to my work schedule, I sometimes have to arrange an appointment the day of and the wonderful ladies who have worked at the front desk have always been able to help me. If you are in need of chiropractic help, this is the place to go.
5 We have a special needs son who is non verbal.  The staff is great with dealing with a sick child who is scared and can not explain what is wrong.   If you are looking for professional knowledgeable staff - this is the place.
5 Huge thanks to Richard and his amazing team of professionals.  I've had severe back pain since my car accident a few years back, to the point that I had to lay down and call in sick for work, if I were to work on my feet for 8 hours.  As an event planner, I need to be on my feet sometimes up to 14 hours, from set up to take down, and this physically demanding work requires a strong back....Which sadly I did not have.  Thanks to him, I'm able to successfully go to work, be it in my office for 8 hours a day planning and emailing sponsors, or at an event like TIFF.    I LOVE how they also do direct billing, which is such a relief for me.  When you are in pain, the last thing on your mind is to have to deal with the bureaucracy of insurance companies, and all of their nonsense. He truly cares for his patients success, and is not rushing you to get in and out of his office, like other clinics I've been to.  So thank you again, and I am eternally grateful to be able to live my life again with added mobility, and without constant pain.
1 I agree with a recent post. What is the point of scheduling an appointment if you're gonna have the person wait for 90 minutes or longer. That is just ridiculous might as well as told the person to just come in as a walk-in.
5 Auden Leyva at AZ Spine Disk and Sport has made it possible for this 43 year old to continue my new adventure as a member of a local roller derby team. Over years overuse- volleyball for 17 years, snowboarding (multiple concussions and neck issues) mountain biking-) my back and neck have really suffered. During my first roller derby scrimmage I got hit hard and hit the floor even harder, leading to whiplash. I though I might need to give up my silly dream. And then my friend told me about Auden. Through his knowledge and skilled care, I am mobile and a new member of the Brawlerinas RD team with AZ Roller derby. He is a miracle worker! (And super nice and funny) Thanks Auden!!
5 Doctor Montoya is a caring, and understanding doctor. He makes you feel welcome and wants to make sure you are a-ok and not stressed. He was thorough, and made my wife feel at ease. He has been in the practice for a long time and has came well recommended from not only my mother but many, many more good friends. The wait to see him might be a long one, but its worth it. Thanks for taking care of my wife Mr. Montoya!
5 I've been a patient there for about a year. I could barely walk and was in extreme pain when I started therepy. My pain was caused by stage 3 cancer, 4 surgeries, 75 external radiation and 3 internal radiation. The people at Keith Kleven Institute gave me my life back. They are understanding, encouraging, and accommodating. The Pilates with Julie and Lisa is the most helpful to target my painful and target areas. Sou is an amazing PT listening to my complaints and concerns,  and adapting daily to what will help me heal me and get back to and Normal life.   I am forever grateful to everyone at the keith kleven Institute for helping in my recovery
5 I received great treatments from Dr. Eric Hefferon a number of years ago and have had no problems with that issue at all.  Over the past year, I developed a different pain and a lack of range of motion that was not getting better.  It was also interfering with my ability to practice yoga.  I finally decided to get some help and once again turned to Dr. Eric Hefferon.  I was really impressed from the moment I walked into his practice now at Impact Physical Therapy.  Dr. Eric Hefferon and Dr. Tami Hefferon with Dr. Dave Balzer and Kelcey Bates have created a healthy and happy environment that balances professionalism, friendliness, individual attention, positive vibes and expertise!  The initial treatment I received from Dr. Tami Hefferon and Dr. Dave Balzer provided immediate improvement and pain relief.  I was truly amazed!  I look forward to my visits for the expert treatment they provide as well as for the wonderful atmosphere they all create.  Stop by for a visit, make an appointment, and see for yourself!
1 After so many great reviews, I tried calling but the voicemail was not "setup"...so I emailed with no response....I am writing this 2 weeks later and have still not heard anything....this maybe a good masseuse but I like the ones that actually book massages!
1 This has turned into a nightmare! Doug, the Dr.. Thats why im not calling him a Dr..... He dont deserve the title or reconigation. Hes rude and disrespectful, as i have him recorded raising his voice at me... and my mom, which will never happen again!!  So DOUG!  Doesnt give 2 fs about his employees treating patients like shit. He dont want to hear it... Nor do they want to hear that Henry violated a HIPPA law, and violation against me.. as he is in the gay scene and im not, although another patient and someone who is in the gay scene advised me Henry is telling people in the gay community about my medical health details.. WHich caused me damages, and a law suit to persue since the so called manager Kim did not take this seriously.. ! ALso against the most incomepetent "manager" Kim Titus. Who claims she called me, but records from my phone company do not show that... SHe also refuses to submit my papaer work since mid April to Liberty Mutual which are legal binding doucments. Therefore she also will get complaints for not taking care of Henry and violations against the law.... and just because Doug sits on the medical board, after I complained aganist Henry, I was threatened with that.... Kim  is the most ignorant "manager" ever!!!!! She does not know how to do her job ethically. She rude and a bitch!  I have her recorded many times, as Doug to, and Henry sitting at the front desk gossipping with the obeased witches. Its like a 3rd world country... If you want to be so presitge since you sit on the board and THINK your untouchable, think again! There are so many others WAY ABOVE YOU ALL... at dosposal! We all have friends in low and high places..   First as a "DR" I would make sure my office manager is doing her job, and that patients are being treated well and fairly. BUT THEY DONT! They all treat you like shit! Unless your fucking Henry, than your ok,   They want to get you in the office just to sit for 2- hours and bill the insurance a high CPT code... as I discovered. And since Kim refuses to submit my paper work, her too will be followed up w a law suit, and especially if I lose my job due to her incompetency.... Everyone, and things, calls, visits all recordings and videos are on file!!!  From the guy who told me what Henry is doing, to Kim, to Robert, front desk bitches to Dr. Serroni, and Doug...And Henry being selective on what gay guys to be the nurse to as I and others are Dougs patients too... But resuses to be my nurse now we know why, cause hes a gossipping lil queen who will be charged fairly..   In addition, as my authorization is on file, Kim still refuses to speak to her.. and other violation!  Also, as being a Dr.... I would also be worried about himself... Like being so fat, unhealthy and not fit... "bear" or not.. Cloresterol, diabties, heart, just very unhealthy.  How you you practice but not what you preach!.  Kim, She will be fully investigated and suits to follow.
1 I came to see someone who was in the emergency room. They needed water so I walk up to the nurses station. Everyone there ignored me. No joke. I stood there for over 5 minuets without any type of assistance or acknowledgement. This older lady with short hair kept making eye contact with me but wouldn't stop her story telling of how she cashed out her retirement from some other place she worked at and how she needs to make more money, at least six figures. Sorry lady. With that piss poor attitude, you don't deserve it. I would have even been ok if she would have said "I'll be right with you, I'm almost done telling this super boring story that no one cares about, except me" Fine. At least that was honest. I can live with that.  Finally, a security guard asks me if I need anything and he'd be happy to get the water for me. Unbelievable. He went above and beyond because the nurses here suck. Nice to know retirement stories are more important than taking care of patients. I called the lady out for her rudeness and she told me "I'm sorry, I didn't see you had anything in your hand" whaaaaa?! But you saw me standing there, right?!   I wrote the above paragraph before we noticed that the bed he was laying on had someone else's blood on it. Called it to the nurses attention and they tried to downplay this gross hazardous negligence. They originally wanted to just call housekeeping to just wipe it off. Umm...no. I called the head nurse in and she had this 'yeah, it's our bad, what do you want us to do about it' attitude. Said it was just an oversight on their part. Kinda got a little combative. I asked for a number to file a complaint because this is not ok for anyone to have to be treated under this type of conditions and to just be so cavalier about it. Sorry. It's not like you forgot to bring someone their water, it's blood. Someone else's blood. After I asked for a number to file a complaint, the attitudes shifted and became more of a please don't report us. This place needs to really get with it. This is how horrible mistakes can happen. Someone's safety is in jeopardy.   If you can avoid this place, do so. There are far far better places to seek help at. Places where they care about people. This place falls short. Very disappointing.
1 I am pretty sure Danielle was the lady that tried to get me not to leave AMA.  I am not sure. But I thought everyone was ok until my last night!  I did think it was strange I got admitted for a dog bite but who knows that could have been appropriate but I did not trust the er dr at all he was a schmuck that was beyond full of himself.  But all the ER nurses were so funny and making me happy I totally dealt with it.   Then I got moved upstairs and got the most awesome people ever so I thought this might not suck so bad.  When the night kept sucking they were making it soo better for me. Same thing in the morning and as horrible the food is the people will totally try to make it better for you if you just ask. Also my dr was pretty awesome you do not really see them much though!  Which is why I forgot.    Up until then I was thinking as freaked out as I am that I am here this place is freaking awesome. Then i found out from the lab chick who needs to draw my blood for the rest of my life because she is the mostest awesome person ever that part of the hospital is for criminals. (which would really never bother me) until there was some criminal party that made it weird for actual patients!  There were a ton of cops with prisoners going on after they moved patients to different rooms to do this.  Then i realized why people shut their doors!  I had every weird sheriff joe cop looking at me  like they were the shit. It went on for hours and then I personally lost my shit.  I called for some water and cracker because my stomach was really bad and 40 mins later no response because I am assuming prisoners are more exciting as me.  I pulled of my IV and tried to get someone to take the needle part out.   That sucked too. They made me go back upstairs and offered me a bunch of drugs to stay there. I said no take all this crap out of me and said give me an AMA to sign so I can  leave!!!!  She actually gave it to me but i could hear her trying to figure it out for what felt like forever!  And it looks like they gave me vaccines I said not too!  I have to go in there to find out!
1 Been with them 15 years and WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THEM TO ANYONE. I asked for my medication to be switched to extended release, I felt it was not the right medication for me. The reply I got was extended release is more expensive than immediate release. Last time I checked I wasn't at a Fidelity appointment I was at Dr appt. If you feel that you would like to sit on hold for 5 to 20 min to get appt or just to talk to someone this is the place you should go or wait 2 to 3 months to get just a routine appointment this place is for you. Cindy is rude and dis respectful and all you are is a number not a patient it reminds me of the DMV office take a number and wait. Wouldn't recommend this place to a ant or mosquitoe. Completely in it for your money and insurance money not for you as a patient. Hope this helps with your decision.  If I could give a 0 or half star I would
5 I was in such terrible sciatic nerve and lower back pain that walking and standing became a serious problem.  Grigor was recommended to me by one of his clients and I am very thankful that I made the appointment.  The sessions of deep muscle work have helped me to walk and exercise pain free.  I'm even golfing again.    Grigor is accomplished and very knowledgeable about his craft.  With a clean facility and a great personality, I would highly recommend Grigor to anyone looking to get out of pain.
1 I wish I could give them a zero, or a negative number for a score. This is the worst place to go, save yourself and find a real doctors office. I was a former patient of Dr Palmer and was very happy there. I moved back to AZ and found out Dr Palmer was no longer there so I was set up with Dr Brewster. I called and specifically asked for an appointment for a physical exam, with labs, fasting, for both me and my husband. After my visit I got a huge bill from my insurance, the visit and the labs were not covered because they were billed as an anxiety visit. I have tried to sort it out with them but they insist it was not a physical, even though that is what I scheduled, and the labs were done for the physical and the Dr and I talked about the visit being a physical. The billing department never calls you back and now I am just stuck with a $600 bill. Fine, I live with it. But now it is 6 months later and my insurance company asked me to get a form filled out with that lab work, which I  paid $600 for, and the Dr refused to sign it unless I schedule an appointment, so he can bill me for it. Of course the office manager never called me back to discuss it. Dr Brewster has a terrible bedside manner, he seems like he could care less about you when you're there. I didn't like him when I thought the visit was free. Furthermore, my husband has had ridiculous problems getting his meds refilled, for the last 3 months, they are only calling in 1 month at a time and the pharmacy will wait a week to hear back from them while he runs out of meds. When he calls the md office, no one calls him back either. DO NOT GO HERE! you could die waiting for a callback.
5 This is the best office for PT and chiro I could ever imagine.  I have gone for minor aches and pains off and on for a long time.  They know the body and can really help you maintain a healthy activity level.  Then when I really hurt my should and a regular doctor referred me for shots or to ortho carolina for a MRI, the physical therapist, Katie  put me back in working order prescribing exercises and explaining what was really going on so I could understand and work to maintain functionality over the long run despite a torn tendon.  She also has helped me correct a knee issue with exercises strengthening the core and buttocks.  They are all amazing doctors and can really help work the body issues out, I trust them fully!
5 I highly recommend everyone to come to this facility. They have more than one Doctor as well as services other than Chiropractic. Dr. Loth is great with all of my special sports injuries. You can tell that he is very knowledgeable and he cares for our health. The staff is great and would love to get a massage in the near future.
1 Unbelievable cash grab...  Visited this urgent care for a persistent cough and ended up having them run every test possible on me....  Whether needed or not....  Ended up billing my insurance for thousands of dollars...   To make matters worse, the arrogant, nasty, doctor actually went to lunch while I was waiting to see him, this resulted in the nurse coming into the room and apologizing for his behavior and making us wait needlessly...  I do not recommend this place...
5 Dr. Cleary is a wonderful doctor who listens and understands. I can't always make it to my appointments because of my medical condition so I cancel at a moments notice. I had my case manager ask how they would handle this since I was dropped by another doctor who didn't care why I was missing appointments. I have had no problems when this happens so I am very thankful to everyone who works here. The girls are friendly and seem to always be working and not talking like at other places. I recommend this place.
5 Easy paperwork, fast waiting times and the doctor was really nice. Plus my copay was incredibly low, the only downside is they're closer to my work than my house! But they're worth the extra miles.
5 Dr. Fakhouri is awesome. A doctor that takes the time to listen and truly cares for his patients. He is very knowledgeable and professional.
5 Thorough is the first word that comes to mind! Personable, caring....  she takes the time to spend with her patients to make sure all of your questions are answered AND you understand what she has told you.  One time I did have to wait for a bit in the exam room.  I was kind of getting huffy (I hate to wait and that's so NOT like this office)  She came in very apologetic and explained an emergency came in and she had to spend the time - she explained, something she would also do with me - and all of her patients.....   can't really fault that! She also is the first doctor of the 3 I have gone to who has been able to diagnose my symptoms and she sent me to a specialist. An added benefit is having the lab "in house".  Thanks Dr. Gibson for all that you do!!
1 This place is a joke! Rude customer service and no one listens! Dr Shanholtzer was extremely rude, fast, (like its a drive thru service or something) and horrible bedside manner! After two hours of waiting I got maybe 30 seconds with him. He told me to pick one symptom to be treated and go back out sign in and get the other symptom treated as separate visit! Which was super aggravating, because one of the reasons I was there was for an issue they didn't fix the 1st time two weeks ago and was still unimproved and lingering! Then they gave me a prescription that is making me nauseated and when I called to ask them for something else that wouldn't upset my stomach they told me to come in for another visit, which would cost another $40 copay, no guarantee the Dr would adjust the script, and probably another two hour wait to not be treated properly!
5 I made an appointment with Dr. Milne for my son after visiting several pediatricians over the span of 7 years in search of someone who actually had the knowledge and insight to help our son.  After reading the other negative reviews, I almost cancelled the appointment two days prior - thank god I didn't!  After a very long journey, I feel that we finally are going in the right direction.  Dr. Milne is not your conventional doctor, so if that is what your looking for, go elsewhere.  If you want help treating the problem rather that getting a prescription to cover up the what is really the problem, go see him!  Keep your mind open.
1 I was EXTREMELY Disappointed in the way my visit went with the doctor there.  I had came in with severe ear pain in my right ear. She first began examining my left ear and I kindly reminded her that my pain was in my right ear in case she read my information wrong. Being extremely rude, she looked at me and told me she knows how to do her job. As I began asking questions about my situation throughout the appointment, she answered my questions with attitude as if my questions were stupid. At one point she looked at my mom who was also in the room and asked her, "you understand what I'm saying don't you?" I felt she had no compassion for her patients.  She interrupted me multiple times and also didn't explain herself well whatsoever. On top of that, towards the end of my horrific visit, she held the doorknob as she talked to me and began to proceed out the room without giving me a chance to ask another question (Which I did have). My mom and I were waiting for some camera guys to come out and tell us that some kind of prank had been pulled on me. NEVER WOULD I  RECOMMEND THIS URGENT CARE!
5 I have been going to Gilbert Physical Medicine for years. Great staff, Cole is awesome! I started going after having some issues with my back, and Dr Wasserman was able to help me feel immediate relief. I now go for regular maintenance adjustments. They offer a wide variety of services- massage, physical therapy, they have nurse practitioners that are able to diagnose and prescribe medications - this has helped when I was sick and couldn't get into my normal doctor's office. I have also received their trigger shot therapy. I was a bit scared at first, but it really works!
1 This place is garbage and their doctors are garbage too. Two different doctors haven't been able to do anything for me but send me huge bills...thieves.
1 I would not wish a visit to this facility on my worst enemy. Over 4 hours of waiting for a SCHEDULED APPOINTMENT. Even worse, it has not been a one-time occurrence. I would rate 0/5 stars if possible. Did I mention the horrendous bedside manner? The bedside manner leaves much to be desired.
5 Always able to get in same day! Staff is always really nice too! Location is convenient as well! Definitely recommend!
1 Sunday morning, told a 1-2 hour wait. Ended up being 2 hours like they said but spent another hour in room waiting to see doc. Nurse said a few minutes after taking my sons vitals! Once he was seen, had to wait another 40 minutes to get script written. Nothing like spending 4 hours at the urgent care on a Sunday morning for a ear infection. Never again.
5 My family has being going to Dr. Ross for as long as I can remember. He genuinely cares and is quick to tell you exactly what is going on and what you can expect for recovery. We are a relatively healthy family, but when we have gone to see Dr. Ross, he has never steered us wrong!
4 I've been going to this Medical Centre for over 10 years and it's absolutely brilliant. Great service, from staff answering telephone calls quickly to the general care. I have no complaints.   There are two seperate practices, each with their own reception. I'm registered with Dr. Tolley's practice and he has been nothing but helpful and understanding. Sadly this week when I popped in I saw a note saying that he is retiring from the practice in a few weeks time. He definitely deserves his time off but then I wondered who will take care of me now? Of course, I've seen other doctors at the practice as well and they have been just as competent. If you need just a blood test for e.g. blood pressure / cholesterol tests you may request an appointment with one of the nurses.
5 Footprints Therapy is probably one of the best Osteopathy clinics in Toronto. I have been seeing Samara for my back and disc issues. Cannot say enough good things about her. She explains to me what is going on, what needs to be done and what I must do going forward. And after our treatments I actually feel different. What I like best about Footprints is they have very experienced Osteopaths which for me is a must. As I am still in rehab I hope to be back up and running (so to speak) soon! For now I know I am in the most capable of hands. Highly recommend if you are looking for this kind of treatment.
4 The Good: Dr. Hatchell is amazing.  Professional and takes time to listen. Highly recommend him.  I enjoy going to this doctor's office.  They are convenient and generally run on time.  The extended hours are also a real blessing.    The Bad: The older front desk lady can be a bit rude on occasion, but sadly I just really overlook a lot of medical office staff as it seems to be a job requirement that admin staff not enjoy their jobs and fail to see patients as their customers.
1 Was contacted by manager stating they had "changed" their Valentine coupon policy but still makes no sense to make your clients come into the spa to get a gift card and then have to return to use it at a later date - would be nice to call, make appointment and let them know you are using their email coupon and then just present it at time of appointment - no extra trip required.
1 I do not recommend this facility. The gym is a free for all and the doctors/employees do not spend one on one time with the patients to make sure that they are performing their exercises and stretches corectly which can cause a re injury or worsening of their condition. Dr. Vogel only seems to care about money and not the well being of the patients.
2 Overall Dr. Yee as a person...Wonderful. She's kind, joyful and gets to know you and makes you feel comfortable. But the list for the pros are short...very short. Now let's move on to the cons... 1. Arrive on time for your appointment....you will wait 2 hours before being called to be seen. 2. Once placed in a room....you will spend another hour and a half listening to Dr. Yee talk to other patients about their vacations and such. 3. Dr. Yee enters the room....after spending a hour and a half waiting...you now get to spend a very rushed 8-13 min visit with the Dr....she has a business meeting for lunch...not much time to listen to why you are here today. 4. Scheduling.....often overbooked. Staff sometimes forget to call you to say your appointment has been changed. You have to wait months to see Dr. Yee for an issue that you are having today. 5. Staff.....always rushing, not pleasant when greeting patients as they check in. Can be heard talking about the patients and what they believe the patients issues are (maybe if they stuck in there and furthered their education beyond the MA certificate....).... 6. Lab results...you can't get them in a timely manner because Dr. Yee is always on VACATION.  GOD forbid that I tested positive for something that would reduce my lifespan....I would spend the remainder of my life not knowing what I had or being treated for it because she's on vacation.  Maybe a backup plan should be utilized in her office.  1.Have a qualified PA to stand in for her when she becomes too busy or is away on vacation.  2. Retrain the staff in areas of privacy and customer satisfaction. Grouchiness, rudeness, always being rushed or being made to feel unimportant will only drive patients to seek another Dr. 3. Ask the patient what the issue is so that when the appointment is being scheduled the correct amount of time can be allotted per patients issues or concerns and it reduces overbooking. 4. Select one individual to take the refill appointments for the day. It will reduce wait times for patients that are only getting refills as well as keep the small waiting area uncrowned. That individual can can assist with patients once the refill patients have been attended to.
5 Every time I come in I cal first to check if they're busy.   I've come three times in three years and consistently they are quick and effective.
1 Not good, very short therapy sessions for stuff you can just do at home. I suppose it depends on what exactly your treatment plan is, but beware of them rushing you in and out just to collect your money.  Check with your orthopedist too. Mine said "yeah you can just do your excercises at home". But would they tell you that? Heck no because they want your money!
5 These guys are great. So helpful and caring. I was impressed by their level of commitment and compassion.
5 I wanted a few visits with Queensridge and Dr. Hisana Qamar (pronounced KAYMAR) and her staff before I gave my opinion/review. I think she is one of THE BEST doctors I've ever been to. She seems to be very intuitive and has shown much compassion towards me as a patient. Ive had some health challenges and she actually listens. She seems to know exactly what you'll need to get well. Her goal is to get you well and keep you that way. She has provided information on health and nutrition that I do my best to follow.  I am genuinely grateful to have her as my PCP. Im glad my company added her to my Direct Care Plan just as I was about to give up looking for a doc on that plan.  The office is wonderful. Its very clean and the waiting area decor is not that of a typical doctors office. There is no "clinic" feel whatsoever.  More like a living/sitting room with comfy chairs and art on the walls (and a few well deserved accolades). Water is sometimes offered on warm days.  Samantha is the first smiling face to greet you when you walk in. She is soft spoken, polite and very genuine. She will be the one that takes your vitals before you see the doctor.  Id recommend this office to anyone looking for a practice and doctor who doesnt treat you like a number but a person.  5 STARS all the way!
4 My husband and I are new patients here. We are very happy with the quality of care we have received already. Dr. Panesar and PA Perkins excellent.
5 Best deep tissue massage i ever had! It,s going to hurt, but feel so good afterward. Got full body adjustment too, no need to go chriopractor.  Jim the man!
5 Live well, take care of your body. When you get hurt, injured or years have taken their toll, the only place to go fit repairs/physical therapy is the Fischer institute. Brett, K2 and the team are absolutely the best at their craft. I've trusted them to keep me moving pain free for the past half decade. Bravo to Brett and the contribution his team makes yo the wellbeing of the community b
5 I've never met a masseuse who has the the physical strength and the knowledge of how the human body works on ALL levels. I see Laura every time I come to Las Vegas or she comes to LA. I know when I have a session with her, I come out of there not only with less kinks in my body, but completely rejuvenated mentally and spiritually, too. My line of work is hard on the body so to all athletes: Laura is your girl! And to all non-athletes, Laura is nurturing on so many levels.
5 I am going to this office in 2 weeks I used to go to the old location now it's ore convenient because it's close to my job their office staff are nice and didn't have any trouble the astonishing time I went to this new location and Dr gibson is nice
5 I have been a patient of Dr. Goldman's for several years now. I couldn't be happier with the care and concern I have received over the years! I am grateful for the extra time she spends with me to explain any newly prescribed medicines or how we are going to work as a team to solve any of my health issues. I cannot imagine anyone being unhappy with ANYONE in this office unless they arrived at their appointment in that unhappy state of mind to begin with!
5 I called Dr. Boothe and left a message late on a Tuesday evening @7:58 . On Wednesday @ 7:58 am  Dr. Boothe  returned my call personally. He fit me in @ 11:30 am . I am not his patient , in fact I am from Rhode Island on vacation but he  made a point to see me ! All the kind thought full words said about Dr Boothe on yelp are well deserved he is a true professional and a gentleman . It was the best Chiropractic adjustment I have ever had with out a doubt .  Thanks Dr. Boothe it was a pleasure meeting you ! Jim t
5 I went to Rebalance Sports Medicine after I suffered a phlebotomy injury during routine blood work. The technician at the blood clinic injured a tendon in my arm and ruptured a vein. I had serve swelling, bruising and I lost the ability to straighten my arm, rotate my wrist, and my grip strength was significantly impaired.   I sought out physiotherapy at Rebalance Sports Medicine clinic approximately two weeks after the injury to regain mobility in my arm and wrist, as well as restrengthen my arm and grip strength. The physiotherapist that worked with me, Orsi, was extremely knowledgeable and provided me was a lot of valuable information throughout the healing process. I saw Orsi weekly for approx 8 weeks until my arm was completely healed. Orsi used a number of different therapy methods as the injury continued to heal. Each week I was provided with stretches and activities to ensure that my arm healed and I regained full functioning and mobility.   I had a lovely experience every time I visited the clinic, it was clean and all of the equipment was up to date. I greatly appreciate the professionals working at this facility. I would have been 'in the dark' through my healing process without the valuable insight and hands on treatment from Orsi.
5 I'm so glad I found this studio.  I feel like it's my new home.  I always feel welcome here, like I'm part of a family.  I have loved every instructor here.  Each has their own style but I still feel pushed in a positive way and I've really progressed here.  They are super friendly and always greet me by name, even after having only met me once.  And the same goes for the other students.  Friendly, non-competitive, encouraging and helpful.  The studio is large and there is always plenty of room.  I like how I can choose the extremeness of the heat as one side of the room is hotter than the other.  Don't get me wrong.  It's hot.  Just that one side has the humidifiers on it and it can be REALLY hot near them.  The room has good air circulation and it doesn't get too stuffy and I feel like I can breathe.  Bikram yoga is the only exercise I've found that I can really stick with.  Even with working 12-hour shifts I can find the time.  I don't feel right unless I go.  It gives me a clearer mind, clearer skin and clearer sight.  I have more energy and I only feel like eating healthy foods.  I sleep better and have less back pain.  I only wish I had started a long time ago, but as Bikram says, "You're never too old, never too bad, never too late and never too sick to start from the scratch once again."
5 Love this dentist! Ive had so many problems with dentists before, so going to this one was by far an amazing experience. Got my wisdom teeth pulled with no issue, and was able to function normally after. Loved it!! Will be my permanent dentist from here on out.
5 I can't say enough good things about Physiotherapy Associates and everyone there, especially my therapist, Koreen. Koreen started there within the last couple months. She is a gifted therapist who has an intuitive understanding of the body.   I started PT after a major wreck left me carless and in a lot of pain. I've never done PT before and didnt know what to expect.   I haven't been the kind of person who looks forward to working out, but found myself eagerly attending PT a few times a week. You just have to break through that post-workout fatigue of the first 6 weeks. Exercising with pain can be discouraging, but stick with it. After getting past that, I found myself with a higher level of energy that I still have all the time. If something hurts, they don't force you to do it, and they customize your plan every month or so after reevaluating your progress and level of pain. The therapist I had for the first month ended up leaving to continue his education, and even then, if Koreen saw me doing an exercise with bad form, she would come over and show me how to do it correctly. I GREATLY appreciated that she cared enough to help me. She painstakingly explained things to me and answered all my questions.   Though I went there for pain, it's unavoidable to not learn about the rest of your body in the process. They left me with a better understanding of core muscles, what muscles being lengthened and shortened can do, an appreciation for exercise, a newfound respect for posture, and most importantly... a big reduction in pain. I felt sad to leave because Koreen and everyone else there have changed my life!
5 This place rocks! They take a look and tell you what's going on and how that's affecting your daily life, very informative, the doctor is so knowledgeable and the staff is the friendliest. They take such great care of you. They loosen up your muscles with a quick massage which makes the adjustment go great and even have a massage chair while you wait :)
5 Visited my mom here after she fell, everything they do here they do well.  It is a beautiful facility, the staff are friendly and attentive and they provide safe care.
5 Outstanding chiropractic services with great customer care. Thank You Dr. MIKE AND STAFF ... A regular patient that feels 100% better.  Congrats on your new location off of Dobson Rd. Just around the corner from your old office.  Plenty of room at the new facility :-)  John and Diana
5 After surgery to reattach a bicep tendon, ARIS was the only place on the west side that my surgeon trusted to do the rehab. I have been going three times a week for 2 months and the progression has been excellent. Always on time, usually if arrive a few minutes early are whisked in right away. Al and the staff are very knowledgable. Tip: if coming from the 101 use Union Hills then south on 67th way quicker than Bell
5 Pain solutions has really helped with my lower back pain. I wanted an alternative to help with my back pain instead of being on prescription pills. They're awesome and helped me more then I can thank them for. Very modern and friendly as well you actually feel like they care about there clients. They also accepted my insurance and helped with co pays!!
2 Don't use your credit card here lest you want an employee to embark on an online shopping spree at your expense.
5 This is a beautiful new location for Dr. George, having blood work due and scheduling a couple months, his schedule has been full with all the reno and what not. I felt lucky to get in to see him.   The same friendly staff are here as well as some new faces. The office is shinning, new and refreshing. I like the new logo, 'Health and Wellness'. And it's private concierge practice!   Had only blood work today but was right in and out. Parking is plentiful right at the door, go back next week to see Dr. George and get my results and meds renewed.   Contragulations on the new office! Looks fantastic. Cannot wait to see how service is, once the office is up and running full speed.
5 I am very thankful to have Irina as my massage therapist for many years. Irina takes a holistic and individualized approach to massage. She regularly does research to provide me with relaxation techniques and exercises that target my specific problem.  She has also referred me to many other health professionals. As a full time student for many years, I have many trigger points and muscle tension. Irina targets the specific areas with deep tissue massage and I feel a lot of relief. God bless her!
1 There seems to be something shady going on here.  I came for a work physical and was told there would be a 2 hour wait.  After the 2 hour wait, I was called to the counter and was told that I can now be added to the wait list and that it would be 2 hours more.  They seem to be pulling a "VA" to show shorter waiting times to companies that use them.
4 I went in for a drug screen fairly early in the moring with a few people ahead of me, signed in filled out the paper work. The person that signed me in wasn't a morning person but she delt with me fine because neither am I. I was in the waiting room approx 10 mintes at the most and was called in for the drug screening and was taking orders like I was in boot camp until she realized that I was not a morning person. There were no staff in there so she had great interest in completing my task and geting me out of there. I have to say I was in and out in about 30 minutes and all ended well
1 The lady at the front desk was nice and helpful.  After that, everything went down hill.  I waited in a waiting room for almost 1 1/2 HOURS to be seen by the physician's assistant.  At the 1 1/2 hour mark, I up and left.  NO RESPECT FOR PATIENTS TIME.  How can you be that busy that ever after 1 1/2 hours, you are still not seen?  Won't be back!  A little advice, have a little respect for your patient's time and don't keep them waiting over an hour.  Ridiculous!
5 Dr. Dye is an expert, experienced chiropractor who always makes you feel better the second you step foot in his office. He's fun, practical and we trust him with our entire family's care. It's very clear that he loves what he does and genuinely cares for his patients. The staff is wonderful and this is a great local and family-owned business!
5 I am very impressed with Damon.  He spent almost two hours with me, correcting my posture and discomfort I had been having in my shoulders and low back.  I highly recommend him to anyone that is having pain.  Damon is very professional and is clearly experienced in treating athletes that are in pain.
1 My first impression was not a good one.  Today I had an appointment and was unsure of the time.  I called over and over again and could not get anyone to answer the phone.  Finally, I clicked the selection as if I wanted to set an appointment and a person came on and said 1:30 PM but she is running one hour late so take your time.  I came in at 2:15 and there was a line to sign in.  By 3:30 I was still waiting.  I noticed a person that came in after me was called in.  I went to the counter...and the nurses were talking amongst each other.....waited for someone to acknowledge me to no avail.  I turned around and left the office.  This was a major waste of my time as I made this appointment a month ago and this was the first date she was available.
1 I went in there sicker then a dog was not even in the back for 15min in tears the PA was quick to rush his diagnoses and only gave me a prescription for a ear infection even though a lot of other things were bothing me did not even bother to listen to me just jumped to a quick conclusion  and sent me on my way I knew better and my husband was also not happy with his diagnosis  and knew he was full of crap and we just went to the ER where they told me I did not have an ear infection and told me urgent care was wrong shocker there avoid this place at all cost they seem to want to get people in an out quickly no matter if there wrong or right.
2 The massage was ok, worth the price of the $35 introductory special. The room was cold, there was a fan blowing the entire time, and the ceiling in the room had brown spots. The bed was also cold; I prefer when there are warmed beds and warmed lotion. Also, the receptionist wasn't overly friendly; she didn't ask how our massages were and didn't really make eye contact. I have been here before, so I'm surprised that I didn't have a great experience.
1 I've been a patient here for years but I'm fed up after today. I took time off from work to keep a 2 pm appointment for which I arrived 15 minutes early. At 2:20 I was still sitting in the waiting room and asked what was the problem; I was just told the PA would see me soon. A few minutes later I was shown to an examination room, but nobody ever showed up there. At 3:05 I gave up and left. I was never offered an explanation, let alone an apology, for not being seen more than an hour after my scheduled appointment. If this were the first time this had happened, I would shrug it off, but it's become the rule rather than the exception with this place. I took my wife there recently because she was suffering from a painful condition, and I think we waited about two hours past our appointment time to see a doctor.  I'm a professional myself, and I know the right and wrong way to treat a client.  Until coming to FDGV I had always seen an MD.  I was willing to see a physician's assistant because I thought I would get better service and more attention. Clearly that is not the case. They are just stacking up patients to maximize their fees, without any respect or concern for the patients. I'm in the market for another doctor, starting now.
5 I work for East Valley Hospice and we use Wellsprings from time to time for GIP. We have always had an excellent experience with their team and think the facility is beautiful, peaceful and clean.
5 Dr. Bauer had great reviews and so did the facility so this is ultimately why I chose to come here. I haven't had a primary in over 2 years I think and need a referral to an ENT so I decided that I needed to develop a relationship with a Dr. and maintain it since I plan on being here for a while.  The facility is right down the street from my house so nice and convenient. It is HUGE but they have a map at the entrance of the parking lot. When you walk in, you are immediately greeted by the girls at the front desk. They promptly take your information and have you sign the remaining paperwork if you didn't finish it online. You then wait for another lady to take your co-pay. From what it seems this office runs like a well oiled machine, but I thought it was interesting that the woman was copying the co-pays on paper in an old fashioned receipt book. It didn't take long, so I don't really care, I just would have figured since they have online technology for their patients that they would have something for themselves.  Anyway, a nurse came and got me and did the whole vitals thing and checked height and weight and what not and then I was placed in a room to wait for Dr. Bauer. It took her about 5 minutes and she was in and introducing herself, reviewing my paperwork and talking to me about me. She was really nice and straightforward which I liked - down to business. Please don't take it for her being impersonal because it isn't, shes a busy doctor and wants to give you the best focus she can and I like that.  She checked me out and everything was fine as I knew and she also quickly gave me a referral for an ENT in the same building and had me request my old records. For a first time visit, this only took 45 minutes which was less than I was expecting.  Dr. Bauer and the staff are great and I hope when and if I need anything more serious I can prove them right even further as to how good they are. Hopefully that's not the case but I can already tell they will be awesome.
1 I've seen her for 1 year now. Not good. Wait time is ridiculous. What is the point of making an appointment if your going to get seen 1 hour later. The staff are young inexperienced girls. Don't bother calling or leaving a message for a call back. The doctor is nice but the concern about my health does not seem genuine. She left me clueless about a health concern I had. Not good, looking for a new primary care.
5 I had an Hydrotherapy session for the first time some time ago and it was one of the most amazing experiences I have ever had. So relaxing, different and much better than any other therapy or relaxation experience I had in the past. My body was totally relaxed and pampered, my mind flew to a different world...  I would definitely recommend it to everybody :) I also got one of the MARGOA's Hammock, they are totally awesome !
5 I had been without a doctor due to retiring, moving, but primarily dissatisfaction with my former PCP.  I was also done with the antiquated process of waiting up to an hour past my scheduled appointment before my PCP would finally burst into the exam room only to rush through my concerns before he was gone...within 10 minutes of entering the exam room.  I was DONE!  As I searched for and researched new doctors, I was very excited to come across the new concept offered by One Medical.  No waiting and was I shocked when Dr. Ortiz personally greeted me and escort me to the exam room! He then spent the next 30 minutes listening, asking questions, and more importantly Dr Ortiz truly cares.  Dr Ortiz also continued addressing my concerns via email and always responds within a few hours!  Dr Ortiz and the entire staff at One Medical are the best!
5 I had never understood the need or the benefits of having Colon Hydrotherapy done. I was so appreciative of the time that Jolli took to set me at ease. She took her time because she knew I was nervous, never having done it before.   I have not only been back for other treatments, but I get regular maintenance that has helped me greatly with my weight loss and understanding more about the right nutrition to eat (she even had fresh fruits and veggies to eat!) I also have more energy and I don't feel the bloat or have the gas that I used to. I wish more practitioners would care about their clients as much as Jolli does!
5 The best Physical Therapy professionals in Las Vegas! The office staff is very helpful. Everyone listens and they try to help. Unfortunately I am getting better too fast and I won't be able to continue to go there.
1 If you have an appointment with Dr Barnard Greisman, CANCEL IT.   The guy is the most disrespectful, insensitive, and unhelpful doctor I have ever met. He has plenty of sarcastic jokes about your body and does not have anything useful to tell you about your health. I want to accuse him of being unethical and a pervert, but there's really never going to be proof of that because he just plays with your emotions. Overall, he's just a lousy doctor. 0/5 stars.   Don't just take my word for it, look at the doctor's review at Ratemds (google it)
3 This is a great place for a quick massage, but I've never felt that the staff listen all that well, or that the massage is life changing. I end up leaving feeling great, but pain returns the next day. The massages are also quite painful, even when I ask for them to be gentle.   Staff are friendly. Atmosphere is welcoming.  As a side note - I've recently found more luck with the chiropractor, but that is a personal choice.
5 I was Looking for a new chiropractor close by my house and choose the Joint because of its proximity and expansive hours.  I was leery because it's a chain operation, but thought I'd give them a try.  Frankly I was totally blown away.  Pleasant waiting room environment and after filling out a thorough, but not tedious, new patient form, I was called back when it was my turn (about a 10 minute wait) and the Doctor went over my history then described how their adjustment process worked, which is all hands on. I  Was very pleased with the service and the quality of the doctor who adjusted me.  I've been going to chiropractors for years but that was the most thorough adjustment I've ever had.  Even with the initial consult I was out of there in like 25 mins.  Highly recommend this place, if your looking for a new practitioner.
5 I had one of the best massages Ever from Rachel today. Although she did ask what was bothering me at our intake, I trusted her with my body and let her find my trouble zones. Which she did. She did amazing trigger point release and stretches.  Her pressure was absolutely perfect. She made the right amount of time for every part of my body. Dr Chris and Dr Sonya are amazing as well for the adjustments after. I never have to ask them to do anything, they know exactly what I need. What they have done for me and my headaches is beyond what words can describe. I would go to them for Any problem that I'm having!! They have a client for life!!
5 I would HIGHLY recommend SpinalWorks Chiropractic to anyone who is in need of an adjustment. Dr Steve and his professional and knowledgeable staff go the extra mile to ensure that every patient gets the care and attention they need. Dr Steve has helped me overcome neck and back issues and I am now 100% pain free.   Again, I would HIGHLY recommend SpinalWorks to anyone who is looking one of the best Chiropractors in the Valley.  Preston
1 This review is specifically for their pediatric department. My first concern with this establishment is that absolutely everything is discussed out in the open in the lobby. Everything from the child's progress, delays, payments, scheduling, absolutely everything is brought up in front of other patients and their parents. Even disagreements are aired in front of everyone and I partly believe they do this so you won't disagree with them.  My second problem is in regard to what they told us was going to be going on and what really went on. We original went in for speech therapy but my son who is autistic was overwhelmed, so they suggested OT. We were then told by the OT Josh that the goal was to get my son used to working with him and then they would add speech at the same time as OT. A few months go by and I asked OT Josh when would we be adding speech, he told me to talk to scheduling. From scheduling I find out that OT and speech at the same time is not even a possibility.   During this time my son was also approved to start an early intervention government program that would bring therapies into our home and help teach us how to better work with him. We brought this program up with OT Josh and he did nothing but bash the program and tell us how badly our son would do that the program is overrun and that we would never actually see anyone. After hearing this I was really upset but decided to go through working with the program and I have had nothing but a positive experience. They have been the complete opposite of what OT Josh tried to sell us. It was then that I started to realize their concern was not how well my son would do but how much money it would be taking from them.  Even though it was a government program we are responsible for paying for a portion of the visits, because of this we decided to cut back to every other week with OT Josh. He was furious and full out argued with me in the lobby about how inconvenient it was for him. When he realized that I would not budge he stormed off and told me to talk to scheduling. I went over to her and she just tried moving me to another day every week. Finally she went back to talk to him and came back and said pretty much he didn't want to do that. I told her if it won't work take us off the schedule. It was then that she agreed to put us on for every other week.   About a month into this schedule he again went over how inconvenient it was for him and wanted us to move us opposite to another family doing every other week but at 12:30. My son is a toddler and naps at that time. He also tried to sweeten the deal with promises of speech therapy on the same days or every other week between OT. Something they already told us wasn't going to happen. At that point we just had them pull us from the schedule. They were willing to work with another family for every other week but not ours. I wonder how much money they were making off that other family to make such a deal?  Another problem I had was how OT Josh treated me when I was by myself and when my husband was around. He would full out argue and fight with me and tell me I was wrong, but when my husband was around he was very understanding and would try to "work with us".  For the therapy sessions them self he played games with my toddler that we could do at home. He told us that they would start working on a obstacle course to teach my son to slow down and think. I never once saw that happen. OT Josh was also notorious for telling me that my son just didn't want to work today (he was usually referring to the last 15 mins of an hour session). He is two if he wanted to work with you the whole time I would be shocked. He also never gave real feedback on how we could help at home or to better prepare him for coming in. He would come up with pointless suggestions that I could have come up with on my own. Once we moved our schedule to every other week OT Josh stopped trying and it became a waste of our money.   We get way more one on one attention and care with a government program than we did with a private company. There seems to be something wrong with that.  Update: My son was recently approved for long-term care. Meaning that we will be reimbursed for everything medical we have paid out of pocket for him dating back to July 1st. I requested a statement showing what we paid and they sent me an incorrect statement. We were being charge a $40 copay but they were trying to tell me that, that wasn't why we were being charged the $40 that we "obviously" owed them money somewhere else. I ended up arguing with them for at least 45 minutes before they agreed to send the payment statement that matched what I had. To top it off I was also informed that they owe us $40 that I am sure we never would have seen again had I not called them back.  Program we are using https://www.azdes.gov/azeip/ You do not have to have a diagnosis of any kind for your child. It is geared towards kids w/any delay.
5 This is my first Yelp review, and I'm usually quite lazy about things like this, but I believe Dr. Perez deserves to be recognized.  As a physician myself, I am very particular about whom I see for health care.    Prior to moving to Arizona, I was affiliated with University hospitals, and saw only physicians I personally knew to be excellent, often leaders in their fields.  However, after moving to AZ awhile back, I did not have the connections or the knowledge of the local health care professionals to afford me this luxury.  I found Dr. Perez to be the epitome of professionalism both in terms of competence and bedside manner.     His office, internet portal, and staff are all top notch, which I consider secondary to competence and bedside manner, but it sure makes things more pleasant.  I arrived 2 hours early for my appointment due to my own mistake, and I was fit in between patients within 15 minutes.  Despite this, my visit with Dr. Perez was thorough, which is difficult these days given the time restraints primary care physicians often face.   5 stars all the way.
5 Super organized and efficient - you sign in with iPads at Reception, appointments are booked online, and communication is done via email. Wait-times are never long (like they tend to be at the usual clinics/doctor's offices, even with an appointment). My husband and I were both looking for a family doctor, and after a lot of research and searching around, we signed up with Dr. Matthew Cruickshank. He is the best! Thorough and informative without being pushy. We're expecting a little one in March, so we're really happy we found such a great family doctor who we feel very comfortable with bringing our baby to when the time comes.
5 What AMAZING service I received! Everyone was exceptionally professional and just kind, there was never that "rude, here is a clipboard, fill it out, take a seat and yeah at some point we will call you back attitude". That behavior was displayed not just to me but several other families in the lobby. I brought my son in around 6:30 pm after the took a cleat to the shin during a baseball game, he was non weight bearing and was in significant pain. Despite the fact it was peak cold, flu, general crud season he was triaged, received an X-ray and we meet with the most wonderful provider NP Hawk quite quickly! Pleasantly shocking knowing every Urgent Care and ER is packed not just during this season but time of day. I couldn't say enough about how great everyone was from start to finish! Our provider knew just was to say to distract a boy who is a diehard baseball fan and ball player from being in pain, bummed about leaving his teammates and game early and she was nothing short of encouraging and so kind, to lift his spirits up!!
2 My first appt was with a male MD. I arrived, was told he quit, they assigned me to a young DO. Dr. BarreteKo. She ordered a lot of tests, tried to appear as though she was thorough, just didn't want to listen to anything. Subsequent spots (2) were awful! Waited over an hour, was told Dr was running behind, always runs behind and it is because Dr insists on scheduling so many appts per hour and spends too much time per patient so runs late and keeps appts waiting. Second time, I waited over 1 1/2 hour past appt. I complained to office manager, who had nasty attitude. Time to find a real doctor.
5 I have been going to Dr Sameera and Dr Ashley for several years and I've seen the office evolve into a friendly, neighborhood feel. Going to the doctor can be draining but I never feel rushed and Dr Ashley takes her time to answer my questions. Thanks for being awesome doc!
1 Most of the doctors are good. However, if they offer "medical Equipment" from Breg Medical Supply from Carlsbad, CA DO NOT accept or sign on the dotted lines. This facility pushed a "wrist brace" on me. I accepted it. This $25 brace ended up costing $500.00 yes.. $500.00
1 If I could give a "no star review" I most certainly would... This is absolutely the MOST unprofessional clinic, their phone number for the location on Bonanza is for their Henderson location. The two Hispanic girls say there and talked negatively about me in Spanish, as if I didn't know what they were saying!!! So rude!!! DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION!!!
1 Had an appointment for routine blood work. They refused to see me because Dr West did not put in an order. They expected me to come back in two weeks. After wasting my time. I will find a real health care provider.
1 Not a single care to their patient. Staff are not friendly. One doctor, Dr Garcia is very unprofessional and rude.  We called ahead of time if they accept walkins and i was told yes. Upon coming in, we were told the exact opposite thing. I was explaining that I called to have my grandmother checked and was told we can walk in but theres going to be a wait, which is fine. Then this Dr Garcia walked out of her office, approach my grandmother and ask if she's having symptoms at this very moment, which my grandmother answered no. Then this doctor said -then go just schedule an appointment because you dont need to be seen right now, and walked out. . Good thing theres not a lot of patients in the waiting area because this is very humiliating. Very unprofessional. Do yourself a favor and avoid going here, specially Dr Elena Garcia.
1 I go in knowing exactly what is wrong but they can help me on the first visit because it's only a consolation or I have to go to another doctor. Which cost more money. Three times I have gone to them for something and they had to refer me somewhere else because they can't help me.
5 This is the only place in Charlotte that I've been willing to come back over and over. Demetria is great. The whole place is very professional and relaxing. Make an appointment. You won't be disappointed.
5 Great place, caring doc, helped my neck pain significantly using activator technique and gentle adjusting. The staff are wonderful too!  My neck improved so much that I don't need to go that often anymore, and I'm so happy I found Dr. Greg!
5 Dr. Daniel is a State Treasure. I've met him for consults and for my first time epidural. My anxiety level was high coming in the procedure,  but his whole team was very assuring. Dr. Daniel even took the time to see me before I went in the OR to say hi. He is a gentle, efficient and effective specialist, and relates well with his patients. Carrying the name of John Hopkins, I am glad he is practicing in Nevada. Surgery can be avoided. Thank you Dr. Daniel and to your team of professionals.
5 My orthopedic surgeon Dr Feng is awesome! Always friendly and answers all my questions.
4 Doctor Browns NEW OFFICE LOCATION is: 3005A Banksville Rd, Pittsburgh PA 15216 Phone number: 412-942-0702  Dr. Brown takes time to listen and is a great doctor. However, the front desk staff lacks on communication skills as they have never returned my phone calls. I have had to call multiple times to get answers on various occasions.
5 Dr. Sharma is not just a doctor, he is your health advocate. I was able to get an appointment within 24 hours and his desk staff was happy to do so. He listened to my situation then consulted me on the issue. I really believe I have found an amazing doctor in Las Vegas. I highly recommend Dr. Sharma and his facility . The couches instead of plastic chairs in the lobby are a nice touch as well. Go see Dr. Sharma today.
5 Great staff! They are so nice and welcoming. They make it a pleasure to come. The doctors are very thorough and caring.  The rehab process is high quality. I was rear-ended twice in two weeks and they knew exactly how to care for me. I recommend them to anyone especially for vehicular accidents.
5 My whole team and I have been there for orthotics, massage therapy, chiropractic treatment, physiotherapy, and for diagnosis with Dr. Lum.  This place is located right in the centre of the financial district at York and King & accesible from the underground path.   I've had appointments with Dr. Lum to correct a displaced hip that gave me inner knee pain.  Dr. Lum is very friendly, professional, and competent.  He was able to provide an accurate diagnosis for my hip injury.  I've also seen Dr. Lum for a sprained ankle for which I was able to get a ankle brace which helped when playing sports.   Also, I've been there for orthotics and chiropractic treatments with Eric.  Eric is great - friendly, professional, and always on time for our appointments.  He was able to fix my hip displacement which happened in a fall. Additionally, he fitted me for orthotics. He is professional and explained clearly the treatments he was providing. He is knowledgeable and made me feel comfortable.   I was also there to see him for massage therapy. I had severed knots on my back from muscle tension and stress. She was able to get the kinks out of my back and was extremely friendly and professional as well.    Everyone there listens to your concerns and asks the right questions to understand your situation. They assist you in solving your problems.  I have nothing but good things to say about this clinic.  I would definitely go back if I need more treatments as needed.
2 I saw Dr. Marquard's reviews on Yelp, which drew me to this office, as I was in need of a primary care physician. Unfortunately he was very booked and I couldn't wait that long, so I took an appointment with his wife, Dr. Aspen Calkins. The only reason I am giving 2 stars and not 1 star, is that she did seem very knowledgeable and did help me to finally get over an illness that I had for 4 weeks. They have recently moved their office, but I also felt very uneasy about the office itself, but it was very convenient to my home, so I figured I would overlook that. The visit began normally with her asking me questions about my medical history, but the first red flag was that she would not allow me to answer the questions if I could not give her the answer in 1 second or less. She rushed me through each question, and she would go on to the next question and not allow me to find or think of the answer. After that, I had a feeling this wasn't going to work for me, but I decided to give it a chance, and let her finish the race to get done with my medical history. So when that part was done, she gave me some pertinent information and came up with a plan for my treatment. Unfortunately after that, our interaction turned awkward when she found something funny about a difficult reaction I had that affected my breathing. When I told her I didn't appreciate her laughing, she got weird, and said she wasn't laughing, which made things extremely awkward. Instead of being compassionate when she knew I had been sick for a while and knowing it was our first meeting, she stopped interacting with me. So, although I was very thankful for her help and knowledge, she chose to continue to make me feel uncomfortable when she gave me my order for lab work. If I didn't know before, I knew then that I would feel too uncomfortable to return for another appointment with her. I will say the lab technician was very friendly and made me feel welcome. Hopefully in time she will understand what patients are looking for in a physician, and that it's not just knowledge, but that compassion, patience and bedside manner are what is needed to form a good relationship with her patients.
5 I feel so LUCKY to have found Mountain Vista!  Dr. Teames and Linda Tipton have helped me control my chronic migraine headaches and neck pain.   I have had migraine headaches for 20 years and severe neck pain with the migraines for about 4 years. They are the only ones that listened to me and really wanted to get to the source of the problem.   The entire staff at Mountain Vista is wonderful!   I really can't say enough, I actually feel good, for someone in pain everyday, that is everything!
1 This doctor (Furo Oruene) has to be the worst!  Unprofessional beyond comprehension!!  Constantly bragging about his house, the money spent on his girlfriends shoes and the air condition bill.  Extremely unpleasant and ego driven.  Injecting the knee with a minimum amount of medication; then claiming the knee is healed.  Unfortunately, the orthopedic specialist; whom I went too would completely disagree with this quack!!  I definitely would not recommend this quack to my enemy!!   What do doctors do with their mistakes???  They bury them!!!!
1 DO NOT come to this place for your physical therapy!!!! You been warned!! My friend and I had a car accident in Dec 2014 and finished our therapy in March 2015. It's June 2016 and they HAVE NOT turned in our medical records in to our attorney therefore my case cannot be closed!! Their staff might be friendly when you are having treatment, but the moment you are done with treatment they WILL NOT call you back or follow up on their word to turn medical records to attorney. I wish I could give them a negative 5 stars if I could!!!! This did not just happened to me but also to many other people that have been treated here!! I will be seeking legal action since by Nevada law they have 30 days to provide medical records after requested and it has been A YEAR!! Don will keep on making up excuses to not answer your call and not respond to your messages.
5 I started seeing Eric in the middle of last year because of a sudden back spasm injury. As an avid runner I wanted to be treated and be able to get back out there on the road again.  Eric and his team gave me the confidence and the tools to have me running in 6 weeks.  His knowledge and attention to his patients went far beyond what I have received in a long time at other PT facilities.  I am now a healthy runner, I know what it takes to keep my body strong, and I can always visit the team when I need to keep a little tweak or get dialed in before the races.
3 I actually like to come here. It is usually fairly easy to get in and get out, and be seen the same day. Dr. Flyte is really good. Dr. Suni could use some bedside manners training. I did wait an awful long time for bloodwork in their new location, but the techs are always nice and good at what they do. I like the nurse practitioners.
5 What I love most about the Biltmore Studio is the fact that no matter who is leading a class you will have a challenging workout and feel the benefits of yoga. The staff is warm the members are welcoming and unpretentious. If you want to begin or continue your practice you must try The Biltmore Studio.
5 Danny and Joel are so personable and friendly.  They really make you feel valued!  Plus...they are very knowledgeable at what they do. No wonder their staff never leave...they're family!
5 I am a new patient to this practice and I have seen both Dr. Perez and Kathleen Galekovic, the Nurse Practitioner.  My first impression is that I am thankful to have found this office where compassionate and timely care seem to be the norm.  It is easy to book appointments and the staff is exceptionally nice starting with the front desk and continuing on to the medical assistants and the doctor.  Access is easy through online services and I appreciate the ability to email the doctor and every time I have received an answer the same day.  I am already planning to make this my permanent medical home.
5 I started going to rise rehab about a month ago from the moment I walked in the door I felt very welcome.  The staff is very friendly and attentive and they definitely care about your well being.  I've worked with Kim, Stacey, Sarah and Cody and they are all awesome.  I would highly recommend rise rehab!
2 Dr Hilts is very knowledgeable, and I cannot speak negatively about her as a doctor, though I can say with confidence that her staff and business practices made my husband and I find a new doctor.   I went to see her for my yearly physical (which is covered 100% by insurance). During that appointment, I answered questions asked by her & her staff about my health... totally normal for a doctor's appointment, I thought.  Two months later I received a request for payment for the appointment, as Dr Hilts billed the appointment as something different than a physical (which was more costly to insurance, of course). I called to get this cleared up and dealt with rude & defensive staff, who said that my conversation with the doctor made the appointment something more in-depth than a physical, and was billed as such to the insurance company.  When I asked why I wasn't told this would happen, I was told  that patients USED be notified if the appointment has moved into a different 'billing range', but that they stopped doing that to avoid confusion.   Even though I explained over and over again that I only went there for a physical, and would not have entertained a conversation (brought on by their staff) if I would have known that it would prompt a more expensive appointment, they wouldn't budge and I'm stuck with the bill.   Seems like Dr Hilts & her staff are trying to make the most money they can, at the expense of patients. If that's worth it to you, then by all means, enjoy.
5 First, I will say I'm one of those people that has to be practically dying before I will take a Tylenol. Not a good patient. Also, nurses don't like being on the other side of the bed. HA!  Secondly, I had a doctor in LV for a few years and I liked him, but his staff was a nightmare if you needed copies of anything for insurance or work. And, even with an appointment the wait started to be upwards of 2 hours on a regular basis. It got old quick.  Add to this the fact I moved across town not long ago, and I found myself needing a new doctor. I procrastinated hard on this task until I found myself sick & not improving despite my very best efforts to rest and push fluids.  I scoured Yelp for a doctor which is where I found The Trails and Dr. Sharma. I made an appointment for the same day I called to make sure they accepted my insurance, but they do accept walk-ins. I filled out the standard paperwork and began the wait, which was only about 5-10 minutes. So far, so good. The staff was super nice and professional. Everything seemed pretty clean. It definitely felt like a doctor's office more than a clinic or hospital.  I liked Dr. Sharma for a few reasons and as an RN I can be a little critical. I liked that when he came into the exam room, he had already reviewed my chart so I didn't repeat everything I just filled out in the waiting room. He already knew why I was there. I liked that after we greeted each other, he washed his hands before examining me, and AGAIN after the exam!! Finally, I liked that he made me feel like he had all the time in the world to spend with me. I didn't feel like I had to rush to get all my questions answered or that he was rushing to get to the next patient. I can't remember the last time any doctor made me feel like such a priority.  Thankfully, my husband was there to observe all of this because he hates going to the doctor possibly more than I do, and he liked Dr. Sharma as well. So, I am grateful to finally be able to say we found our new doctor!!
1 Took my daughter there for a simple referral. After a 30 min wait they spent 5 min, the building is getto for a Doc office. A sticky floor went uncleaned and not safe. Not a good experience
5 Just got home from my first visit with Scott and I can already feel the difference in my range of motion in my shoulders. My whole body feels more free and I already scheduled my next appointment because I'm SOLD. That was the most intensely effective massage I've ever had and I have been getting massages somewhat regularly for the past 6 years. Scott knows his stuff and he is an extremely professional and ethical person I was more than comfortable that I was in good hands. I'm currently a student in massage school and I'm starting to feel the pain that comes from poor body mechanics and Scott taught me so much that I can do to have longevity in my career and I appreciate that so much. I'm so happy I found him and have hope once again that I will be able to continue on my path to becoming a massage therapist myself because I have not only the right therapist to keep my body in alignment, but a mentor who I already look up to and look forward to learning more from.
5 Amazing Chiropractor! Impossible to find one with greater skill and value in this area. I first saw Dr. Richetto when he was at the joint and I was happy that I was able to track him down! Understands bodies like mine with 30+ years of weight training. Highly recommended!
1 I left this place once and went back?  Now I am gone for good.  I tried calling for three days in a row, the phone rang 15 times each time I called.  I called different times of the day.  I left several message NO ONE returned my call.  I had to drive to the office to find out that they don't refill RX unless you make an appointment.  GEE think someone could have told my pharmacy that after they faxed a Rx over three times?  Or told me when I left three messages?  The Dr and PA are awesome, but the front desk people SUCK!  I came home and looked up a different DR office, called back and of course had to leave a message that I wanted to cancel my appt.
5 I'm not sure what the first reviewer is talking about. Perhaps she meant the electrical stimulation rather than the ultrasound because that sort of situation is simply not possible with ultrasound. Regardless, I don't think it is right to base the overall review on this one thing.  I went here for several months for my shoulder and had nothing but good experiences. They are extremely flexible and understanding with scheduling. They were even willing to work through part of their lunch on some days just to accommodate my school schedule.  Both Matt and Andrea are great physical therapists and the rest of the staff is excellent as well. Everyone is very friendly and personable, which made me want to come to therapy twice a week. It was always a great atmosphere and everyone seemed to enjoy being there.  They were also not afraid to challenge you, which I think was critical to the progress that I made. They would never ask me to do things that I could not do or that would be painful, but they did push me to challenge myself. I improved so much during my time there and did things that I didn't think I would be able to do.  I finished my therapy just a couple weeks ago and my shoulder feels much stronger than it ever has. These are great people and should I ever need physical therapy again, I will definitely be going back here. I would recommend them to anyone!
5 I had a deep tissue massage with Fazia and she got knots out of my shoulders and back that have been there for years! She was extremely knowledgeable and professional and put me at ease. I'll definitely be back.
5 I have been a patient there for about four years.  The doctors are very good, and listen to your individual concerns.  Great diagnostics and follow up.
1 ZERO STARS!!!!  I have been going to Dr Dahlia Wachs for about 2 years now...after just having gone to her the other day with a couple health issues (I was very uncomfortable & in ALOT of pain PLUS paying out of pocket until my new ins picks up)... Today her office called to check up on me, they told me they sent my tests to the lab which I had told them NOT to do due to no ins, as I'm discussing this with the office assistant, Dr. Dahlia grabs the phone, doesn't even let me get a word out, yells at me for lying & changing my mind (I didn't, it was her mistake) then tells me she "has no more time to waste on me & that I shouldn't come back there!" Then HANGS UP ON ME!! Is this how a DOCTOR treats a patient?? A sick patient who isn't well?? Is this how a doctor ends a 2 year business relationship with someone? I guess patients mean NOTHING to her, we can be thrown away at any moment! My husband & I were both long time patients of hers & felt genuinely liked and comfortable with her then in the blink of an eye this is how she turns on us. Unvievable.  Also, front desk staff are incredibly RUDE.  Go to this Dr at your own risk.  EXTREMELY disappointed in you Dr Wachs :(
1 I have removed the comment about Dr George being a good physician.   I received a certified letter stating he was dropping me as a patient. I strongly suspect that it is because of this post. I have never seen him.   DO NOT USE THIS PRACTICE!!!!!  Plus he is attempting to open a concierge practice. Maybe he is giving up on this practice. One can hope.   The problem is he does not know how to run a practice. He does not have an office manager. He is the office manager. He is the only one who can open the door.   Several patients are waiting out in the cold as the office doors are locked. They bill for missed appointments so I will be billing him at my billing rate for the time I am wasting.   He is in the process of starting a new concierge practice. If this is the quality of that practice it will and should fail. Concierge practices are very lucrative. Will he just abandon his current patients since he seems unable to run one practice let alone two?  He really just needs to have an office manager instead of being so cheap and think he can do it all himself. I have not seen it yet, though that could be an indication of how he actually practiced medicine.
1 I go to Urgent Care Extra by my house in Gilbert on Cooper often when i need to, My family and I love it there, I have always had a great male doctor, and been treated successfully and on the spot, Leaving satisfied and overall happy. This time we couldn't have been more distraught, We went in to Mrs. Irene Curry who was new to the facility and saw me. She was rude, unprofessional overall, and even used an unprofessional word once in speaking, as well as kept a condescending tone at all times. She would not give antibiotics as she says to dislike them even with admitting i had a major sinus infection going into my ears (4/6 days in). Knowing steroids do not work for me she gave me solely those, Causing me to miss work, money loss, and get extremely sick. Causing me to get the antibiotics that i needed in first place that she put off 7/8 days after the appointment, Only with giving it after arguing with us giving us a terrible experience. Now being with a sinus infection that spread and loss of financials i speak of experience, This facility is usually 100% but i recommend to ask who is their before going in, Prevent an experience like mine. Do not go to Doctor Irene Curry at this location! She does not represent this facility well!
2 I've been a patient of a GP at Patient Networks for the past year and a half, and while I have nothing  but positive things to say about my doctor, the receptionists and service at Patient Networks is awful. They are rude and have to be reminded multiple times to book your appointments with specialists. My doctor warns me every time she books with me a specialist to call the receptionists over and over again so they actually book the appointment.  "Poor service with an attitude" would be an apt motto.
5 Whenever I have been sick and needed an appointment they have gotten me in same day or the following. Wait times have been very short. I am not sure why people are saying they have had to wait long times. Most I have waited was maybe 10 minutes and that was because I showed up early. The doctors have been kind and courteous. The man who works at the front desk is very nice and helpful. I would recommend this office.
5 So I have been to Elements 5 times, seeing Rodney 4 of those times. I found truly the most amazing therapist on my first visit, thank goodness! They make it easy to book via phone or online. Their online scheduling system allows you to check by day or by who's available. I like that. They have a membership program where you decide which massage you'd like to book (60 min, 90 min or 120 min), they give you a discounted rate for that massage compared to a walk-in and you get it auto deducted from your credit card or bank and you can massage whenever! I had 3 massages saved up when I was out of town and boy was I a happy girl when I came back! So, stop in to a location to check that program out! They offer you a reduced rate on your first massage which is nice. The reception ladies are usually friendly and on top of things. The reception area is clean and the massage rooms are cosy with nice music and privacy.  Anyway, back to Rodney...did I mention he's AMAZING?? He's been massaging long enough to know what he's doing. He has great hands, forearms & elbows and he finds all your ouchie spots! It seriously hurts SO good! If I could I would go religiously on a weekly basis but life gets in the way, you know? If I get a massage once a month I'm happy. I like Rodney's pressure and he is very intuitive, knowing where he needs to back off or just go more slowly. He's very professional, keeping everything covered and he really listens which I appreciate. We can either just be silent or chat depending on the mood. All in all, I will still be seeing Rodney at least monthly so stay outta my way b*'s cuz I found him first!! He's busier on weekends but sometimes you can get in after a run or yoga class. Get there asap! Men or ladies. Go!
5 I super love this place. My kids have been coming here since they were babies (one is now a preschooler and one a toddler). I was so impressed by the quality of care by all levels that when I had finally had enough of my doctor cancelling appointments on me, waiting an hour to see her, etc., I decided I too would join the Village Family Health Team. And I am so glad that I did. I can always book an appointment for the near future, my phone call is always answered, and the doctors and nurses are caring and attentive. I also really appreciate Wellx so that I can email concerns to the doctors and and have them assess whether or not my kids or I need to come in for an appointment. All round great place!
5 Just started going here and had about 4-5 visits. So far so great. It's inviting right when you walk in with a nice fish tank and the ladies up front are friendly and sweet. Dr. Reed does a good job explaining things and never makes me feel rushed, even though there is a waiting room full of people. Before your appointment you can warm up/ stretch out your back on a bed with rollers. The TV monitors display items such as; ways to improve joint movement, brief chiropractic explanations, weather forecast, monthly smoothie recipes, and tips & tricks to reduce stress and increase positive emotions. The little things like this means the most to me and tells me this office truly cares about the well-being of others.
1 BEWARE!!! This review is more of a warning regarding her staff's medical billing. I was seen for a well check which is covered at 100% by insurance. They failed to bill my insurance but instead billed me. Most people know insurance companies can take awhile to process claims so I didn't think too much about it. Once I did get involved they swore my insurance was billed but when researched, my insurance never received anything from them so I supplied a copy of the bill her office sent me but it wasn't enough. When I called her office and asked for the actual medical claim they refused to provide it to me or to my insurance even though I told them they never received it. After I asked for at least the billing codes in yet another call, they finally consented and additionally sent the claim to my insurance. To make matters worse, the claim was reviewed and it was found out that Docasar's office added in erroneous charges. By the time my insurance received and processed my claim Dr. Docasar's office sent me to collections even though I had made several calls and THEY KNEW my insurance was processing the claim. This is unacceptable to put it mildly. I even explained to the manager they overcharged and I was basically told too bad. Horrible experience and even though I like Dr. Docasar I will NEVER, EVER set foot in that office again.
4 Had a very relaxing 90 minute massage today with Zeke. He listened to what areas I was concerned about and did a great job!  Very lovely experience.
5 I have been a patient of Dr. Jones for over 6 years. He reminds you of the old time doctors that were actually worried about you and had time to talk and get to know you. If you want the "doctor mill" experience, look elsewhere. He provides only personalized service with compassion and real concern and not the typical, "get them in and out as quickly as possible so we can make more money" approach. It is easy to forget that he is your doctor and not a friend. I am uninsured and pay cash and he provides full excellent care at affordable prices, nearly half of what I was paying for an office visit at other offices.  Bottom line: Compassionate, personal care, full service, easy to schedule appointments and great prices.
5 The staff of Foothills Sports Medicine are friendly and helpful.  Jackie and the other ladies at the front desk are always very welcoming and helpful. I started physical therapy for an uncommon injury a few months ago and Jess, the physical therapist, has done a wonderful job of getting me back on track to avoid invasive measures. So glad I found this place.
1 The Doctors are nice, however the incompetent front office earns them one star. In the one year we have attended this practice:   1. They are always running late,  2. They have failed  to call to let you know of the Dr is out sick 3. Made us wait in excess of an hour, lying to us saying it would be a few more minutes 4. Kept us waiting while they try to figure out a co-pay
1 Hell to the No!  Go the regular hospital or find somewhere else.  The staff is incompetent and rude. I was misdiagnosed and had to visit a hospital anyway.  Don't waste your time here!  The billed my insurance incorrect and sent me a bill.
1 I phoned at 11am to register and they said I was in luck, because my area would be covered by the doctor on duty, first. They said the shift was from 12 - 6pm and that I would be seen no later than 3pm. After I phoned them at 4pm, to ask if someone was still on the way, they assured me that they were. At 6pm, they said that the doctor's car had broken down and they weren't sure what was happening. At 8pm they said that the doctor decided that I wasn't one of the lucky patients they would be seeing that day, but if we were interested - we could call back tomorrow and try again. After I asked why we weren't notified about this as soon as it happened (apparently, the car broke at around 4:30pm) they didn't have an answer. My symptoms were a really high fever, body aches and a cough. Not sure what else would warrant a doctor's visit and how they decided who they would see that day.  Extremely upset and disappointed, considering we waited ALL day. Very poor customer service. Never again.
5 I found Mission Physical  Therapy by accident, am I glad I did.  I had my labrum tore and operated when told to find a P.T. If I wanted to get my range of motion and strength back in my shoulder.  My first vist with Ben was great. He explained what it took to get where I want to be.  At first I was unable to even lift my arm 6 inches from my side.  Now I feel physically and emotionally higher than I have felt in a long time.  My range of motion is so much better and can feel the strength coming back.  Ben has been excellent, he focuses on building from the ground up and focusing on the entire muscle group needed for shoulder function, not just the big bulky ones.  I have already recommended Ben to friends and family.  I highly recommend Ben to anyone that has any pain.
1 My first (and only) visit was surprisingly awful.  After being treated by a number of chiropractors in HI, NY and NC, I wanted to try this doctor because we attend the same church. Although I scheduled an appointment for an adjustment, I did not receive one and no staff member told me until I was finished. I DID receive an abundance of paperwork to complete (on paper and a computer), a tour of the office (?!), x-rays and an overall examination in my underwear with another staff member present. This visit took 2 1/2 hours without receiving any relief (an adjustment). Based on my previous experience with chiropractors, this was a complete waste of my time and money!  Would never ever return.
5 Easy to make an appointment, very friendly receptionists and doctors. I had an ingrown toenail that had become quite painful. After a thorough assessment, the doctor took care of it painlessly! It felt better immediately. Thank you!
5 You may have to wait, but she is absolutely worth it. Dr. Adams and her staff are so kind and attentive.
5 Have always had great experiences here. The wait is short and the staff is usually friendly. I did have one doctor that was a jerk, but his name was Steven King so how mad can you be at a guy with a name like that?!  I also like that theyll fill your prescriptions on site for a fee. Some might think its a rip off but it's called convenience, you guys.
5 This place is amazing. The staff is the friendliest I have encountered. Especially Martha. She is beyond spectacular. I actually look forward to physical therapy and the main reason is the staff. Amanda and Dominick are great. Super nice and they really take care of you. I definitely recommend PARAGON.
5 I have been seeing Dr. Campbell for well over a year now and I have to say that this Dr. is one of the best that I have ever been to for pain management. The staff at this office are the most friendly and courteous receptionist and staff that I have ever come across before at any doctor' s office. I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for just the right place to have your pain alleviated and I mean not too much and not too little, but just right.
5 Dr Ram is the best Family Dr in Las Vegas and Henderson,   I have been here for 18 years and I know this for a fact. He goes beyond the call of Duty.
5 Gosh where do I start? I can't recommend True Harmony more - truly. I found this clinic by chance, finding their openness to marrying western and offering eastern methodologies of care very appealing. That being said, I generally have only seen Maryanne and Dr. Brass as they are simply the best. Dr. Brass has delivered both of our babies and Maryanne has guided me through our infertility challenges. Both providers have treated me with utter respect and kindness, and have always guided me amply as we made our way through two pregnancies and one miscarriage. I also appreciate Dr. Brass' sense of humor and the connection to her patients that she builds. I am eternally grateful that both of these amazingly talented individuals have been an integral part of our family's story and look forward to many more years of care with them both. Also want to note that all of their staff - Sherry, Brianna, Kimberly, Tessa, Katie and more - have all been uniquely special to me.
5 Excellent doctors office - I cannot go anywhere else- they are that professional and nice The office is gorgeous-  they run a tight ship- they do not take samples from sales people so are not beholding to push a particular drug-  I see Dr Sudekum- so do most of my friends and family- she is a wonderful physician- we are all very pleased.
1 The doctors are good but the office staff is very unprofessional. I have been waiting for 2 months for them to get my prescription approved. I have been calling one to two times per week to no avail. Most times I am told someone will get back to me by the end of the day. However, nobody ever calls. Once I got a hold of someone, The office kept blaming the insurance company so I called them only to find out they hadn't received a request for the medication.long story short if this is how they treat their patients you might not want to trust this place with your health.
5 Great service, atmosphere & results!  I have known about this place for years since my wife went and saw Paul H. (a.k.a. "Doogie") to help her with her back pain.  He is no longer there after becoming Mr. Danica Patrick, but the staff that remains is top notch and I just finished several months of successful therapy for my lower back.  They have made a name for themselves in the golf industry and treat a lot of professional and amateur golfers as well as athletes in all other sports.  They're also not afraid to have a little fun...make sure to ask about the legend of Hans Wienerschnitzel!
5 Very little wait for appointment. My M.A. Ebony and P.A. Walker  was sweet and caring.  Listens and is understanding.
1 The first time my husband went here, he waited 40 minutes past his appointment time to be called back to see the doctor. When they finally did call him back, he was put in the wrong room and the doctor didn't know where he was. They called and asked him to come back in 2 weeks later to review his blood work results and he again waited 40 minutes past his appointment time to be called back. The office manager acknowledged they called someone back that should have been after my husband., but never advised they were running behind or apologized for the tardiness. Even though he was just there for a bloodwork review, the nurse took his weight, temp and blood pressure, surely so they would be able to charge for an office visit vs a consult/review that could have been done via phone. He waited another 20 minutes once the nurse put him in a room, so he had been there a full hour before ever seeing the doctor. I should also mention that the office texted my husband an appointment reminder the day prior AND the morning of his appointment, yet they didn't seem to care that he was here and they clearly weren't ready for him. There was also a sign posted in the room stating that you need to be prepared for your visit by respecting your appointment time and that failure to do so would result in recourse. What is the recourse for running 60 minutes behind and rude unhelpful office a staff?  I mentioned all of the above to the doctor when she finally came into see my husband and she made excuse after excuse. What a joke.
5 After months of physical therapy, chiropractic and acupuncture sessions, I finally found Relevation. Before setting up my appointment, I emailed Jen to give her some background information, and she quickly emailed me back giving me reassurance she could help. After my first appointment, I felt like there was hope again. Both Jen and David truly care about your pain, they listen to every concern and give you their undivided attention. Not to mention, they have so many tricks up their sleeves to help manage any injuries you might have (i.e. dry needling, KT tape, strength training, stretching, Pilates reformer, etc.). Other added pluses are that the facility is warm, welcoming and private. I would highly recommended Relevation!
5 Ein Masseur der Meisterklasse!  Noch nie hat ein Therapeut meinen Rücken, der durch einen Reitunfall erheblich geschädigt ist, derart stabilisiert wie Herr Zintel. Auch auf diesem Weg vielen Dank für die Steigerung meiner Lebensqualität!
5 I've been on a lifetime search to find a massage therapist that understands my body and doesn't make me feel uncomfortable. I finally found David about a year and a half ago. I fell like he understands the body really well and doesn't just do a froo froo massage. He works out the kinks with out making you want to cry either. I dislocated my shoulder about four years ago and he made it feel normal again and has introduced me to some stretches and excercises that I can do at home. So happy to have found him! Thanks David!
1 Two years of visits the this practice have accomplished nothing. The Physician acts as though I am bothering him or like I am full of sh*t whenever I am seen there. "What is ailing you today?". "What is your complaint this time?". When you have chronic pain like fibromyalgia, Doctor's tend to treat you like you are crazy or a hypochondriac. This one definitely does that. He told me that he will not give me a formal fibromyalgia diagnosis because he does not believe in it. Thanks Doc! I'd love to go on feeling like crap and having pain because of your beliefs. The office always smells heavily of B.O. or microwaved food, the lab is incompetent and can't enter orders in to their system without it taking 20 minutes. Going to find a new PCP, finally. This place is a joke.
5 Very impressed with Christa for physio and Kenneth for massage. Both super friendly and knowledgeable.
5 I have known John for 13 years,  he has treated my wrist , shoulder and both knees.  Everything from a broken wrist to knee replacement . I found out though the years that he treats the person not just the injured joint that he is treating . John is a caring person and i would recommend him to anyone who wants quality care ..

1 Just left there, was going to have Doctor Henson become my children and my primary care doctor.     - I have a headache.  Doctor Henson requires a "meet and greet" appointment before giving physicals.  I was not informed of this!    I thought I was going to get a physical.   After being placed in an exam room I was told I would need to come back for the exam, that the "Doctor just wants to make sure you are choosing her to treat you."  - That's why I was there!!!!  Despite the aforementioned, upon meeting Doctor Henson I asked if she could treat my children as well.  She said she could.  I decided I could overlook the "meet and greet," and would bring them to see her.    Before leaving her mandatory social function, I scheduled an appointment for my boys the following week.     On the way home I  received a call from the practice. I was informed that the boys would also have a "meet and greet" with the doctor prior to receiving a physical.      I paid a $30 copay to have a meet and greet with a doctor.  My insurance was billed by the doctor, though I can't see how they can be billed, it wasn't an exam.     She was going to give me referrals to doctors that take my insurance (Ortho/Gyn).  While that is nice, I don't need referrals with my insurance.   What I needed was a physical. This is also what I scheduled the appointment for!   My boys 15 and 21 need physicals.  Its not a social visit, its medical care.    I canceled the appointment.     Also: Staff are allowed to dress down on Fridays.   Medical Assistant was very unfriendly.  Her outfit (faded bedazzled jeans and a black t-shirt) showcased her professional mannerism.  The young African American girl at the desk was very pleasant.  She was the only one who was.     While I was turned off by my experience, I thought Doctor Henson would be satisfactory in meeting my families medical needs.  Her additional request of more "meet and greet" appointments determined otherwise.  A day and $30 wasted.  Did I mention that my head hurts?!
1 My experience with Rosedale wellness goes back a few years.  I was suffering from back pain and wanted a chiropractic adjustment.  I thought my appointment was for an adjustment.  Between the information session with 10 other people, the XRay, more information sessions, being asked twice if I was sure I had not been in a car accident - this guy has zero respect for patients time.  So much sitting and being sold on their other services and wanting to see how much insurance coverage I had to maximize it.  There were times he booked me to come in to just get more sales sessions on other services I should be buying.  Try getting out the door without booking your next appointment.  After going three or four times I  found a different chiropractor who gave me the adjustments I needed and wasn't obsessed with getting more of my money.  It took two or three sessions and I was great, back to normal and pain free ever since.  I wouldn't go back to Rosedale Wellness if they were the only chiro's around.
2 Everyone was pleasant except Dr. Arash Araghi.  From the lady that checked me in to the x ray technologist to the his assistant Molly provided excellent service and we all chatted and built that base rapport. Then Dr. A comes in the office like someone just did a number to him when I'm the one already in excruciating pain. I'm not feeling confident that he will be the best surgeon for me, or anyone for that matter. His bedside manner left me feeling uncomfortable and not wanting to return. I wish it was not so for I just don't want to be in pain anymore.  He had the images from my American Dynamic imaging but wanted me to get them trying to teach me some sort of lesson.
5 The team here is excellent.  I've been seeing Ryan for a right shoulder injury.  He is very professional and knows so much about how to properly treat this injury.  He gives me homework to work on strengthening specific muscles.  I am very glad I checked them out.  I highly recommend.
1 If I could rate this UC less that one star I would!  I will NEVER go here again and will drive out of the way to another one ... First I was misdiagnosed - I was told my ear drum was ruptured based on an upper respiratory infection that clogged my ears - clogged - and they told me my ear drum was ruptured because they saw 2 black areas in my ear??? I was so concerned I went to my regular doc and there was absolutely no rupture, no black spots and no tear ... it was just the cold.  The NP had me wait an additional 25 minutes so a student could take a look too - I get they have to learn but who is teaching you what a ruptured ear drum looks like when it's NOT ruptured!   TODAY I am even more upset that I was charged $170 for the visit because after the front office guy made a copy of my new insurance card - THEY BILLED MY OLD INSURANCE!!!  Now I have to wait up to ONE WEEK to get refunded because of their mistake!  I am livid!  Absolute amateurs!  Stay away from this place.
1 After several years, I am now working with another physician.  I was prescribed the wrong medication by Dr. Sbaih and the answering service told me to wait until the holiday was over and deal with what I had at home as they stated: "The doctor doesn't get paid for this" and would not give her my message.  I ended up in the ER without my proper breathing medication.  Also, the office manager Jamie never submitted my bills to my insurance for over 3 months which I just found out today from their billing department after speaking with Aubrey.  My new physician has helped my stop smoking within one week, has insisted I never should have been on Prednisone for over 3 years and is working to correct this issue immediately.  I am much healthier now and am filing a complaint with the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners.  I have heard nothing from Dr. Sbaih and their office staff has blown me off.  I am still waiting for my records to be transferred to my new physician.  I do NOT recommend this office.  They do not take personal care in their patient's and are all about collecting a co-pay.  You'll sit in their office for 2 hours waiting to be seen.  It's really sad there.  There are much better offices with caring physician's and staff in this town as I quickly found out.
5 I did 5 sessions with Austin Norris over 5 weeks to rehabilitate a minor shoulder injury and learn how to keep working out without aggravating it.   In just 5 sessions Austin helped me:   1) Develop a deeper understanding of my posture and the muscle imbalances in my body.  2) Identify which movements were aggravating my shoulder and taught me what to avoid.  3) Learn a corrective exercise program to relieve my shoulder pain and help restore its function.  4) Learn a full body strength training program that didn't bother my shoulder!   Austin's understanding of posture, injury, and corrective exercise makes him a great trainer to work with if you are dealing with injuries, poor posture, or chronic pain.   Unlike other trainers I've consulted, Austin didn't use pressure sales tactics to sell his training. He was willing to work around my student budget and I learned a tonne about training and my body in the little time we spent training together!
1 MY NAME IS RENEE NOYES This place dragged me along for over two years. I went to Dr. Ughwannagho who said that I had a collapsed disk and the pain would go away. Sat there and argued with me that I always had scoliosis. I have prooff.  Come to find out it is a cyst that has now broken a bone, I have a frature and the nerve pain extends down to my buttucks in the sacral canal region.  They write stuff to cover their own butt and dr. Daftari is the worse.  He refused to help me with pain.  My BP was extreme at times I was so sick at one point that he said he couldnt help with that, he refurerred to dr ughwanngho who is a waanabe doctor.  To young and then he sat there and told me I should start dating again.  Unbelievable.  I cannot walk or stand with out pain still to this day.  I cannot sit because of my tailbone pain.  I cannot look down because something is wrong with my neck.   I DO NOT RECOMMEND GOING TO THEM. I DO NOT TRUST THEM.  I finally have pain doctor that is helping with pain.  ALthough wven this guy judges, when I tell him ist hurts to sit down like the bone feels broken (started may 2015) he wrote that it doesnt appear that it hurts me WHAT why would anyone document that??  I am sick of these doctors they dont write things down correctly and the core institute was always doing that.  NOT RIGHT!  I just want to get better or get the right documention the right diagnoses so I can get on disability.  That is somehting you cannot tell them or they will treat you like crap.  DUMB JERKS I tell them that because I am home bound and hurt.  I cannot work and just cause you say i can it doesnt make it true.
1 I've never taken time to rate a Dr before - but in this case I felt it was absolutely mandatory that I warn others of the experience I had.  I wish I'd read reviews online prior to meeting with Dr Robet Milne!  My daughter who is 16 yo is critically ill and i've been to several medical doctors to find answers.  I was desperate for help.  I found out the visit cost was $395 cash and I'm a single working mother - that is a lot for me - BUT my daughter's health is worth it.   We met with Dr Milne who is very abrasive and intimidating.  He spent the first 30 minutes talking about his daughter and his own personal life experiences and used the "Strength Test" method on my daughter to determine what she was allergic to or what supplements her body needed.   I went along with the recommendations and he also requested a stool test.  At the end of the 1st visit I was charged $595!!!  PLUS $330 for stool test... PLUS $35 for his "BOOK"  PLUS $122 for supplements.   YES  $882!  Not covered by insurance!!!!  YES you can imagine my shock!  I was told the visit was extra long and that is why I was charged so much!  Why was I charged for Dr. Milne telling Stories!!!????  So nearly $1,000 out of pocket on a visit.  So Sad!      NEXT - I was told the office received the stool test results and he wanted to discuss it.  So I had to schedule another appointment.  I was told she needed more supplements and was charged $325 for office visit and was asked to pay $300 for supplements.  When I told them I couldn't afford all the recommended vitamins, I had to "PICK THE ONES" i thought were important.  I then paid $173 for supplements.     These were vitamins and mineral/enzymes.   So another $500 Out of pocket!!  Made me so upset to left the office feeling like I had just hustled!   He's in control of the report, so I had to pay to get it!    After all that - I went back to the office and asked for copies of my reports and I also asked 2 questions.  Should I put my daughter on Protein supplements (she'd lost 30 lbs in 4 months and wasting away) and should I get her on something for her constipation.   I was told that if I wanted to ask a question, I'd have to schedule a consult with Dr Milne and it would cost me $255!!!!!  I was shocked and asked why they would charge me for asking questions??  I'd already paid for 2 doctor visits.  I was told the Office Manager would call me back the next day to discuss my questions.  No ONE ever called me back!!  I am so disgusted by that office and will never go back!  Typing this up makes my hands shake.    His practice is all about the MONEY!  Not healing people.  He only wants clients with Very Deep pockets and people who love his fluffly talk and chit chat about his person experiences.   I know more about his daughter's selection for college than I know how to help my daughter!  It was the worse case of money badly spent and it's at a critical time where I needed that money to help  her get better.  I was totally shafted - AND the supplements she's been on for a month haven't helped at all.    It is a crime that he continues to be in business and dupes the public as he does. I know it is tough finding answers, and Dr. Robert Milne preys on a patient's weakness when in need of care.  I use YELP to search for everything I need and I'm proud to be an active member.  I'm disclosing my identity and my own experience in the hopes to warn others to be on guard.
5 My boyfriend and I went to Dr. Steve after getting in a minor car accident. He made sure we didn't have any serious spinal issues from our accident and then got us on a schedule for adjustments to feel better quickly. It made all the difference! His team was also helpful and friendly every time we went in. The whole experience was positive and I will continue to go to Global Chiropractic when I need a good chiropractor.
1 I had a very disappointing experience at BCML. My foot was severely swollen and I was told by friends to visit a walk-in clinic that had an x-ray lab attached so I could get the problem looked at and figured out all in one visit. I made an appointment - online, conveniently, I will give them that - on a Friday and the doctor took one look at my foot and ordered me upstairs for an X-ray.   The X-ray clinic could not see me that day, so I had to spend the weekend on my severely swollen foot until I could come back on Monday for the X-ray. On Monday, they did the X-ray and I was told it wouldn't be until Wednesday for the results to come in. On Wednesday I was called and told that "the doctor needs to speak with you about the results". So if you're counting with me, this is three separate visits and a week I have been walking on a swollen foot.  I came in the next day, Thursday, to speak to a doctor. Was made to wait a half hour after my appointment time. The doctor simply told me that I had a foot fracture and would need to go to a hospital. WHY DID I NEED TO GO IN FOR THAT. WHY COULDN'T THEY TELL ME THAT OVER THE PHONE?!  I expressed my frustration at the entire process and the doctor simply shrugged his shoulders. He had some diagnostics printed out and made me - on the foot he just told me was fractured - go into the next room to pick up the printouts THREE TIMES.   So, three visits to this stupid place and I ended up in the emergency room all night, where I should have gone in the first place.
5 Staff is very friendly and the Dr treats you like you are part of his family. He talks to as if you are family and makes you feel comfortable. I would really recommend this place to anyone looking for a good DR.
1 I have been with this practice for 38 years. I registered when I attended University. Since then the service has gone down hill. Whilst not wanting to get personal unlike some of the practicioners, who make such comments. I am very disapointed. I had an infection for some three years and in that time they could not diagnose what was causing the problem. Meanwhile I was going through pain and discomfort. If you complain you are under the treat of expulsion, this can be seen by the notices in the waiting room. Also if you try to make an appointment you are told to phone at 8.00pm in the morning, you cannot get connected and when you do there are no appointments and have to phone again next morning to start over again. They are there to serve the people first and the practice is there for the benefit of the patients and not themselves
5 I've been seeing Dr. Garcia for quite a while, and for good reason. She is thorough, efficient and effective. She is an excellent listener and very personable and caring. She makes excellent referrals when specialists are needed. She has always been available for my needs and I feel very fortunate to call her my doctor.  The front office staff are professional and friendly. The nurses are also thorough and really go that extra mile.  As for the negative review- there are two sides to the story and while I'm sorry that happened to you, good health care requires you bring your own advocate and many times it is necessary to ask questions maybe more than once for clarity.
5 I went to pt for my knee pain. I've been working with Mark for the past 6 or 7 weeks.  My knees are so much better.  When I come in we spend the time on him deeply working the area and electric stimulation. He expects me to do my exercises at home and  I don't waste time at  my appointment doing these.  He is very knowledgable and pleasant to work with. I feel like we are a team working   towards healthier knees! By far the best PT  Experience I've ever had. I highly recommend Landmark Physical Therapy!
5 LOVE EVERYONE HERE!  Never been to a physical therapy place but I would have to say places will have some competition comparing to this place! There are 3 PT's whom are....  DON - THE BOSS crazy genius and genuinely caring and super sweet. Takes the time to review through everything about you and even though you don't see him everytime he knows EVERYTHING like every detail about your case and makes sure you are taken care of!!  MARK - super sweet handsome and love bacon ahahha (love this. because we always talk about food while he stretches me.  RUBEN - magical hands that makes your body go back into place where it should be!  The staff here are all AWSOME! Seriously feels like family when stepping into this place.   MY FAVORITE massage  person would be  CRYSTAL she has amazing hands that show me love and pain all at once ahahha of course everyone else is awsome too though... everyone has their own little touch in different ways!
5 Dr. Boothe has the knowledge, technique, practical application, and most importantly the results that set him far above other practitioners I've met.  Having been a personal trainer and strength coach for the last decade, I have come across all levels of therapists. Dr. Boothe is my #1 choice of chiropractor and ART/soft tissue therapist to not only diagnose and treat dysfunction, but to help establish an effective protocol to get clients back on the field, gym, or just back into everyday activities as quickly as possible.  I send all of my clients to "Dr. B" and often joke that he is "too good" as they often only need 3-4 treatments, if that, to be back to 100, and ALWAYS feel better after only 1 treatment.  Not only do my clients rave, but personally, Brandon has helped me recover from numerous joint issues, both from years of abuse from competitive rugby and now the tolls of hard training in the gym.   Whether it be an acute or chronic sport injury, achy low back, or just in need of an adjustment, you'll be in great (giant yet gentle) hands with the best sports chiro in town.   Thanks Brandon for everything you do!
1 Walked in the other day to get a tour as i was walking around i noticed how dirty this place was and the pool area did not look clean either, the employee that helped me out was extreamly rude and unprofessional, towords the end i decided to not even sign up and left as i was leaving the employee yelled something out at me in front of everyone i couldnt believe how unprofessional this establishment was!! I will not be signing up here i will taken my money somewhere else.
1 I have been here 9 times for the same issue....this doctor insists that (within her 3 minutes appointment) that she has to check this, then that, then another etc.... you then are required to call back to find out when your test results are in and it is tough to get any office staff person to answer the phone...BUT then they REQUIRE another appointment to read your results and get a prescription after you already did his in the past appointment.....the whole time billing, billing, billing, billing, billing and billing! I went without my meds for 2 weeks because of her not being able to transmit a prescription to a pharmacy and I had to go back in and demand the prescription...she gave me a story about how she already did it last week but I called the pharmacy in front of her and they confirmed she did not...,AND GUESS WHAT...she billed me for another office visit even though it was her mistake!!!! The average wait time in this office is 2 hours from your scheduled appointment time.....have to agree that I did see quite a few Middle Eastern patients come in after me and be seen before me during my visits. Her staff is really young and look like high school students with no business savvy or idea of how to handle questions or appointment schedules.  I finally said enough was enough and found a new DR and WOW the difference in care! 15 minute max wait time and a professional staff and a knowledgable doctor...all of what Dr Sabiah LACKS! Avoid this doctor and her practice.
1 Very bad customer service. I do not recommend this place and Dr. Wu is very inconsiderate. They made us wait 25 minutes to tell us that the Dr. Wu won't be able to see us because we are 5 mins late. Very inconsiderate!
1 Great doctors. Horrible staff and operations. Been coming here for years as a primary care doctor for my wife and I. This year they've decided to not accept our insurance anymore. I made my appointment months ago and it would have been nice if I were notified that they didn't accept our insurance any longer.   So instead, they tried to get me to pay $75 to continue to just see the doctor. In this day and age, it's not difficult to create an e-mail distribution for everyone with a specific type of insurance and e-mail the group letting them know of the changes. Maybe I should charge them $75 to set it up.   Anyway, now I have to find a new primary care doctor. I encourage everyone to stay away from this place!!
5 Amazing company!  They worked with my son when he was first diagnosed with ASD, coordinating with his daycare to provide therapies.  We recently moved back to the area, reenrolled with them, and ABA has been able to accommodate all 3 of his therapies, Speech Music and OT, with quality therapists.
3 I have mixed feelings about Gesund. I got a number of treatment from Daniel (RMT) and they were solid, but then I booked with Andrei, and the first treatment was really good and as good as the first was ... the second was a real disappointment. I just felt that no work was done, and he said I had angry muscles and he took it easy on me. I decided not to risk it so I never came back for the third one, who knows the third one could have been amazing, ut that is money and my time, so no thank you very much.
2 I'm not sure what to think right now. We've been here 2 hours and just got seen by the NP. I'm sure the staff isn't thrilled to be here an hour past closing and I know there were 4-5 people after us waiting to be seen. Not enough chairs to accommodate everyone waiting.
5 I have been a patient of Dr Barbee for almost 2years . Previous doctors I have had didn't  listen to my concerns and continued to want to push meds on me. I didn't feel as if I was getting adequate care until coming to Dr Barbee. The staff is AMAZING they are always smiling and ensure I'm taking care of. Dr Barbee definitely listens and generally cares for her patients.   I also have read some of the reviews about the wait time for Dr Barbee. Ask yourself would you rather be seen by a Dr who cares and is patient and listens? Or a Dr who will rush to see you and you are out in 15mins? Yes you were seen sooner but your treatment was rushed as well. When I leave Dr Barbee I wasn't just a patient ! But a patient that mattered !! Remember GOOD doctors are worth the wait !!! Thank you Dr Barbee and staff !!!
5 went here with a daily groupon, had a sore neck from a really bad chiropractor i've been seeing. got a massage with Amanda. She was able to get my knots out without it being painful. I fell asleep like 3 times
1 These people in mesa do not care that your on top of your insurance plans and don't plan ahead to check your information or tell you about the problem ahead of time before your appt. Instead make you sit there and 5 mins till tell you that the clients are not responsible for taking care of there plans....grouping you in a class that your not... plus the fact that the office asstiant didn't take the time to take care of her self... dirty oily hair and clothes unclean..will never set foot in there again
5 I don't usually leave reviews, but I thought I would add balance to the other bad review... This place is nice. Lisa was knowledgable and dedicated to her job. I went in for A 90 min shiatsu and acupuncture treatment for neck tension, and it was amazing. I've done chiro, massage, some physio, and osteopathic treatment. I think this in conjunction with osteopathy is the way to go for me. Wayyy better than just acupuncture alone as well. It was Very targeted and deep and it felt great on my tension points. This contrasts to a lot of the RMTs around who find the general area but not the specific spot. She explained aspects of the Chinese traditional medicine to me and didn't push for more treatments. I will definitely be back!  The only con is that it is cash only. Not a big deal, but worth a mention.
5 This place is great, the idea is great and the chiro Dr. Judge is the best. He is efficient very kind and helpful. I wish I lived closer to this place. I would be here more often.
5 Used a groupon for a massage here. I wish i remembered my masseuses name - she was fantastic. I have really bad back issues - she knew where to push and was able to do deep tissue. She was able to get the knots and the tension out but without leaving my back in pain - it's a fine balance. Very knowledgable, professional and relaxing experience.  The room was also great - private, large and well decorated - an oasis to relax in.   I would definately return here for a massage and recommend this place to friends. I just wish I could remember the masseuses name....
1 BEWARE OF THIS SHADY BUSINESS! ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS YOUR MONEY.. NOT YOUR CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND ESPECIALLY NOT YOUR HEALTH! I completely agree with the first reviewer about  them only being concerned with money here.  I was told that all patients had to see the medical director, Dr. Liszewski, and schedule ongoing monitoring appointments with him to continue treatment. That would have been fine if I felt like he provided competent supervision but he was the most useless doctor I have ever been to in 20 years. He is an older man and literally stammered through reading a list of questions for 20 minutes that I could have filled out on a form in 10 minutes. He provided no other physical or personal evaluation and deferred my questions about the cost of the process to the nurse who does the allergy testing?? So essentially he provided absolutely zero benefit to me as a patient and gave me zero confidence that he could supervise anything let alone my health. And that cost me $185.  Then the friendly nurse, Sharon, tells me they can start my allergy testing that day to see what I was reactive to and its $7/shot. Feeling like I should at least get something out of the visit I decide to get testing done that day. Two hours later I walked out with close to a $400 charge and feeling like something was not right with this place.  So I went home and made a few calls and checked the internet then things made a lot more sense. Turns out the nurse Sharon is the owner and she hired Dr. Liszewski due to state regulations for allergy clinics needing doctor supervision. So on paper this place is legal but in reality Dr Liszewski is not providing any kind of supervision from what I saw.  On their website Sharon claims to have "extensive training" under famous immunotherapy doctor in Dallas,  Dr William Rea. Hmm, That is vague. I wondered what that consisted of so I called her and asked what did her training under Dr Rea consist of... she got very defensive and said "that is personal information." Very odd answer when the person expecting you to pay them a lot of money to treat them cant tell you what their training consists of.. especially when the doctor on staff is useless. I called Dr Rea's office and they said she had just taken training courses from him.  After finding this info I emailed Sharon and asked her to address my concerns about her training and the doctor's uselessness and asked her for at least a partial refund of what I had paid. The friendly nurse was no longer friendly when I asked for money back and made it clear that is all about the money for her and she has little concern for unhappy patients. She sent me a reply and did not address my concerns at all but said it was my fault that I did not get results by not following through on treatment with them and denied any refund request stating "AETC is a small business which depends on payment of its patients in order to pay its own operating expenses." Translation.. it's all about the money for us.. we don't care if you are unhappy with our service.
5 Curtis Desana is the best doctor ever!!!! He is always attentive, and his bed side manner is superb. I'd never want to trust anyone else with my care.
1 I chuckled when I saw the one-star yelp rating b/c I also am unsatisfied with this clinic.  My husband has chronic medical conditions and so we relied heavily on this clinic for his care.  We regularly saw Brian Shrawder (PA-C). Brian is a competent medical provider with a good personality. (that sounds positive so what went wrong? well, let me tell you)  One day, my husband and I were at the clinic to get some prescriptions refilled. While walking to the exam room my husband became pale and had difficult time standing. The clinic staff rushed to his aid and got him lying down. Upon discussion, I realized that I had accidentally give him a double dose of Xanax that morning (they were labeled differently and I'm not accustomed to giving him his meds so I didn't realize the situation). I thought my husband was dying so I told the nurse that my husband had drank 2 wine coolers that day. This information sent the staff into an uproar! Brain read my husband the riot attack and accused him of "wanting to get drunk". (my husband is 300+ pounds and doesn't get drunk from 2 wine coolers).  Brian said that if my husband didn't stop drinking than he might not be able to treat my husband anymore.  Since my husband was feeling better, we were released and the staff said they would call in his 5 prescriptions to his pharmacy that day.  The next day, we called the pharmacy to see if the prescriptions were ready. They hadn't receive them from the clinic yet.  I called the clinic to find out why the delay. I was told my woman answering the phone that my husband had been discharged and they wouldn't be writing any prescriptions for him. I didn't know what discharged meant so I asked. They said that Brian refused to treat my husband anymore and they had sent a notification letter in the mail.  (in the mail?!?!)  I was livid! We were waiting for life-saving medications to be sent to the pharmacy and they sent us a letter? Did they not care if my husband got his meds in a timely manner?!  During my discussion with the clinic staff I was told that after we had left, Brian had a talk with the clinic director and it was decided that they would discharge my husband. (the director is an a**hole. We've had problems with him before).  I'm upset because Brian didn't give my husband time to consider Brian's talk about the importance of not drinking. Additionally, Brian didn't notify us that we wouldn't be receiving the meds that my husband really needed.  I do NOT recommend this clinic!  UPDATE: Two days in a row, this clinic promised to call in my husband's prescriptions to our pharmacy. On the third day, they still have NOT done it. I wanted to call them and complain but my husband told me not to bother because obviously they don't care about him and they don't care about carrying through with the promises they make. Again, very disappointed in them.
1 Dr Sbaih and her physician's assistant are both quite good. HOWEVER her office is HORRIBLE! They had over a month to submit my health files to another place so I could get a prescription and they didn't do anything. I called them to ask if they had one of my other files. I was put on hold and shuffled around, until I was just given back to the first person who put me on hold for 20 minutes. I decided to hang up and call back and they had left me on hold while the whole staff went to lunch!  I am also uncertain that they charge insurance correctly. I've gotten several bills that seemed ridiculously expensive, but it's so hard to get anyone in the office to do more than give you an appointment, which is also somewhat impossible. Even when you get an appointment, it seems to be just a suggestion. I've waited as long as 2 hours and 45 minutes to even get called back to a room, and then another 30 minutes until the doctor came in.  I have tried very hard to deal with these issues because I like the doctors, but the office is just too too much to deal with. I wouldn't recommend this place until they get an overhaul of the office.
5 laura is an amazing healer!  she has helped me so much...i work at a computer all day so i have neck and shoulder issues so i get massages often.  but i had never encountered the bowen technique...until laura...and it is soooooo effective!  i saw her yesterday for tennis elbow and once again, laura came to the rescue...don't give it one more thought, BOOK HER NOW!!!
5 Dr. Dave and his wife Vicki live what they preach.  They are genuinely concerned about their patients, and are two of the most knowledgeable and kind people I have ever met.  My daughter (who is 4) and I feel safe, loved, and important each week when we have our appointment.  The Mancusos are in this business out of pure love, not for money like some other chiropractors we have been to.  Amazing people all around.
5 I met with Doctor Mayy Deadrick a few weeks ago and immediately felt at ease. I can tell that she will be a wonderful family doctor. Best of all, Mountain View is home to several doctors so we should always be able to get in the same day or the day after we get sick. The waiting room felt clean and comfortable too, which is a big plus for any doctor's office.
1 This place was just horrible.  The front office staff are rude & unprofessional.  They will sit there and completely ignore you.  The waiting area just looks dirty and unpleasant.  First impression was this place was just scary and desperate.  Needs new paint, new floors, better seating.  Signage is incomplete.  Never fails that you are put on endless hold when calling the office to make an appt.  And when you do actually get scheduled you end up waiting LOOOONG after your set appt time to actually get called back and then don't be surprised if you're left waiting in an "exam room" for another hour.  I put quotes around "exam room" because the room I was put into, while it had the exam bed thing, it also had multiple boxes and various junk stacked up so basically it was a storage room.  Absolutely unprofessional.  The sort of place I'd expect to see in a refugee camp.
5 I have seen both Dr. David and Patty. Unfortunately I have injured myself or gotten into accidents over the past few years so have needed chiropractic and physical therapy numerous times. Both Dr David and Patty are fantastic!!! They are so knowledgeable in their respected fields and are continually expanding their education by attending seminars and classes. The staff from Beverly at the desk to the physical therapy assistants are great. I recommend this office to all of my friends that need a chiropractor or physical therapist. They also offer cryotherapy which is a huge plus for those swollen and aching muscles/joints.
1 Terrible customer service and poor rapport with clients.  Feels like you are in a fast food joint for chiropractic service.  Would recommend finding someone else in the area.
5 Edit:  my Dr is now Marc Lewin.  Possibly even better than my old doc.    My doctor is Jessica Kaiser - she's one hell of a lady.  They have a new online system that you can make appointments and ask for refills with, which is very convenient.  I think she's the greatest MD I've ever had :)
5 what a fantastic life I am NOW living without my feet killing me after a visit to Arizona Orthotics and Dr David !  what a life saver and without his help and knowledge , my feet would still be painful .  The quality of Orthotics that we both selected are amazing and was super happy that both the Dr and I choose the ones I needed most and not just a sales of any kind would do concept.  I encourage anyone with any kind of foot leg or back pain , to stop in and see Dr David and listen to him and get started right away !   Living a Happy life pain free.... Mr. JRLopez
5 Carlo is incredible!  I've been having low back issues for about two months due to bulging discs.  Carlo is able to find and release trigger point and has been an integral part in getting me back to work.  Run to him and be saved!!
5 This place helped save my life. I spent 22 days in ICU after a car accident. Then 8 days on the hospital floor. After 30 days in bed on a liquid diet I could barely walk. I wanted to go home but I knew I couldn't. Health South was a great experience. They helped me get myself back together. I still wear the green band I earned after racing my walker in the hallway to earn permission to use the bathroom by myself. I've never met so many people who loved their jobs and genuinely cared about me, the client/patient.
5 Andrea is fantastic! I go to her now for any of my aches, strains and back issues. I first went to her after gettin hit by a truck, yes a full size truck! She got me back to better than new and taught me the tools to help stay healthy!
1 I went in as a new patient for a simple prescription refill and by the time I left an hour later the doctor had run a blood test and ordered an x-ray.  There was no discussion about the cost of these unnecessary procedures and I was shocked to receive a bill a few weeks later for $1,000.  I called Mayo's corp offices to discuss the issue and they said I had no option but to pay the full amount and they would not work with me on getting my cost to something that was even halfway reasonable.  BE AWARE OF THEIR PRACTICES HERE!
1 So I used to go to this family medicine group. I worked across the way and it was convenient. But whenever I asked for lab results, medicine refills and the like I was shuffled around by a myriad of medical assistants. When I complained, and asked to speak to Dr. Hatfield to get the situation straightened out, he instead wrote a letter to my EMPLOYERS telling them that if I did not remove my negative review of his practice, he would stop referring patients to my practice. Seriously? What does my personal medical care or lack of have anything to do with my job? I wasn't happy with his practice nor the treatment and lack of follow up I received there. That's it. To contact my employer and demand I retract a truthful review was inappropriate. It caused issues for me at work, which once again had zero to do with my own personal medical care. Nothing. Unprofessional to say the least. So I guess if you don't like this practice, you best fear for your job. Who even does that?
1 My husband started going here in February and got stuck with some kind of resident or student. 3 months later and they are still sending him for test after test and refusing to do anything until they decide what's wrong.  I understand they want to correctly diagnose him but he's in serious pain with his sciatic nerve and they refuse to even send him to an acupuncturist, rmt or physio to help him manage the pain. When he asked if he could please have some sort of treatment, he was told that there was no one on their team who did these things, which means either their website and the reviewers here are lying or she was.  When we called the office to complain, the Centre managers just wanted to fight about what happened. So much for customer service.
4 I have only been here once so far, but I was extremely impressed during my visit.  I was referred here by my doctor and wasn't particularly excited about having to go, but when I walked in the door I was immediately comforted. It is a bright and clean and new atmosphere, you don't feel like you are at a doctor's office or a rehabilitation center at all.  The staff was all really nice, they have interns who are actually helpful and good at what they do. I felt that the PTs listened really well to my bad explanation of the problems I am having, and stayed more positive about a successful treatment of my spinal problems than any doctor or chiropractor I have visited.  The PTs were extremely helpful, they took the knowledge that I was a college student and tried to find as many resources on campus for me as possible. They also gave me the option of borrowing equipment for a week to test out before I decided if I wanted to purchase it, which I really appreciated. I also appreciated the print out with drawings and instructions of the at-home stretches I need to do.  I'm actually pumped about going back.
5 Highly recommend this place if your looking for a dedicated, experienced, professional who really listens and goes above and beyond to get the job done! Everyone is extremely helpful positive and kind.    I started coming to Myodetox after my boyfriend always telling me about how his whole volleyball team loves Boris and his magical fixing hands. I was not disappointed!   At first I was going to Boris to help with tightness in my hamstrings, hips and shoulders. Results were often immediate and helped me achieve better form and dig deeper in my workouts.    After my car accident and suffering from some serious whiplash and  a terrible concussion Boris really dedicated his time to help me.   He informed me on what to expect with concussions and whiplash and how to overcome my daily obstacles while being rehabilitated   They do a lot of services here! It's like the one stop shop for anyone's needs! I have had Physio, massage, acupuncture, cupping, and even things on vestibular rehabilitation. The list really just keeps going.   I still have a long way to go but I have made some incredible progress which I owe all to Myodetox!   Through my experiences thus far I can honestly say Myodetox really will bring back the new you
5 Dr Sullivan is the best Dr I have ever had. He is incredibly thorough and extremely intelligent. My daughter has had problems for years, been through dozens of test, Drs etc to no avail. Dr Sullivan diagnosed her the 1st time He saw her and she is finally healthy. Dr Sullivan is very patient and takes all the time you need. He is simply said " Simply the Best. Go see Him you shall not be disappointed. He has figured out issues I have had that other Drs couldn't.
1 Last year, Dr. Art Mollen diagnosed me with Type 2 Diabetes. This is, virtually verbatim, the 15-second conversation: "Okay, you're diabetic. The nurse will show you how to use the tester. Good to see you again." And he walked out. I've never in my life had a doctor just write me off that way. I resolved to find another PCP. In fact, I flew to Ohio (from Arizona) to see my husband's PCP, who said, "Okay. You're diabetic. Let's talk about a treatment plan." He sat down with me for 15 minutes and explained what diabetes was, what I needed to do, and answered all of my questions.  Fast forward to today. I went to Urgent Care last week and was diagnosed with pneumonia and acute bronchitis. A friend had recommended Dr. Melvin Bottner, so I called to make a follow-up appointment. I was surprised to reach The Mollen Clinic, because I didn't realize Dr. Bottner was part of that practice. I asked to make an appointment with him, and was told I could not change providers. As in, if I was Dr. Art Mollen's patient, I could only see Dr. Art Mollen - or, I had to pay for an office visit to explain to him why I wanted to change doctors within his practice. Ludicrous.  If you enjoy uncaring doctors and ridiculous office practices, by all means chose The Mollen Clinic.
5 I came to thIs building two years ago and I have to say it was the best decision I had made. They truly help you grow as a person and leader because they know healthy people create healthy work environments. The love you feel between staff members is truly unbelievable and is rarely found in the work place. No matter where life takes me I have Sunview to thank for the person I am today and they will always hold a special place in my heart.
5 I went to Sarah with an acute pain through my shoulder and chronic wrist pain.  After a very thorough examination she told me that the pain was due to problems at the C5-C6 level of my spine - I was convinced that this was not the case and actually argued with her.  She massaged and gently manipulated my neck at the C5-C6 level.  With each subsequent session she made more progress and now I am starting to ride my bike again because I am pain free.  All the other professionals I spoke to wanted to give my drugs - Sarah gave me her time and expertise, and that's priceless
2 My mom was in Hospice here.  That daily staff have no clue what hospice entails.  They need some end of life training.  Thank God for Compassion Care Hospice staff that came in daily, I only wish I had hired someone to be there around the clock :(
4 Honsberger helped me restore full range of motion after shoulder sublaxation (fairly light injury - like a partial dislocation, but I wasnt able to push a shopping cart without getting sharp shoulder pains) within about half a dozen sessions. They also provided after-care advice for my main shoulder issue as well as anything else they spot (e.g., my posture could be improved) or anything else I was curious about e.g., sports medicine tips for running or any sports you play.  Overall they are a bit pricier than other physio clinics in Markham but this was right near my work and luckily turned out to be a great clinic that shows genuine interest in helping their clients get back out there.
1 Very negative. requested shiatsu and hot terrible general relaxing message not sure why they told me they could do shiatsu. upon complaining the owner told me to book another (more expensive ) appointment with her !!
1 Longest wait & worst service.  Even with an appointment I waited an hour in the waiting room and then another 40 minutes in the patient room.    Additionally, I left a phone message for the doctor (Verdejo) and was never called back.     Choose a different PCP if you can.  It's not worth it.
2 Wait time is ridiculous. Staff isn't the friendliest and the visit with the Doc is very rushed.
5 Received a wonderful prenatal massage here.  Was easy to book and great price.  I'll return the next time I'm in Charlotte.
1 I don't even know where to start. At first Dr. Murutka seamed great. I explained I was concerned about nut allergies and he said he would do blood work on different types of nuts. The only nut he tested me on was peanuts which showed up. I wanted to know all of them. So next visit he says I need to see a allergy dr because the blood work isn't reliable (then why do it in the first place?). So it takes a little over 2 weeks to find out that was denied by their allergy specialist because I'm "not taking any allergy medicines so there is no need". People can be allergic to other things aside from seasonal allergies and I would think any allergy dr would know that. The office takes forever to get back to you! I would call 5 times every day and constantly get a voicemail and if I missed the phone call I wouldn't hear from the office manager Maria for another 2 days - completely ridiculous. Dr Murutka also didn't understand why a personal trainer would want someone to drink a gallon of water a day and said, "That sounds dumb to me, only drink when you're thirsty". Everything you read about working out, eating healthy, etc tells you to drink A LOT of water and he pretty much scoffed at it.  He wanted me to have an ultrasound done and said, "I don't need to see you." I had the ultrasound done, called to ask the results and was told "You have to schedule. You should have scheduled with us." Well, the Dr said I didn't need to and so did the office staff. Clearly the entire office does not have their things together. Maria was rude and tried to tell me what her allergist dr said to her son as if it applied to me too. I'm pretty knowledgable about the fact that nut allergies can vary case by case and all the way down to the specifics of the protein, so please don't tell me what your dr said to your son because that is an entirely different case. Keep your personal business out of the work when dealing with customers and listen. As soon as I got off the phone today I called my insurance and switched primary drs out of their system. Don't go there - especially Dr. Murutka.
5 "My daughter needed a sports physical ASAP and I found this office on line and was a bit skeptical at first. We walked in at 7:30pm on Monday Jan 6th and was certainly impressed!!The office was very clean and well decorated Brittney (front office) was very nice and welcoming. Dr. Johnston was fabulous!!!and very thorough. Oh and the assistant was great as well! We will definitely spread the word about this clinic on Cheyenne and Durango and most defiantly be back! Thank You Dr Johnston and staff! " - See more at: http://feedbackworks.com/referrals/2826/s#sthash.yXJphfBT.dpuf
1 The walk-in doctors I have met (Dr. Grewal and Hussain) were attentive, knowledgable and very caring. But I was appalled by the receptionists and some trainees that seemed to have placements there. When I went to get a regular blood test done for a school requirement, a nurse trainee failed to insert the IV properly into a vessel and kept giggling during this unsettling situation, while the needle was still in my arm. She continued to giggle and said I should relax while moving the needle around trying to locate the vein in my arm. I told her i'd be glad to get this done elsewhere if she felt uncomfortable but she refused, kept trying, and blamed my apparently small veins. Her mentor (?) took over after seeing her struggling, which made the situation proceed smoother.  After I called the receptionists to request for my vaccination record, they scanned what looked like a part of my clinical summary (not an official record) in a slanted angle and didn't include any letterhead or any official identity of the clinic. Instead, a cut-off URL was included at the top right corner of the pdf. They seriously could not care any less. Why waste your talented doctors with such poor staff?   Go to another clinic to save yourself the headache and traumatizing needle poking.
3 I have very much appreciated Dr Fisher over the years, and would have given him a 4 star rating, but the office staff has gone seriously downhill, and I would give the staff a 2 star rating.   After leaving two messages during business hours on separate days last week, I received no call back.  Due to the lack of response, I had to go to CVS Minute Clinic, which was fine, but then I get this letter saying Dr Fisher will no longer be my doctor, and they are sorry that I have chosen to go to CVS.  Chosen?  Are they kidding?  I hope the letter indicates that Dr Fisher is retiring, rather than dropping me as a patient.  Time to find another Primary Care Physician.
5 Came in around 4:30 pm on a Monday.  Was greeted by the receptionist right away. Very nice friendly young lady. The waiting are was clean and well lit.  We were brought back to see Dr. Chang after a short 5 or so minute wait and she was very nice and answered all of our questions without making us feel like we should have brought a medical dictionary.  This place is both a primary care (pediatric, well woman, ect) and urgent care open every day.  It's very convenient and we like the staff so we will definetly be back.
1 Allegheny medical is the LAST place anybody wants to go for any type a visit. Period  I went in for a required work physical back in August. My insurance requires it yearly AT NO COST in order to stay on our premium plan. I get a bill in the mail (because clearly they coded the visit wrong). I contacted Allegheny Medical to have them take care of this for me and they put the blame solely on (Im not naming the blood work company, to protect their reputation) and told me I had to deal with them. I called (unnamed) and they advised me this was solely on Allegheny Medical to fix. Allegheny Medical then refused to help me completely.   Allegheny Medical will do whatever it is they can to screw you out of your money. They are pathetic and have some of the worst attitudes in the office that I've ever seen. Arrogant and condescending. And highly unprofessional.   If I was dying and they were the last "medical" practice available to keep me alive, get my coffin ready and hole dug. But go ahead, keep practicing taking people's money and screwing them and not helping them when it's YOUR mistake in the first place.
5 Exceptional doctor who provides exceptional care. I've been going to Dr. Dykema for over 10 years for everything from hormone therapy, PAP exams, general examinations and a variety of other medical treatments. She tries to find the root of the problem in comparison to simply prescribing drugs like most other family care physicians. She is actually healthy herself which I think is very telling. She's very caring and has always made me feel incredibly safe during the visits. I'd recommend her to anyone.
1 I have to say that Dr. Nnadi's practice is by the far the worst office I have ever been to. As the previous review says, she over books patients and I have always waited at least an hour, sometimes more before seeing her. Her office is uncomfortably hot and she has no compassion for her patients. She definitely has poor bedside manner and is very rough to you physically, as well as with her demeanor. I feel like Dr. Nnadi is more concerned about money then her patients. She wants you to come in for everything, so she can just make a buck. I have had other doctors that would send me results through the mail or go over my results on the phone to avoid wasting my time with another visit, but Dr. Nnadi wants you to go in to her office to have any results read in order to collect your co-pay.  Do yourself a favor and choose another doctor, you will be grateful to avoid this train wreck!
4 I actually like the front staff and appointment desk. The systems were down but called back promptly with a same day visit w an afternoon call. They answer emails and return messages to same extra visits. Seen 3 different Dr's, really no issues. Except I'm writing this bc I'm so sick I can't sleep late at night. But I left a message to say I'm getting worse, I have faith I'll hear back later.
5 When I broke my wrist in 4 places, I went to Landmark PT for therapy and they were wonderful! Understanding, encouraging and positive. I worked with actual licensed therapists, not techs or aides, who watched me closely each time I was there and made sure I was progressing. They were very thorough and knowledgeable.
5 This review is for the sweetest nurse I've ever met, Cookie:) she's has gone above and beyond to help me everything that I've come in, which is a lot since my insurance company requires a lot of authorizations. If you're looking for a kind and caring nurse, who always has a smile on her face, she's the one to see! Thanks Cookie!
5 Open on Saturdays that's a big plus!!! Receptionist is friendly and Dr. Is great. Wait time is less than 5 mins, clean office, was in and out in less than 30 mins!
3 My first visit I was a bit nervous, Jolli makes your feel comfortable. She's extremely knowledgeable and will answer all your questions. Jolli is the bomb.com during the poop show lol.
5 Best massage establishment in Scottsdale. Not one bad therapist in the bunch. Whether I need significant pain relief or just stress relief, this is the place. Deep pressure, reflexology ... they do it all. I've always received my full time. Never had one bad or even mediocre massage. In fact, I've walked in there crippled over in pain and walked out upright. They care about their clientele and have a great arsenal of techniques for those of us in chronic pain from past injuries and conditions. I can't understand how anyone could ever have had anything less than an outstanding treatment.
5 I don't normally write reviews, but I'd like everyone to know that Physiotherapy Associates is the BEST PT clinic I've been to - ever! Their treatment far surpasses the other clinics.   At Physiotherapy, you will receive consistent, quality and expert care.
1 Can I rate a half star? This location doesn't deserve a full star.   Waiting time is ridiculous. They don't have enough doctors for the amount of patients they book. I can't remember a single time I went to an appointment here and left within 2 hours.  Also, It genuinely feels like the doctors don't care about their patients. You don't see the same doctor every time, you see different doctors that get to misdiagnose you over and over.   After I stopped going here I went to a quality office and was blown away by the poor quality of treatment I got at CIMA.   Please don't go here. Spend your time and money elsewhere.
1 Well..I unfortunately need to update my review. Dr. Smith is no longer practicing and the office was bought out.   I took a chance and went to see one of the new doctors. My appointment time was at 11:00 am and I waited in the waiting room for over 1 1/2 hours. asked the front desk manager what was going on with my appointment time and she said that they have a new system and working out the bugs.   I was finally taken back to the office. Doctor saw me for all of 10 minutes, I have a lump in my breast that is painful and turning my skin red. After she looked at it she said she "thinks it may be a infection" gave me a shot of antibiotics and told me to go to the ER if it gets worse! The last thing a woman wants to feel, is brushed off when we are dealing with a lump in this area.   I spoke with the nurse and told her my feelings and she said she would speak with the doctor, but nothing came of it. No test where done to find out if in fact it is an infection.   I will be finding a new doctor and getting a second opinion. Worst experience ever. The practice is no longer a caring practice but a corporate company that obviously only cares how many people they can see on a day to make more money if insurance. I will also be filing a grievance with my insurance company. No reason they should have to pay for such poor care.
1 Disappointing. Scheduled a massage for my elderly father. He could not find the location. He did not have the number to inform them. I called to reschedule and they would not honor the Groupon pomotional value nor the amount paid for the Groupon. They essentially collected my $29.00 donation and told me that my father should have called to cancel the appointment.
5 I came here because my family doctor was away on vacation (yet again) but I'm so glad I did! I mean I might even switch!  There's a pharmacy attached and it leads right to a very new and shiny waiting room! When I came in there was no wait at all! I'm talking like 5 minutes tops! Doesn't get any quicker then that!  Dr. Leung was very informative, friendly and professional! He even helped me get the best option and was honest on how ridiculous pricing is for meds. He seemed like he really knew his stuff.  The pharmacist, Brent was super friendly as well! Making conversation and all that good stuff.  Five stars for sure for this place! They are even having a female physician come on board in March so keep that in mind as well! Definitely recommend this place!
1 I returned to Hatfield Family Medicine, 36 weeks pregnant, after a few years of not seeing a primary care physician. I rarely go to the doctor but have had regular visits with my OB during my pregnancy and he requested that I receive a vaccine from my PCP... I complied and made the appointment with the last office I had been to, Hatfield.   When I called to schedule the appointment the girl that I spoke to on the phone was VERY rude, short and seemed to be talking to someone else in the background about something unrelated to my phone call. I gave her all of my insurance information (ID numbers and such) and set a date. I then asked her if my vaccine would be covered by my insurance policy and she bluntly told me that it was my job to find that out, not hers. Fine.   On the day of my appointment I arrived 10 minutes early, and signed in. There were 3 women at the desk when I arrived and not one of them greeted or even acknowledged me upon arrival. I gave them my insurance card and photo id when they finally got to me (I was the ONLY one in the waiting room at the time) and was then told, with a snotty attitude, that I needed to call my insurance and have their doctor added to my list as I had been assigned to another doctor. Again, Fine.  I don't mind making a phone call, that I can only assume could have been done LONG before my appointment time, if someone would have had the decency to ask me to do so. They could have easily asked me to make the call prior to my appointment instead of snapping at me in the waiting room 5 minutes prior to my appointment because it wasn't done. (I should also mention that I am new to this insurance plan and had NO IDEA that I was even assigned to a doctor, let alone a doctor that wasn't theirs!!)   My appointment was in the very early morning, so I partially understand the lack of enthusiasm in the office, but after dealing with the front office staff I am fully convinced that their bad attitude is probably an all day type of thing. I was hoping that I could voice my concern to the doctor, but he too was rushed and seemed inconvenienced by my appointment. After seeing the doctor and receiving the ONE vaccine that I had to go through all this trouble for, I was then left to exit the office on my own and was, again, not acknowledged on my way out, even after stopping at the counter to make sure no co-pay was due.   I work in the medical field and can tell you first hand that staff like this in any other office would be terminated... It's a shame that an office built upon "family values" hires such unpleasant personnel to be the face of their business.
1 This place is terrible. I came in at 7am for a drug screen/physical right when they opened and told me about a 2 hour wait but I could make an appointment for later in the day and it would be faster. So I come back for my appointment at 12:15 and guess what, a 2-2.5 hour wait. So I drove across town twice. My advice try a different location or just wait because they're going to make you wait either way.
1 This the worst hospital I have ever been in.  The food is nothing but frozen meals that are reheated and most times, the meals are 1\2 hour to an hour late. It was so bad, that my family was bringing in all my meals.  You have to constantly check with the staff about outside appointments. Often they forget to schedule them or schedule them at the wrong time. Twice I was late being transported back to a hospital for treatment. Once I was so late I had to reschedule. Ten percent ofthe nursing staff actually care. I have a food allergy to eggs and kept being serve redeggs. I finally just asked for toast which was usually burned and cold. Most meals were served with canned fruit which never ferried.  I often waited for almost a half hour before anyone answered the call button and then told my can was busy and would be in soon. This usually happened on weekend nights. If you speak with management, they always tell you they will look into it, but never gets back to you.  If you or your family need rehap care, do not go to Kindred. This used to be a good facility, but not any more. They need to change the management. Until then, avoid this place at all costs.
5 I signed up for the wellness plan and it's been one of the best decisions I ever made. I was new to massage therapy but boy oh boy was it a worthwhile investment! The deep tissue has felt so nice and given that I have a chronic illness, it's been a very helpful & holistic way to destress and detox my body! I love the staff here, they are so so friendly and welcoming. I'm going to miss this place now that I'm relocating out of state!
5 Dr. Lopez and his staff are very nice and helpful. Throughout my pregnancy they answered all of my questions in a timely manner and made me feel very comfortable.
5 I see Dr. Sonu Bhatia. He is amazing. My husband and I have been coming here for about a year now. He takes time to read lab results with you, he EXPLAINS what they mean, he is very friendly and knowledgeable, his staff is great. I have no problems with the staff or the doctor.  They have SATURDAY appointments which is great. I would highly recommend Dr. Bhatia and his staff.
1 If I can give this place negative stars I would. I selected this location as my primary care provider because it was close to home. I have visited this Dr office 3 times and 2 of my 3 visits resulted in extremely long waits and no consideration for other patients time what so ever. Let me just say that my visit today was just to get some blood results in which I already knew what the results were so I only anticipated my visit to take 5 mins. I also want to say the Dr I was assigned to was Dr. DeBellis. On my first visit I felt that the lady who checked me in treated me as if I was impeding on her time. But after completing the necessary paperwork and a couple returns to her desk she warmed up to me. The 2nd visit I waited 45 minutes to be seen by the Dr and by this time the front counter clerk noticed I had been waiting extremely long. My 3rd and last visit (today 08/27) my appt was scheduled for 11:15. I arrived 10 minutes early for my appt and upon checking in the front counter lady advised me that the Dr was running 20 min behind and said that I shouldnt be waiting as long as last time. I figured ok I can handle that. Well I had kept myself occupied on my phone for an hour and noticing there was me and 2 other people in the lobby before realizing I had waited that long. So I asked another office asst what the delay was and that I had been waiting for nearly an hour. All she could tell me was I was next. 15 mins later (now waiting an hour 15 mins) I approached the counter again demanding an explanation why the Dr was taking so long. All she could tell me was that the Dr had 3 other patients waiting and that I was next. At this point I was losing my patience and asked if there was a nurse, nurse practitioner, or office manager I could speak to or if another Dr could give me my results. Needless to say no one was available. It was then suggested to me that I reschedule my appt and then I was told my appt was scheduled at a bad time. (Wtf?!? And mind you I waited 5 weeks for my appt). I finally am told that the dr would see me in his office. So waiting yet again by this point it is now going on an hour and a half the dr finally comes in all upset with me and said that he has emergencies! I told him if these people have emergencies than they should have gone to an emergency room and that I had been waiting for an hour and a half for an appt I had sheduled at 11:15 in which  I arrived early for. Then he asked me if I had lab results and I told him thats what I was there for. Then he yelled back at me that he didnt deserve this abuse! He read my results off a printed report and I told him I wanted to talk to the office manager so that they can better manage his time. I asked the dr why another dr couldnt have just read my results. So long story short I apologized if I seemed to be abusive toward him but it was unacceptable that I have to wait an hour and a half for a five minute visit.  His answer was something along the lines that he didnt make the rules. (wth? Someone couldnt read a piece of paper to me?) lastly I waited another 5 mins and talked to the lady who checked me in and the last thing she told me was that Dr. DeBellis always runs late and that I could change drs who runs pretty on time. Sorry this a long rating but seriously? As soon as I walked out I called my insurance and changed my primary car provider to a different office altogether.   First of all I dont care what kind of insurance I have drs get their payment either way and I could have saved my silly $5 copay for them to either call me with the results or pay the f'n 49cents postage to mail me my results! Second of all Dr. DeBellis ALWAYS runs late?!? I dont care how much of an amazing dr you are, learn some time management!!! Doctors should appreciate that there are people like me who have taken the time and effort to educate myself and lead an active healthy lifestyle to keep myself healthy so they can attend to the more serious conditions that others suffer! Plus the insurance companies should be paying me since I am the minority who keeps the premiums low and allow them to cover those with more catastrophic illnesses!!
1 My therapist was great but this business practices of this company sucks. They don't tell you if your visits aren't 100% covered and to bypass that you are told you've signed an agreement to pay what insurance doesn't.  For me, that ended up being $248/week!!  I've never had a business charge me what insurance didn't pay.  Usually, at least decent companies just accept the insurance payment.   If they had said at the beginning because THEY KNEW at my first appt what insurance was capping amount of visit, I wouldn't have gone. Instead they hide behind you signing their agreement full well knowing you have to pay.  Make sure you know before beginning if your insurance covers you or you'll get a $700 Bill for one month like Me! Not happy at all
1 Please do not go to this doctors office. They have a very one-sided contract that they make you sign. If you question the documents and try to protect yourself they refuse to speak with you and refuse to see you.
5 Dr. Oriel is a great doctor.  She is honest always listens to what you have to say, instead of just blowing you off.  She takes the time to make sure your needs are met.  I am glad to have her as my doctor.
5 This is truly a great facility with your lab needs all done and results within minutes. The fact they take patients without appointments is a major plus as well
5 This place is great, they helped my husband get back to work in no time. They explained every step of the process to us and eased our worries. Everyone is so friendly from the front office to the therapist. We have been to other therapy offices and nothing compares to how much they care about their patients. Truly a great place for your therapy needs.
5 If you've ever wondered what an enjoyable Drs. visit might be like,  check out CHS! As soon as I got started on regular treatments I started calling this place the "Disney Land" of chiropractic care! Not only are all of the workers here kind and helpful, most have a great sense of humor so my goofy sidebars usually make someone laugh.  Above all my treatmenrs are thorough and my questions get answered and that's important to me.  Now I've just got to write my facebook testimonial so I can get my free massage lol.
3 The doctors have all been nice and helpful, I would never come here if I had something seriously wrong with me though. For prescription filling and general wellness though, they work. It's always busy and they do have language interpreters on call if you speak anything from Spanish to Arabic.   Every time I've been here it's been super busy and I've had to wait 30-60 minutes. The walk-in aspect is convenient but makes everything a bit slower. The waiting room is fine, nothing special and the staff is friendly enough.
5 A Physical Therapist like no other!  I have been a patient of Sandi's since this summer.  I have been to PTs off and on for over 8 years dealing with hip pain, before and after surgery, and I finally feel like I have found someone who is making a difference.  I spent my first monsoon season without pain in my hips.  This was such a blessing!  Myofascial release is one of the best discoveries I have found; I was a skeptic at first, but I am glad Sandi convinced me to come in.  Sandi, Kim, Aleyda, and Mary are detail-oriented and a dedicated team. They have a specialized approach and plan for each patient, each time you come in.  It is specific to your needs, and your pains; they make you feel welcome and like a friend.    I refer this practice to you, as well as my friends and family.  Best wishes in your recovery.
5 Excellent staff. No long waiting to be seen. Therapy is working great!  I will continue to come here for any future needs.
5 I am updating this review... Since my original review, they have been awesome!!! I'm dealing with an illness of some sort and they've been on the ball about helping me and getting me into the office quickly and when I need to see someone for a test they called and got me in that same day even with no openings. I will keep them as my primary Dr. because of how much they've taken care of me. :-)
5 Lindsey is my partners physical therapist and she is awesome. She is very professional and knowledgeable. She is quick to answer all our concerns and provides quick and easy at home workouts. She is also very punctual and on time.
5 After having surgery in December I started coming here for therapy three times a week. The staff is professional, friendly and encouraging. Although nobody wishes to have to rehabilitate an injury, Synergy is the best place, without exception to come.
5 After researching several qualified local diabetologists, I found the reviews regarding their care, attentiveness, length of time with their patients, and desire to really hear and work with their patients to be horribly lacking. In addition, many had repeated negative reviews of their office staff, even if the doctor was satisfactory.   The many one-star ratings and bad reviews convinced me that the multiple five-star reviews for Aveon health were a rarity and helped me make the choice to meet with Dr. Fereidouni. I am so glad I did. I spoke with a person every time after a brief welcome message from the doctor, asked several questions before booking, received a prompt return call with answers, and was able to get an appointment the same day!   I spent about an hour and a half discussing my medical history and health goals. I left feeling encouraged and on a team that understood what my treatment expectations were and willing to support me in them.  The staff was friendly, the facility was immaculate, and the location is easy to get to, right near the 101 and Hayden. I highly, highly recommend Aveon Health for anyone seeking treatment for diabetes (or other health needs, that just happened to be my situation).
1 In my search for a primary care doctor I was told about this place.  I called to make an appointment and was treated poorly because the receptionist had never heard of my insurance (even though it is one they accept).  She said new patient visits were only done at 11 and 3 and that I could not be seen for anything but giving my information.  I took 3.  Upon arriving I was not greeted and waited only 2 minutes until a lady realized I was standing there waiting for my paperwork (yes, I did mark on the sign-in paper that I was a new patient). I received my paperwork and sat to fill it out.  Then I Realized, as I was being coughed on by another patient, that there is no separation of sick and well patients.  Eww!!  I was taken into a room five minutes later (yay for me!). My blood pressure was taken and the nurse asked why I was there.  I told here I was a new patient looking for a doctor (hopefully Paige Walend) and she was weirded out by the fact that nothing was wrong with me.  She left and I sat in that room for 40 minutes without anyone coming in to check on me.  I walked out of the room and asked for the copies of my papers and that I would take my business elsewhere.  This girl was helpful! She promptly got my papers and I left.   No one ever tried to talk me out of leaving or explain why the long wait.  I will not be recommending this company to anyone I know.
1 I was misdiagnosed by Dr. Nichole L Johnson.  Her misdiagnose costed me $410.00 then she reworded my phisycal  to office visit and sent me additional $30.00 invoice!! I paid $410.00, it took me 5 phone calls to Office Manager Pamela who 20 days later returned my call to only backed up wrong Dr.  As some one said "omg that is the worst Dr. In the world!" I can't help but agree!!!!
4 Das Marienhospital ist eines der großen Krankenhäuser der Stadt. Über 1000 Kinder erblicken hier das Licht der Welt (und am letzten Dienstag auch mein Töchterlein :-). Leider hat das Krankenhaus noch keine eigene Neonatologie, so dass Neugeborene mit Problemen ins Olgäle gebracht werden müssen. Die Gynäkologie und die Kreissäle wurden aber frisch renoviert und in den vierten Stock verlegt. Für (werdende) Väter gibt es übrigens die Möglichkeit des Rooming-Ins    Neben Gynäkologie bietet das Marienhospital alle "üblichen" Fachbereiche und wird von vielen Patienten sehr geschätzt.    Das Krankenhaus ist via U1 und U14, Haltestelle Schreiberstraße zuzüglich 5min Fußmarsch, sowie der Buslinie 41 (ab Feuersee/Marienplatz) gut erreichbar.
1 Dr. Gempis  was a good Dr. and this place used to be busy because of her now it is so empty. They have a new Dr. Julio he is HORRIBLE. All my mom wanted was the same perscriptions Dr. Gempis used to write. He gave us such a hard time. He wrote the perscriptions wrong twice. There was a problem when I was trying to get mine filled at a store. The store had to fax the office and he never got back to them. So my mom wasted my $70+ dollars on a Dr visit and time for NOTHING. She have no job and had to pay out of her own pocket. What ever you do don't go to Dr. Julio.
2 I just found out that if I didn't have insurance and was paying cash the splint would have costs  $75.00.  I can't believe I am penalized for having insurance.
5 I am a patient of the South Tempe office; however, I needed care and my doctor was out of the office so I was scheduled to see Kelly Harris, FNP, who was wonderful.   She has a great bedside manner, took the time to listen, make sure all my concerns and questions were answered as well as those of my family who were with me.  I've seen 2 providers with Honor Health now and am so thrilled to go somewhere that I'm not rushed out the door. I would definitely recommend her for anyone needing medical care.
5 We've been going here since August,  all i can say is my sons teacher mrs Carolyn is amazing! She has made communication with my son 1000 times easier!
5 Not quite sure how anyone can have a negative experience here. Makes me wonder what kind of service they are used to or expect? I have been going here for over 2 years now and as someone who gets sick a lot probably 6 times a year at least and every time my experience is wonderful. I normally see Heather who is just super nice and when she had some time off i saw Dana who is now (unfortunately for me as she was great too!! at a different honorhealth location. Same day appointments, bloodwork at location and very friendly front staff. All in all I always feel taken care off when I go and although I sometimes get embarrassed as i have to go quite often they always take my symptoms serious.
5 I didnt think physical therapy would do any good for me but it was my first major injury. They helped me stretch comfortably and work my muscles (hard!) in a safe supervised environment.
5 Outstanding! This was by far the most professional and the best training I have ever received. I attended the tactical mentorship phase one and two, it was life changing. The staff and the interns were truly masters of their trade. I would recommend this to everyone.
1 This company is terrible! My mom purchased a portable oxygen machine from them. It was brand new and not a cheap piece of medical equipment. However, as she suffers from pulmonary hypertension she is tied to an oxygen machine 24/7. This has naturally made her depressed and often feeling trapped. This machine was the answer to our prayers. It gave her around 4 hours of being able to be out and about without concerns of running out of air. Well, the machine has broken down three times and they've yet to replace it. They "repaired" it but it broke two times after. At this point they should replace it. However it's been a battle to get any answers from customer service and everyone she talks to makes her a different promise. It's been nothing but stress and disappointment! Avoid buying anything from this heartless unorganized company.
1 Its convenient since its near my house but to wait an hour to for the  the doctor to arrive is the worst thing ever.  Iam reconsidering coming back in here. Not only i waited for 1 hour-_-, i also arrived 30 minutes before my time..oh btw iam still waiting.  I will update what will happen in this horrible experience.
5 After searching and trying out a couple of massage places over the past several years, I finally settled into a good place.  I found Elements Therapeutic Massage when I was doing a search on Spa Finder (I had a gift certificate).  I read a few reviews and the accolades they received, so I decided to try it out.    I am a fan of their membership plan which includes a $0 membership fee and a health care plan that works with your needs.  I prepay for a reduced rate for a 55 minute massage, scheduled regularly once a month.  The best part is that if I need to go more than once a month, I would still pay the same reduced rate.  The staff at Elements are friendly and professional.  I appreciate their automated email appointment reminders, accompanied with a personal phone call.    I look forward to my monthly massages at Elements on Shea!
5 After having 3 babies, I worked with Melissa on some wrist pain I had, probably from picking up my kiddos so much.  She was able to work with me and over a period of a few visits the pain was gone.    While in the program I also noticed that they had the Ideal Protein program for weight management and decided to check that out.  Monica has been super helpful with my journey on the program and I've seen so many great results.  Not only have I lost weight but my energy is improved and I'm fitting into clothes I thought I would never wear again.  I'm getting compliments all the time now and I owe it all to the program and Monica's help.  Everyone at the center is super friendly and helpful, always willing to answer questions and help you with anything.  I highly recommend looking at OptimaLiving for your therapy and wellness needs.
5 Great place!  Ali is awesome!  I have a bad back and need deep tissue work.  My back is feeling better already!  Excellent job Ali!
5 By far the best most thorough chiropractor I've ever been to! Dr. Joseph took the time to really understand what my issues are and help make a plan to fix it.
1 The doctor is very nice but the staff working there is awful. I had to wait 3 hours one time because they didn't let the doctor know so the doctor went for lunch. The staff was not apologetic. Just laughed it off. I had to study for exams that week but my allergy was bothering me too much. Waste of time.
1 I previously left a good review, but have since left by mutual agreement. What started out as great declined rapidly to ignoring what I said, forcing me to use only compound pharmacies, labs that cost me huge amounts of money, and a monthly mortgage payment in supplements. The standard saying re: pharmaceuticals was "I'm not fond of that." What became the true epic fail was when the doctor jumped on the lyme train. The low likelihood of me having lyme was totally ignored.
4 I had a procedure done with my primary care to remove some cervical cancer cells. I went to PA to stay with my mom because I was afraid to be by myself. During my stay with her I got really dizzy and nauseous. I didnt want to go to the ER because my copay was so high and I didn't have the money at that time. I went to this urgent care because it was by my mom's house and at this point I just needed to feel better. Their bedside manner was good and they were very patient with me..I tend to whine about everything lol...but they made me feel better and he sent the nausea medicine to the pharmacy to save me a wait at the pharmacy since I didnt feel to good. I got what I needed and went on my way....I am very grateful that they took good care of me...the wait time was not too bad but it's something that is expected at an urgent care and the hospital would have took much longer like 3 times longer lol...great experience overall!
1 My family has been seeing Dr. Daulat for about 20 years now. My grandmother went to see him a week ago. My mother took my grandmother to see him and they first saw him arrive in the lobby, he didn't even acknowledge her. Both my mom and grandmother said hello! He brushed them both off in a very cold manner and proceeded to another patients room. My grandmother had an appointment to see him because she's been having serious medical issues and he's the only real doctor in this office. Needless to say, she ended up seeing a PA. Dr. Daulat is a very cold person and has no compassion for his patients! He has a really bad attitude and could care less, even for his patients that have been coming to him for 20+ years! Avoid him at all costs! We are all switching doctors!
4 Bikram Tempe offers lots of classes and a small locker room that is sufficient for a quick shower as long as you don't mind maybe having to wait 5 minutes.  I enjoyed all the instructors and immediately became hooked to Bikram Yoga.  Their comparable in cost to everyone else and a good central location.
5 What an awesome urgent care experience!  Upon my arrival with my daughter who had injured her wrist during volleyball practice they told me that the wait would be about an hour and a half.  This is typical for an urgent care so I was prepared for this...  Well, upon my check in I was greeted with a smile from the girl behind the front desk.  She took my insurance information and paper work and was very pleasant and helpful.  We ended up being called back after about a 40 min wait.  The x-ray technician was a nice young man.  He was helpful and made my 13 year old daughter feel very comfortable.  He had GREAT patient care skills.  We were then called to wait in a room and everything was clean, nice, current and up to date.  We were then seen by a Nurse Practitioner by the name of Jan.  She as so nice and very descriptive in her explanation of the fracture my daughter had.  She came back with a splint and sling for her and I was even able to get her pain medication all in that one facility.    The entire experience only took a little over an hour and I have to say I was very pleased with the staff and facility.  I am not sure why this place received bad reviews but I was happy.  Two thumbs up from this mom!
5 AMAZING!!!  That sums up my experience with Dr. Bui AND his staff!!  It felt nice to be validated instead of disregarded. To have someone listen to my concerns and address them is priceless. I highly recommend him and his office.
5 Everyone was amazing. The front desk lady was funny. All nurses were sweet. The xray tech was awesome and made me feel really comfortable. Dr.Jordan didn't give up on me, when my regular doctor misdiagnosed me.
1 These people are terrible all they did for almost two years was take my money and drive me deeper into debt the staff is rude and inconsiderate you don't even get to see the doctor you get to see in a p-n which is ridiculous considering the prices of everything and not one of my problems has been solved the only thing they did was  jack me up on medication and try to sell me their crappy vitamins. Do not go here please especially if you have real health problems.
4 I think those who have rated this one star haven't been to a doctor's office that is truly one star. The office staff has always been very professional to me (they weren't overly friendly though, but I'm okay with that). I have been in many times, and I have never had a long wait time. With a family care doctor though, I'm sure there are certain times of the year, especially during cold and flu season, when they have to over book because everyone is getting sick all at once (otherwise instead of people complaining about waiting, they'd be complaining about the office scheduling appointments days out when they need to be seen immediately).   I've seen Dr. Shockey and Dr. Bruce. I am not an easy patient. I have several medical conditions that require me to see a specialists on a regular basis, but I really needed a primary care doctor to be the central location that everything gets funneled through. This is where I ended up going. Dr. Shockey has very strong opinions and can be a bit brash. He's very analytical and data oriented. He's involved in the medical community and clinical trials. There are opinions he's had that I have not agreed with, but I never felt undermined when I voiced my concerns, especially when it's a controversial topic within the medical community. If you know you can't handle a doctor with very strong opinions, I would recommend Dr. Bruce. His communication style is a lot softer than Dr. Shockey's.   You can have your blood work done in office which is so nice. That has saved me so much time alone. I don't want to go into the details of my medical issues, but they are very competent doctors who have gone out of their way several times for my benefit. One day they squeezed me in just hours after I had called. I had a terrible headache that wouldn't go away. Worst headache I've ever had. Dr. Bruce saw me. He picked up on some neurological symptoms I was completely unaware of. He became alarmed and spoke with Dr. Shockey to get his opinion. I guess I was a little out of their league, so he called a neurologist he's friends with to get an immediate opinion. When it was apparent I needed an MRI immediately, the staff called my insurance to figure out how the process would work. They didn't have to do that, but they did. I know I made both of those doctors late for the rest of their patients that day. I'm glad they were willing to spend the extra time on me. This isn't the only occasion they've done that. Overall, I've been very happy with my medical care.
1 Beware. Dana Forte cannot be trusted. I'd rather not go into specifics but you could certainly read through the other 127 review she has that only give her an average of two stars.
5 Great staff! Shout outs to Raquel and Jordan! Great, nice, knowledgable and effective team.
5 Dr. Joseph Johnson lives his profession, meeting with him you can tell that he loves it too.  I'm 32 and healthy.  I've never been to a chiropractor before, I don't have any pain or discomfort.  I went to him because I have heard really great things from lots of people.  In our session we talked about areas I wanted to strengthen and get more flexible.  He also identified and gave lots of great advice/exercise/strengthening tips. I really trust him because his life seems to be focused around being/living healthy.
5 Where to begin, when something has been such an integral part of your health for so long.  My husband and I are constantly recommending the practice of pilates to people.  We are 64 years old.  This is an exercise program for ALL AGES.  It addresses any stiffness, alignment issues, and other body related issues a person might have.  But, while helping those issues, is giving a full-body workout, aiding in balance, helping to keep a person limber, and building wonderful muscle tone!  I have taken Pilates for about 8 years from people in various cities and I have taken from Vanessa for about three years.  Her newest studios are fabulous. Beautifully designed and conveniently located.   I can only speak of my experience taking from Vanessa.  She is well-educated on the various skeletal issues, including postural problems.  Her workouts are always tailored to how you are feeling at the time and they are ever changing and healthily challenging.  When Vanessa was looking for other instructors, she was quite selective about their training. Because of this, I would imagine that they would be excellent.  She would only accept excellence.   The reformer classes at many studios are around 6 people.  At Function, there are three to a class.  This is optimal, so that the individual attention is not lost in the crowd.  I find her pricing to be extremely fair as well.  Again, less than other studios.   We have taken from many instructors over the years due to travel and moves.  There are two instructors who definitely stand apart from the rest in their abilities...Vanessa Kelly in Tempe, and Laura Modena in Jackson, Wy.   They are the best of the best.
5 I love the folks at Mesa Chiropractic. Everyone--chiropractors and masseuses--are skilled, gentle, caring, and fun. The service is thorough, and is superior to all other chiropractic offices at which I have been treated over the years. I always leave healthier and happier than when I got there. They are not there just to relieve pain, but also to help patients rebuild/reclaim their bodies and lives through rehabilitative treatment and tips for seeking exercise and wellness activities beyond their offices. I recommend them to everyone.
5 Our family has been treated by Dr. Komar and Dr. Lara K. - awesome results...very happy that the doctors have found a way to treat chronic low back pain without the use of pain medicines/pills.  They won't stop trying until your pain is under control.  Highly recommend these guys to anybody in the same boat as we were!
4 I booked my apt. before using Yelp. Originally I checked my HMO list and some medical forums, all of whom gave Dr. Gardner very favorable reviews. When i finally checked in with Yelp I was surprised and a bit anxious to see all the negativity.   My apt. was at 1pm on a Friday before a long holiday weekend and I was surprised to find no one in the waiting area when I first arrived. I only had to wait about 15 min past my appt. time before I was called in.   The one star I took away was for the hour I sat in the back waiting to meet my Dr. and the loooong hold times when I have had to call the office since then.   On its own Dr. Gardner would garner 5 stars from me. Finally I have found a Dr. that is engaged and caring. I hate going to the Dr. and I often do not like to vocalize my issues but this Dr. got it all out in a friendly and carefree way. I can see why he takes longer to make his rounds but knowing this, I am better prepared to wait the next time. I even heard another member of staff tell him that a patient had been waiting for over an hour.   I had a Dr. a few years ago that actually used an egg timer to keep him on schedule. My copay was all of $10 so my 6 minutes of face time was almost a bargain even if it was laughable.   This practice's issues seems to be more about time management and booking too many appointments than a lack of quality Dr's. I have some Dr. friend's who had to exit NV due to notoriously low reimbursement levels and high malpractice premiums. How does a small office like this one stay profitable?   Id rather wait for a caring Dr. sans the egg timer than hurry along and drop dead from neglect.
5 I can't say enough good things about Superior Spine Care. It was a bit of kismet how I ended up there. I had thrown out my back and was in terrible pain. After calling everyone in town to get a massage, everyone was booked up. I called SSC the next day and got in to see Dr. Neil. He got me on the right path and then I also started seeing Chrissy for physical therapy. Unlike a lot of chiropractic offices who push supplements and unnecessary visits, SCC really wants to get you better fast. On top of their amazing work, they are truly some of the nicest people you would ever want to meet. Courtney (who mans the front desk) is always so upbeat and personable as well. I highly recommend them.
1 Unbelievable.  It's 5pm on a Sat.  I have a page out of the Teacher's Health Trust that says they are open to 7pm.  My 9-year old daughter has strep. What is that, 5 minutes to write a prescription?  They said the doctor is there alone, so they want to clear out the office.  Nice way to care about your fellow man, heartless bastards!  What goes around comes around. Hope you get what you deserve over there!
1 Unbelievable the slowest place I have ever been I have to give 1 star because they yelp does not offer zero stars
5 I was referred by another Physical Therapist to see Jeff Dietrich at the Family & Sports Physical Therapy.  I had a nasty break in my upper arm/shoulder area and opted out of surgery.  I found the staff to be competent, friendly and very professional.  High praises go out to Jeff and his team for making me feel comfortable and at home.  My arm overall feels so much better thanks to Jeff's efforts.  I highly recommend you give them a call if you're looking for excellent service in physical therapy and someone you can trust will do their very best for your well being.
5 I have been seeing Dr. Shafer for the last 4 years. 30 plus years ago I had shoulder surgery that had become painful and lost range of motion. Dr Shafer operated and replaced part of my shoulder and cleaned up the rest. The desired result was to relieve the pain I was experiencing. The results have exceeded those expectations!!!!! I'm not only pain free but have regained full range of motion. Dr Shafer is a Professional. I swear by him and  suggest him to all I encounter.
5 I have been a patient of Dr Sam Fereidouni for years.  I followed him from his days at Arrowhead health. He's amazing.  He's put customer service first.  He's hired the best staff. They are warm, courteous and professional.  I drive 30 miles each way because of the great care they provide.
1 I called Nevada Family Care and was advised that our Prescription was sent to Walmart on Eastern and Serene. WHAT?! I wrote Walgreens on Eastern and Windmill. So they sent it to the wrong place. They didn't even apologize and just advised that they have now sent the prescription to Walgreens.....wow. Sadly I have to do a follow-up on the x-ray scans I had of my foot and ankle,so I will have to go back. Hopefully my experience is a better one, but if not. Once I find out what's wrong with my foot, I'm going somewhere new.
1 They don't care at all! The patients wait 40 min to use the toilet! There not given their medication unless patient asks for them. You never see a doctor, they suck insurance dry. Patients push call button and nurses never show up! Do not ever admit anyone to this place. It reminds me of the movie "One Flew Over The Kookoos Nest!
4 I initially rated them as 1 star because Dr. Hogan's staff ignored my pleas for help and never provided me with pain medication after I went through radio frequency ablasion, in which case made me feel like I was just a number to them.  However, I believe in being fair and providing honost feedback. I am now 90% pain free and I consider the procedure done by Dr. Hogan a success. He did tell me right before he was going to do the procedure that it could take up to 4 weeks to notice results. It was 2 weeks for me. Unfortunately, those were two of the most painful 2 weeks I have ever had to endure and I wish Dr. Hogan or someone from his office would have given me some type of medication to relieve my pain. It was so bad I was out of work for days. The only thing that relieved my pain was just laying down. I don't wish that on anyone.   Hopefully by posting this review either Dr. Hogan and/or his staff will make adjustments and address this issue so it doesn't happen to others.   In sum, you will have to outweigh the pros and cons. Dr. Hogan does a great job at radio frequency ablasion but thereafter there is no immediate follow up and there is lots of pain. If you are already on pain medications or Dr. Hogan can prescribe you some immediately after the procedure or right before (just in case you experience pain after) than I would recommend him.
5 Dr. Lopez-Benitez is such a great doctor! I've been wanting to try out the Nexplanon since I'm not very good at remembering to take the pill. After some research, I found this doctor who happens to be right next to my house! The ladies at the front are so sweet and make scheduling and paperwork such a breeze. They let you know beforehand about any charges or changes. My first consultation with Dr. Lopez-Benitez was also a great experience! He informed me of all the different contraceptive options in detail, and helped me feel comfortable with my decision. Today, I had my insertion and unfortunately, he wasn't feeling too well. Even through his migraine and allergies, he performed a great procedure. He let me know how to take care of everything for the next few days and to come back if any problems arise. I had a very comfortable experience. Thank you again, Dr!
1 Medical treatment was denied not once, but TWICE. All because the people who answer the phones rush you to get off the phone and won't listen to your concerns. Furthermore, goodness forbid they don't get to go home early. This treatment is unacceptable and I will be finding a new primary care physician who cares if I live or die because obviously the staff here does not.
1 Dr. Young was condescending and overconfident when my husband came to him for help. He has had severe chronic back pain for the past year and has tried everything imaginable to resolve the problem, including months of physical therapy. He has a sedentary office job and has noticed that sitting exacerbates the pain, while being mobile relieves it. When he suggested this to Dr. Young, Dr. Young laughed in his face and said he just needs to go back to physical therapy.
4 So you know when you're asleep and you have one of those terrifying dreams where you have the feeling of falling into a black abyss? You're in control and not all at the same time? You eventually wake up unsettled and wondering if it was due to the tacos you had for dinner or because you polished off the expired egg salad while reading the National Enquirer. Wouldn't it be great to have complete control over that feeling while being naked and wet?   Well look no further! Allure Floatspa lets you replicate that feeling minus the terror in a controlled environment.  I've never floated before and this was a new experience. Chris the owner/operator was very helpful in explaining what to expect as well as ensuring me how clean they kept the facility. The float room we entered was indeed clean and had everything you would need. There was a shower with body wash and shampoo which you're asked to clean yourself before getting in the water to keep the float water clean and to shower again after the float to rinse off the salt.  Towels, bathrobes and a hair dryer readily available.  For the float session you can have music playing (theirs or yours) while you float or complete silence. So you can rock out to Adele or 10,000 Maniacs. Also you can have various soothing lights on or complete darkness. The water was heated to about body temperature and no matter how hard I tried to sink the salt in the water kept me afloat.  We opted for silence and no lights to achieve a near state of complete sensory deprivation so our minds could wander without the nuisance of the five senses and enter a hallucinogenic state where creativity, the subconscious, and unicorns mingle to allow one to have great epiphanies on what to tackle next in life or how to get the red wine stain out of the white carpet. I'll admit it takes a little getting used to fully relax and let go of any muscle tension since in the beginning you're not really convinced you won't sink and drown in a salty marinade, but after a while you learn to just let go and henceforth the feeling and thoughts of nothingness appears.  That quote from J.M. Barrie (Peter Pan) "You know that place between sleep and awake, that place where you still remember dreaming?...." That's where your mind goes. The feeling is surreal.  Afterwards you get out feeling like a new man or woman or whatever. You shower and are greeted at the front by Chris with water and snacks at the ready.  Bottomline: if you've never done this before you should give it a go and if you're in the area Allure Floatspa is a great option.  Bonus fact - The water is shark and gluten free!  https://youtu.be/OVa7Qvslvhs
1 Absolutely the worst service. We had 2 appointments at 3 for radiology,  per Dr. Pervaiz and they didn't see us until after 4. We also signed my daughter in to be seen through urgent care at 3:15(there was no one else in the office at all) and then someone came in behind us, they took them before us for all of our appointments. The individual was another walk in patient.  The staff stated they would take us back for the walk in appointment after the radiology appointments were done,  then someone else walked in and they took him back right away.  Very poor management and ignorant, worthless staff.
5 I love Dr Adams. Yes there is a long wait, but I know this and am okay with this because I know the quality of care I am getting.
1 We requested the visit early in the morning, it is past midnight and doctor has not shown up yet (even though we were told he would be here anywhere from 2pm-10pm) If you really feel ill, go to a walk in clinic!!
3 Drs. Sassano and Didich are dedicated and caring. However, if you need professional office staffing perhaps for let's say oh, a freakin' prescription! Then don't be in a hurry. 19 hours, 4 phone calls and two office visits plus getting pissed off is probably the only way you'll get your medication in a timely manner. If you dare go, ALWAYS walk out with the RX in your hand.
5 Very centrally located Great office staff positive attitude physical therapist are AAA+ and they do great work with children definitely a five-star facility  Thanks guys you rock!!!
1 This office is terrible. The doctors are qualified but their office staff is complete brain damage to work with. In the past 2 years we have not been able to get in if we we(or a child) was sick in short time so we always end up at urgent care.    Last week they would not make an appointment by phone(against policy unless it is for the same week) and won't accept an appointment in person(happened to be in the building). Directed us to website. We used website(took a screen shot) and when I showed up for the appointment they said the appointment was not in system(evidently there is an extreme verification process in addition to the 30 minutes to manually fill in all your information.).  When I explained the difficulty the office person said sorry :(. Would I like to make another appointment?    When I escalated to office manager she asked what I was there for and when I explained high blood pressure she almost laughed.  Again, wait 30 minutes to say nothing will be done as they have plenty of patients.   I see the irony. If you don't want to stroke out from  of a "I don't give a shot attitude" move on from these clowns.
4 I decided to try out Zen massage for my birthday and want to say I had a great experience.   Dawn was great at deep tissue and I will be returning again as a repeat customer!
1 The front desk girls at the higley and southern location are ALWAYS HUGE FUCKING ASSHOLES I will never go here again and I will make sure to tell every human I come into contact with to never go there either. They all act like it is an inconvenience to help patients, hello that's your job! Maybe fucking smile and take the stick out of your ass. Dr. Coury is great though love him. If I was him I would fire them all, or at least give them some training in customer service. everyone at the country club location is much nicer!
5 I have seen both Dr. Collins and Dr. Jeppesen. Dr. Collins fixed my severely broken leg and did an amazing job. I was so lucky that he was on call the night of my injury. He is a great surgeon. In the office, he was very kind and considerate. He answered all my questions and explained anything that I did not understand. Based on Dr. Collins' referral, I saw Dr. Jeppesen for ankle issues on the same leg - it had become constricted because it was held immobile for so long. Dr. Jeppesen was also very kind and did an amazing job. I would recommend both doctors to my family and friends.
5 Amazing Doctors, Amazing Staff!! Went there for the first time last week. I walked in and the front office was very clean and well organized. The two girls up front were very polite, helpful and pleasant. It took them just a few minutes to check me in before I got called back. The M.A. was super sweet and very nice. I did see Dr. Perales in the hallway, she smiled and said hi. I met with Dr. Donesa-Zuzak. She was very nice, listen to everything I had to say and never felt rushed. She is very caring and so professional. I've worked in the medical field for many years I can definitely say this office was amazing!
1 I would not recommend this place to anyone. I recently moved down to Phoenix from Seattle and was looking for a new doctor's office to call "home". Dr. Sethi was given to me on a list from my insurance. Her, and her staff, are incompetent and rude. I've never had such an unpleasant experience at a doctor's office. Avoid at all costs!  Also- don't just take my word for it, ready the 10 other 1 star reviews before mine.
5 I have been a patient of Gilbert Physical Medicine for about 15 months now in response to a shoulder injury. From the moment I walked in, I was welcomed with warmth and genuine care from every staff member. Everyone I've worked with has been attentive and friendly. Dr. Cassady answers my incessant questions without making me feel silly or rushed. The doctors and Nurse Practitioners explain everything thoroughly so I can make the best decision for my health. I definitely know way more about anatomy which I highly appreciate! The office manager, Cole, is a wiz! She's knowledgeable and it's clear that patient satisfaction is her priority. The massage therapist is very sweet and passionate about healing others. Excellent masseuse! I am pleased with the progress and definitely recommend this business!
5 Excellent Pilates studio. Vanessa leads and guides very well. She caters to the individual and watches to be sure you understand and that form is correct. But, it's not in an intimidating way. I've had instructors watch me in the past so intensely that it ruins an experience. But it's just not like that here. And Mae is just awesome as well! She challenges me! And I love it!
1 Horrible experience! I wish my surgeon have chosen a better facility for his patients , considering the fact that patients paying cash for it. Worst service ever! I was there to recover after my surgery. I was in excruciating pain and called the nurse. It took her 40 min to get to me another 30 min to administer. All the staff seem to be cold with " do not care" attitude. I would never stay here if it wouldn't be my surgeon choice
5 I got a prenatal massage by Shannon. It was wonderful! One of the best massages of my life! And they are reasonably priced! 4 of us were able to get same day appointments. Very clean, warm tables & inviting staff. If I lived here I'd come here at least once a month.
1 Having a scheduled appointment has no regard in this office.   If you are prepared to wait over two hours after your scheduled appointment to then be offered to be seen by a different doctor because "he's running really late"....then you will have no complaints...otherwise you will be infuriated and waste your time.   For my appointment at 11am I waited in the lobby then was taken inside and instructed to wait some more in a patient room, of course after having paid my copay.  After waiting a total of 2.5 hours I was fed up and decided to leave.  As I walked out of my patient room Dr. George Constantine saw me and walked up behind me, with a demeanor of being annoyed and stated "if you want me to see you now I will, otherwise you can make another appointment.  I have a business to run!"  There was no apology for making me wait so long, no excuse offered only an air arrogance and an attitude of "take it or leave it!"  No respect or regard for the patient's time nor acknowledgment that you as the patient are the paying customer.  have now requested my medical records and will be seeing another primary care physician.     I'm an RN in a busy emergency department in town and our average time for turning over patients is under two hours... we have no appointment process and no control of the inflow of patients!  If an emergency room can turn over patients in under two hours I don't think it's an unrealistic expectation to at least be seen by your physician in his office in under two hours for a schedule appointment!     Dr. Constantine's is a great practitioner, and when I first started seeing him as he was starting his practice I was very happy but now that he's established and continues to grow....everything I valued about him has been diminished if not eliminated.
1 The doctor makes the patient come back multiple time just to recieve the initial treatment. Wont give a referal without a seperate appoinyment and makes you wait hours just for a simple paper referal.
5 Dr. Williams and this office are awesome! Everyone I talked to was so friendly and attentive. The office is contemporary and clean. Dr. Wililams was so patient even with someone like me who has so many medical problems and asks so many questions. She is a very humble person and genuinely listened to my concerns. I highly and happily recommend Dr. Williams, so I am going to bring my parents to see her as well!
5 It's amazing, after only four weeks two of my daughters health issues have cleared up after seeing Dr. Melanie.  Her expert knowledge in nutrition and ability to connect with her patients has far exceeded my expectations.   With one having digestive problems (21 yrs) and the other with thyroid issues (19 yrs), the analysis of their blood work revealed amazing and startling results that without going to Dr. Melanie we would have never known. Thank you Dr. M.
5 I've been coming here for 12 years.   The P.A.'s are fantastic. I will often see Julie and she will order enough tests to get the job done. Others may order every test imaginable.   Dr. Curtis Page (son) and Dr. Robert Page (father) are the two doctors in the office. They are all competent and capable of diagnosing. I personally have never seen Robert Page, but Curtis Page is quick and intuitive when treating his patients.   I have come to trust completely that they pick the best possible P.A.'s to treat their patients. It may be difficult to pin down The Doctors, but the P.A.'s are there to fill the space for a huge amount of patients, and when extreme diagnoses are not required.   The other review on here seems to not trust P.A.s, but I ensure you they are competent and will refer you to the doctor if something is beyond their scope of treatment. They are not pill pushers, and when they do provide a drug it has always been something perfect for my needs.  Sometimes they may take awhile, but they take their time with each patient. I would rather wait a little longer to see them, than be pushed out the door with a drug in hand. They used to guarantee fast service, but no longer do. They simply guarantee great healthcare.
5 First off: the staff at Backfit is awesome. I've been doing physical therapy here with Kristen and Lisvany for my neck pain--mostly caused by TMJ--and they have helped me a lot. My pain level is much lower and I've noticed an improvement in my posture which is a plus. I was told previously by another doctor that I may need surgery on my jaw but I feel that the program I'm doing here might be sufficient (fingers crossed).      They also offer medical massages here which is super convenient to have all in one spot. Stephanie is the massage therapist I've been seeing and she is simply amazing. She must have treated a fair few TMJ patients because she knows exactly what to do to fix jaw pain.       Overall, I've had a very positive experience here and feel like the people I've interacted with care about their patients and their work.
5 I am really impressed with how responsive Nelson Pediatric Therapy has been in getting me set up for speech therapy for my twin boys.  The last few years with the whole pregnancy thing, and new twins has been packed with dr. visits, surgeries, pre ops, post ops, eye appointments.. so many visits!! We have had some good experiences with front offices, but mostly bad. It's probably a 1 out of 10 good experience ratio we are talking here.  My experience with the Nelson Pediatric Therapy office was easily the best I have had when dealing with healthcare. Clarysa in Records is who I have coordinated with the most, and she is rad. Super responsive.. calls me, emails me.. She makes sure all my questions are answered. She kicks butt at her job, and my life is a little easier for it. Nelson is blessed to have her, and if the treatment is any reflection of how their front office is run, then I will be satisfied.   Also, Wendy with Billing helped me out with some insurance stuff too and she, like Clarysa was on top of it.   I will update after we have had therapy.. but so far, this place is excellent.
4 I absolutely love Dr Broines and her nurse. Dr Broines talks to you like your a person and will have you laughing so hard. She's an amazing doctor. She takes the time to listen to you and does not make you feel rushed. I just wish her front office staff was a little more efficient. I am so thankful to have come across Dr. Broines and I will continue to see her as long as I live in Arizona. She really cares about her patients in a genuine way.
3 Apparently I was not the only one to complain about lost tests. Husband had a med check and expressed how unimpressed we were with the service I received. He was assured that a change in office staff had occurred since my incident. Considering returning to practice as a patient.
5 Friendly staff! Dr. Homewood is amazing doctor! Highly recommended to anyone looking for a Board Certified Doctor.
5 Family owned and run. Not only is the office amazingly organized and modern but has a unbelievably friendly staff. Dr. Dye is the most out going, influential individual. He really takes the time to go out of his way and go the extra mile to make that personal connection with all of his clients. Definitely will be going back every week. Thank you Dr. Dye!!
1 Very long wait time and no return calls from Nurse when you leave a voicemail.  The pharmacy requested a different prescription for days via phone and fax, as I did. Call your patients back.
1 So finally after waiting around for way more hours for this doctor than I ever should have, I made the decision on surgery day to cancel and to find another doctor.  This guy was late on surgery day, which just reeks of a consistent lack of respect for the patient.  I mean, you are requiring patients to have someone pick you up after surgery - that means two people are unable to work that day.. shouldn't you at least try to be on time for surgery?  You're not giving an official time until less than 24 hours before.  So you have plenty of time to make sure you're giving yourself enough time and to not overbook.  I was more than willing to ignore the fact that this office told the imaging center to take an MRI of the wrong shoulder.  And after getting the MRI, when it was obvious that pills and injections weren't helping, they suggested more injections and coming back for another appointment.  Meaning more wasted time.  Enough is enough - please have some respect for your patients.  I'm going to add a review for Dr. Bigler who eventually performed surgery on my shoulder - I'd highly recommend going to see him.
1 I was sent here as part of my PI case last year.  Prepare to wait awhile appointments are never taken back on time.  I've been calling for the past week attempting to get a copy of my medical bills.  I left five messages with no return calls. When I finally got someone she said she would email to my email account on file while we were on the phone.  Nothing came.    Five hours later I called back and this biller was incredibly rude and said I cannot request anything I should call my attorney. When I explained that is not legal as I am the patient I just want my bill she had me fax a request with a copy of my DL and said it would be processed within 24 hours. That was four days ago.  I never met Dr R just had PAs each visit and a different one every time.  Do not come here. Their staff is rude and incompetent.
5 I bought my wife a massage with Lisa. She said it was one of the best, if not the best she ever had. My wife was very impressed with Yellow Gazebo and would happily recommend it to anyone. A great addition to the neighbourhood. If my wife likes it, I like it. Thumbs up!
5 I had a sore throat and was traveling out of the country the next day.  It should be known that I hate getting my throat swabbed and almost threw up on the assistant...  poor thing!  I made some jokes to the PA, Alexandra Leguire (who is absolutely awesome),  we laughed a bit and she got me fixed right up.    Other facts: -  They are also able to provide certain medications onsite, which makes it easy to get everything taken care in one place.  -  Additionally, we used this location when my son needed a sports physical.  It was inexpensive and quick.    I highly suggest going to this location and getting taken care of when you are under the weather (or for physicals)...
5 I've been a patient here for a few years. Originally started at the first office and now prefer this location. I enjoy the walk in option and fast service. All providers are very well educated and speak to you in a language you can understand.  :) very clear with action plans and great at following up. I will continue  seeing Dr. Ferguson & staff as long as I can!
1 I have had an absolute terrible time trying to get my daughter in for even just an evaluation. I have been waiting for a month for her to be seen and NO ONE can get her in. It's incredibly frustrating. They can't give you estimates so you just have to call in. Each call goes through the same series of questions and at the end of the questions they say "thanks for the info--we have nothing open. Better luck next time!"
5 Amazing therapist, I had given up on regaining mobility and was living in constant pain, these guys never gave up until they found a way to get me back going again.  K2 and Chad are awesome and the whole staff is friendly and professional.   If I could give them more stars I would and I constantly recommend them to people.
5 I have went to Dr. Francyk for the past few years.  He is always professional, honest and informative.  I am never rushed and he answers all of my questions.  He is a Dr. that takes his time and listens to you.  I highly recommend him.
1 I hate to give this office one star but they really don't deserve anything more. Dr. Dahlia is great but her staff is horrible. So horrible I had to change doctors.
5 This is my second time here now and the staff here is great. I have had Amanda both times and she knows exactly what she is doing. She asks questions about where you're bothered the most and always keeps a conversation going with you and makes sure you are always comfortable. I think business for this new location will do just fine.
5 My 4 yr old son went here for 6 to 12 months for speech therapy. He is now at level and doing great in kindergarten. He saw 2 different therapists - don't recall the names - but both were great. We tried another place called Arizona Advanced Therapy before this that we didn't like much, but we can definitely recommend this place...
5 just started with dr, deshazo been to him twice.so far me and my wife like him a lot.makes you feel very comfortable.he asked many questions about me since a new patent. nice waiting ares also.wait time wasn't very long to wait with a appointment maybe 5 minutes.having hard time getting my records from my other dr. to him.one of the reasons  for changing drs. we both like his nurse and the girls in front office.big difference from our last doctor.
1 EOS fitness is worst gym I have been to. I was originally a member of Golds and decided to stay when it was sold to EOS. The staff are not that friendly but who would be with a change over every few weeks. There appears to one cleaning lady who barely does that. The gym smells like bleach and butt... The bathrooms are horrible. I have saw bloody napkins in the trash and witnessed people spitting in the trash... This is beyond nasty and a health hazard. The owners or owner should be ashamed. Let's not forget the old or broken equipment that rarely gets fixed or replaced.. On a rainy day forget it because you can't move around from the amount of trash bins collecting water and paper towels on the floor...Stop the $1 dollar promotion because you have changed the quality of the gym. After writing this long review I realized that I shouldn't complain but leave and find a better place... I encourage others to do the same if you have to loose a few bucks... LVAC here I come...
1 I brought my first daughter here 5 years ago. She wasn't gaining weight. Then we started formula and she gained the weight she should have and the doctor told us to stop feeding her when she is hungry. We were told to space it out and deal with the crying. I left that doctor immediately. 5 years later my daughter is the perfect weight and height.
5 Have been coming to see dr. Kim for some time now. The staff is always friendly and the office is immaculate. He is by far the best doctor I  have had in a long time. Very knowledgeable and he has a great bed side manner. Would highly recommend.
2 You will wait, and wait, and wait, and wait. Hey, did I mention you will wait?! Whether you are a scheduled appointment or a walk-in, plan an hour and a half wait time to even be called back. Do not expect to be contacted with lab results...be prepared to follow-up by contacting the office to inquire about test results YOURSELF. Be prepared to listen to medical assistants talk about patients and accounts of patients in earshot of other patients. If you can ignore the negative aspects of this practice such as, unprofessional, unhelpful staff, long waits, poor customer service, and never any open blinds in the depressing, ugly waiting room, then this is at least one place to go to when you really need medical care because quality medical care staff, practices, service, and facilities are far and in between in Las Vegas.
3 Dr. Mary Andrews is great. Their staff and manager, heather, always have a bad attitude. No smiles, no greetings, no thank yous. just constant rbf.
5 I have nothing but amazing things to say about my experience at Dr. Mioni's office!  I was in a car accident last year, and Dr. Mioni gave me exceptional care throughout the entiree process.  His staff were all so kind and professional, appointments were easy to schedule, and the treatment was very effective.  My neck was in pretty bad shape after the accident, but with Dr. Mioni's help, I have healed up very well!    I check Yelp frequently before trying new doctors because good care really does make all the difference.  I enthusiastically give him a 5 star review and highly recommend him if you are looking for a knowledgeable, reliable, and friendly chiropractor in Tempe!
5 I love this place. They get you in fast and don't waste your time. Shanna is great and made me feel very comfortable. I'm excited that we finally have found a great family practice.
5 I have been seeing Dr Batlan for about 3 years. He is an amazing pain management  doctor. Takes the time to listen, knowledgeable and friendly. He cares and will do what it takes to help in your pain management. Staff is awesome and helpfully. I highly recommend  him and you  taking the time to see what he has to offer you. I don't usually recommend  anyone but this Doc and staff are the best.
1 This review is about three years over due. Dr. Lopez has got to be the worst obgyn doctor in town. My first visit was horrible from the start. Staff is rude and act  annoyed that you're in the office. Dr. Lopez said I needed to have a surgery and should save some eggs to find a friend to carry my baby for me. And I could end up needing to have a hysterectomy if surgery went bad. Luckily I didn't listen to him and went to another doctor for a second opinion. Turns out it was an easy surgery and I now have my son thanks to the other doctor. Please avoid him at all cost. And whatever he tells you please get a second opinion.  I would give zero stars if I could. I've heard from two other women how to tried to ruin their lives with unnecessary procedures.
5 5 Stars are not easy to come by in my book, but I have no hesitation to give Dr. Le 5 stars. If I could, I would give him more!  I have searched for a primary care for years and every one I saw was in a rush, did not seem to care, made me feel like I was a burden, or a combination of those things and more. Recently I needed to see a primary care doctor ASAP. Meaning I needed an appointment in the next 24 hours. Even so, in hopes of finding a great physician who had immediate availability, I decided to really take the time to search for a doctor. I read reviews (on multiple sites!), checked the number of reviews they received (if they got 1 5 star review on 1 site, that is an easy fake. No one  will take the time to fake 20+ reviews on multiple sites just for a rating), etc. After hours of searching for a doctor who not only had great feedback, but somehow the miracle of an opening NOW, I came across Dr. Le. He was one of three 5 star docs that I ended up choosing from at the end. It was his smile in his photo that made the decision. I made an appointment for the next day.   As a new patient, you expect a certain level of expedience from your doc being as he probably has a regular patient waiting, and may not want to waste time on a new one that may never come back. This was not the case with Dr. Le. Within moments of him entering the room, we were already laughing. He took the time to ask me the important questions, but more importantly, he let me talk. He let me tell my story. He didn't just listen though, he counseled and advised. You can tell he genuinely cares about every patient that walks in his office and honestly believes that his mission in life is to help others. His intellect and welcoming energy are a combination that is nearly impossible to find in a doctor.   If you are even considering seeing him, don't even hesitate. Come back and thank me later :)
5 I am super excited and impressed with the progress made after three appointments!  I had been going to physical therapy following surgery and when I went to Dr. Eric, I felt discouraged and disheartened.  I was told that I would probably never be able to improve my range of motion.  I already have an improved range of motion as well functionality.  Dr. Eric and Afam have been incredible in working with me. They are upbeat, positive and very encouraging.    I feel I will get my quality of life back and highly recommend Impact Physical Therapy.  I am so very grateful -thank you!
5 I've been to a lot of walk-in clinics in the past, and I really liked this one the most! So far, I have only had good experiences at this clinic. They have some specialists in the building as well, so if your doctor ever gives you a referral to a specialist, you may not need to travel far. Location and hours of operation are also convenient for someone who works 9-5.
4 15-20 minute waiting time, but I think there was only one doctor. Everyone is really nice and the doctor was helpful. I'd come here again. Facility is spacious and clean.
5 I've been seeing Dr. Korcal for years.  It takes a bit of time to get to know each other.  (He's actually a nice guy although possibly a little shy)   I've found Dr. Korcal to be a good listener, practical and open to questions, ideas and suggestions.  He often knows about alternative or homeopathic things you might want to try.  After going through a myriad of specialists that did nothing but suck every penny out of me, Dr. Korcal and I worked to manage my condition to a point where it's just routine now.  I've never had a problem with his staff.  There was a bit of confusion about blood work. I got charged another office visit for blood work while I was there.  I think it is because the facility has different businesses co-located so it may be behind the same door, but lab is separate.  had that been explained to me in advance, i would have been OK with it.  It was just the surprise that kind of irked me.  Overall, if you want a good family practice doctor that's open minded and your willing to build a relationship (which you should have with any doctor unless you rarely see him/her) Dr. Korcal is great.  I'm not exactly a spring chicken and he's my favorite doctor every
4 We came to this facility for a second opinion ENT for my husband. He's currently dealing with ear issues and we FINALLY got some clear answers!! After already having a few surgeries, he's going in for more. The doctor, nurse and entire staff were amazing!! They took the time to explain everything and even let me look in the giant telescope that was in his ear. She then explained why all of the stuff was broken and needs to be rebuild both ears AND drums.   Parking was a piece of cake, the facility was super clean. We can't wait to get all of this resolved. 3 or 4 more surgeries and it should all be done. Thanks UH!
1 I have been a patient of Dr. Doug (Douglas L. Cunningham) for many years.  I use to see him from the age of 19-23 at his Scottsdale location.  Unfortunately he only sees patients at this location one day a week.  I changed insurance for a few years and couldn't see him anymore.  But about 8 years ago I got new insurance and went back to seeing him, however in his Phoenix location.  BEWARE to all.  His office is a human cattle call.  Several times I have had to cancel my appointment only to find out that his scheduling staff didn't bother to remove me from the schedule and then I was charged for a no show fee of $35 at least 12 times in 8 years.  I am NOT asthmatic, but every time I go into his office they insist that I get a breathing treatment.  I was put on testosterone therapy, and with my old physician he taught me how to give myself the shots, but Dr. Cunningham says he wouldn't prescribe testosterone for self administration because I might be tempted to use the needles for other drugs.  EXCUSE ME??? I'm not a drug user and was being treated like one.  6 months ago Dr. Doug ordered an MRI STAT, which I knew required prior authorization from my insurance.  I figured it would take 48-72 hours to obtain this, not 18 days.  When does 18 days equal STAT?  Then when I called after a week of waiting insisting that something be done, his office manager called me and proceeded to YELL at me over the phone about how I made her staff nervous and close to crying.  I'm sorry, but this is my health we are talking about.  I don't really care who I make cry to get a STAT test done in an adequate time frame.  When I finally got the MRI, I asked the facility to see the authorization form only to find out it had been approved 3 days after the order and Dr. Doug's office had sat on the authorization for 15 days.  My final straw was last week.  Monday I saw Dr. Doug for a routine check up and blood work, everything was fine.  2 days later I woke up with a sinus infection and ear infection (which I get 4-6 times a year and have most of my life).  I called the office requesting an antibiotic and ear drops only to be told someone would have to call me back.  No one called back that day so I called on Thursday, I was told I would have to be seen even though I had just seen him 3 days prior.  The soonest I could be seen was a week away.  I said unacceptable and demanded Dr. Doug call me back.  Of course no one did.  Friday I called 6 times trying to get some medication only to be told NO NO NO NO NO NO NO.  I finally went to the office in tears begging for something.  I was given a mild antibiotic and told that was all I was going to get.  Over the weekend I spiked 102 and 103 degree temps and finally went to an urgent care only to be told the infection was so bad I needed and antibiotic IV infusion.  I filed a formal complaint with my insurance and with the Arizona Board of Medical Examiners today and am in the process of changing my Primary Care Physician.  I wouldn't recommend this office or Dr. Cunningham or any other provider in his office to my worst enemy unless being treated with total disrespect and like a drug addict is your forte.
1 This place is an abomination. I have been a resident here for over a month, trying to get a shower here is pretty much impossible, even though I request them on the two days a week they decide to shower us. I have had 2 showers and 1 bed bath since my check in. The occupational therapy is pretty much a joke. They don't teach you anything on how to do for yourself outside of the hospital, they simply show you mediocre exercises you can YouTube or Google and ignore you. So basically they are stealing from insurance by saying they are doing therapy when you could do the same things in your room and not wasting your insurances money on hokey exercises designed to cheat insurances. They won't contact your physician no matter how many times you tell them to. I checked in and told them of an appointment 3 weeks out and the day before the appointment after asking numerous times for X-rays for the appointment they said they knew nothing of the appointment and scrambled trying to get X-rays and transportation set up. When I got to my appointment they forgot to send my X-rays with me! I called the hospital and spoke to the Director of Nursing Tonya Hampton and she said they just wanted the finalized report not the X-rays... As the doctor is asking me at the appointment for the much needed X-rays. If you need pain meds or just your call light answered be prepared to wait anywhere from 45 minutes and up while the nurses congregate around the nursing station ignoring the lights and buzzing sounds informing them of patients in need. I even asked them if they were going to get the buzzing noises or blinking lights only to get the response if "someone is down there, they will get to it." They also run out of your medication on occasion only to tell you tough they will get it in later.  The nurses here do not understand HIPAA (patients personal information and treatment disclosure basically) and when they get upset they talk about you and your treatment to patients. I got this first hand when Dorothy told me about a lazy patient with pnuemonia at the end if my hall. When you inform the Director of Nursing or Director of the hospital they don't do anything about the nurses but they will try to discharge you even before your insurance runs out by saying therapy can longer help your condition. They do move a little when you say you will contact outside services and corporate... Once again after they will try to discharge you. This is even when you are in a wheelchair with nobody to help at home with care or treatment and they never trained you in therapy to be prepared to leave. (Yes even though your insurance paid then $45 every 15 minutes if therapy). So if you want subpar treatment from a center that only looks at you as a paycheck then this is the place for you. (Even the nurses here talk about how your only a paycheck... And how they are totally understaffed because Tonya got rid of employees (shower aid... Remember 2 showers one bed bath 4 weeks with therapy 6 times a week) and never supplied them with the promised extra aid so they are running back and forth trying to pick up the slack from other nurses who don't want to work). The Director is 29 years old and has no clue what he is doing in my opinion. The Director of Nursing is just as bad. Hopefully you read this and do not make the mistake a lot of us patients did by coming to this hell hole run by incompetent leadership.  To say I hate La Estancia with all my heart and soul would pale in comparison to how I really feel.  I'm guessing the review from Carol K is fabricated by a family friend of the staff. Everyone I talk to here have nothing nice to say about this place.  Also things tend to come up missing here... From food that only the staff has access to, along with a sweatshirt taken out of my room. Things here seem to grow legs.
1 Absolutely horrible!!!!! A family member and I were treated hostilely and unprofessionally for their mistakes and discrepancies!!!! His assistant Richard called screamed, talked down to my family member and I on many occasions for their mistakes!!!!! The worst experience we have ever had with a doctor and their staff!!!!
3 Friendly staff but not very fast. Left pondering the use of the word "urgent." There were only a two patients ahead of us but our visit still took more than an hour.
3 My review is for the ER only.    1st visit - a few years back my husband had a really bad eye issue that was causing lots of pain.  We only waited maybe 10 minutes to be seen and the doc got him settled, his pain managed, and referred to an eyecare specialist to take care of the rest.  2nd visit - Husband experienced severe abdominal pain that came on suddenly.  We again visited the ER, which had us back and my man in a bed with a doctor taking a urine sample very quickly.  They diagnosed him with a kidney stone and sent us on our way.  3rd visit - neighbor had severe kidney stones.  I took him to the hospital and waited with him in the ER for maybe 5 - 10 minutes before they saw him.  You'll have to ask him his thoughts, I am not sure he enjoyed his stay much but that could be because of the severe pain....  4th visit (I need frequent flyer points or something!) - Husband cut his hand really badly with a box cutter in a tough place to stich up.  Since this is the most recent visit, it is the most memorable.  The ER front desk staff were absolutely disengaged and could really care less.  No passion for their jobs or desire to make a terrible experience even a little bit better.  The girl tried to hand my husband, who was holding his severely cut hand with the other hand and dripping blood on the floor, the clipboard to fill out paperwork.  Hello?!?!  Are we awake???    26 stitches later, hubby was all fixed up and we had a good referral to a hand specialist who could check for any long-term damage.  I wish I could remember the doctor's name!  He is the reason for the 3 stars.  He was so personable and friendly the whole time and really put us both at ease.  Plus, he is a master with the sutures!    Pros - Actual medical staff are awesome. Ask for the doctor from the Philippines!  I have never had to wait more than 15 minutes and have never seen more than 2 - 5 people in the waiting room, but I could have just been lucky too.  Cons - Front desk staff at ER needs to check their attitudes.  A little customer service training goes a long way, especially for people experiencing an emergency.  ER needs some remodeling and maybe some better cleaning staff. As other reviewers have mentioned, the hospital is looking a little outdated.  I have noticed in my several trips there that this ER seems to be frequented by drug seekers.  You know, the ones who come in demanding to be seen immediately for mystery pain, then scoff at being offered Tylenol?  They are suddenly happy as pie when they are offered the "good stuff".  Not the hospital's fault, but could impact your next trip here.  Also, one of the doctors told us that Tempe PD will do a sweep of the city before big events and drop off homeless folks at the hospitals so that people don't see bums hanging around the mutli-million dollar real estate on Mill Ave.  This city definitely has two faces, but that's a subject not appropriate for Yelp.
5 The staff was super professional and friendly at all times. I felt completely welcomed and like I was family. They definitely listened to all my aches and pains. I never felt uncomfortable or weird here. This is a place to definitely come check out and get worked on. Came in broken and am leaving good as new!!  They also are very flexible in working with your schedule!!
1 My one star goes more towards the back office than the doctors. The doctors are kind of ok, you never get to see the same one though so you're always wondering who you are going to see. It goes from a doctor that prescribes you to drink more water, OJ and probiotics; to a doctor that over prescribes you antibiotics. But this isn't the main issue.  Back office: They sincerely suck! From holding on the phone for about 15-20 minutes just to make an appointment (if they don't hang up on you), or waiting for about 5 weeks to get a bill (at this point they send you a delinquent notice), or... even worse, they do not send you a bill and you get a call from collections 3 months later.   They really need to make some improvements in their billing department.  Their unfriendly staff at the front desk is not even worth mentioning.
1 Recently unemployed and uninsured I had the unfortunate circumstance of becoming ill when my appendix ruptured. As I sat in the waiting room, vomiting and crying out in pain, they took me into the dingy, dirty emergency room and say me in the hall way in a wheel chair (I was in extreme pain and vomiting my guts out. They just left me there. It just so happened that a doctor (Dr. Young) was walking by to see another patient when he spotted me. He immediately told them to take me to cat scan, may be it was the vomiting, my crying out and the pale white color I had turned that he became concerned with. Well, the cat scan showed that my appendix had burst, they ran with me to the operating room, atlas I was saved. My problem was with the hospital room they had me in (437-A) It was  filthy, I was hospitalized for a total of 5 days and not once did anyone from the housekeeping staff come in and sweep, or mop or even empty the trash. The bathroom, each time I used it I had to bring a wash cloth with me to clean off the seat (the crackhead in the next bed looked and talked shady and I wasn't taking any chances) the floor next to the floor boards in the bathroom had about an inch of black crusted dirt.....I am not kidding. When it was time for my discharge they asked me if I wanted to shower, I politely declined and told them I would shower at home (I had given myself sponge baths). My concern is, isn't infection rampant in hospitals? I can certainly see why! I hope I never have to return there for my own health. The experience was eye-opening, the crackhead next to me said that she would take my medicine if I didn't want it (she had heard me tell the nurse when I didn't want it) telling me just act like I took it, I was mortified. She ate my food if I was sleeping and constantly had her crackhead friends there, the nurse told me that she was in and out of the hospital on a weekly basis looking for pain medication. UMC did you fire your housekeeping staff? Because if I had gotten a staff infection I would have certainly sued!
5 I can offer no better review than the fact that Dr. Dedinsky has been my doctor for more than 15 years.  I highly suggest him to anyone looking for a new doctor. He is routinely listed in Phoenix magazine's "Top Docs" issue and always has surpassed my expectations.
5 Dr Alicia Myers is fantastic. She and the team are very friendly, they really take the time to understand the areas of pain or uncomfortableness. She even works on women who are pregnant. She is gentle and talks through the adjustments and makes sure you are comfortable.
5 I cannot say enough wonderful things about Aveon Health, and specifically Dr. Fereidouni. My husband and I started seeing him while he was practicing at Arrowhead Health, and loved him so much we drive from the west valley to see him at his new practice! The office is immaculate and high-tech, and with in-house lab and xray services, it is also very convienent.  The office staff is very friendly and attentive, both on the phone and in person.  Dr. Fereidouni is an amazing doctor! He truly cares about every patient, and goes above and beyond to make sure you are taken care of as a whole person, not just a condition or illness.  He is very smart, compassionate and dedicated - when you leave your appointment, all of your questions will be answered and you will know you have found a physician that genuinely cares about you. I would highly recommend Aveon Health and Dr. Fereidouni if you are looking for a family physician that treats you like.....family!
5 I've never been to physical therapy before, so I can't compare it to another experience. What I can compare it to is customer service.   I've been coming here for 3 weeks and after a joint surgery it's not what I expect. I expect to always get better and never back pedal, I'm learning that after a major surgery, frustration is part of the process. The team here is amazing in keeping my spirits up. Times I come in not feeling the best, but I always leave feeling better (inside and out). My biggest hurdle now is walking. Every visit every staff member always asks how I'm doing (everyday can change). Key is to listen to your body and voice what it's saying and they will help! I have a love hate relationship with deep tissue massages. It's definitely not what I remember them to be like. I guess when you really need it, it hurts like hell... But it's such a relief later that day.  The facility is inside of Athletic Gaines which is a sports fitness training facility. It's an open air type of feel with space for boot camps, weight training, and physical therapy. I'm always motivated to get better by being able to see others run their drills! I'm actually planning on taking some classes once I'm able to. There's sports memorabilia all around the treatment rooms; autographed footballs, basketballs and pictures; Another thing that's reassuring!!! Working with professional athletes that have rehabbed back to their profession is inspiring!   I recommend this place for those who wish to fully recover from injury. I believe healing is not just body, but mind as well, and Sports therapy is setup to win in both areas!
4 Continuum Wellness is just the right cocktail mixture of good times and hard work rolled into one to give you optimum results! I'm back to class and holding strong thanks to Steven and his team after having an ankle tendon repair from a ballet injury. Monica at the front desk couldn't be more helpful and make you feel like a long lost friend! I highly recommend Continuum Wellness for all physical therapy and sports rehab!
5 Scott is seriously the best masseuse I've ever worked with. His knowledge of sports massage and acupressure is invaluable to any athlete or active person. He has helped my chronic back pain so much. I recommend his practice to anyone dealing with repetitive sports injury, muscle pain, or just in need of a great massage.
5 During one of my daily workouts, my lower back told me to STOP doing what I was doing. Ouch! Where to go to get fixed? After some internet searching, I found Mountain Park Chiropractic and was pretty impressed with my initial visit. Clean office, super friendly staff, and professional doc. We discussed my x-rays (got these done elsewhere, as MPC does not do x-rays) and I learned that yes, I'm out of alignment and the vertebrae in my neck are not in the "normal/optimal" slightly curved shape.   My sessions begin with a couple of treatments (heat application, electrical "pulsing" stimulation--my favorite!, or ultrasound therapy) then ends with the chiropractic adjustment (generally when the chiropractor manipulates the spine and other joints by using controlled force, leverage, direction, amplitude, and velocity). Adjustments occur while lying on the fancy chiropractic table; the table is like a massage table on crack: headrest, footrests, armrests, motor that moves the table up/down. One of the oddly satisfying aspects of adjustments, at least to me, is the "popping" sound after the spine/joints are manipulated. That popping sound is the result of the joints releasing gas.  When I called to schedule my initial visit, office staff offered to call my insurance company to confirm that it covers chiropractic care. Staff then called me back to say, yes, I'm good. I really appreciated that! In addition to chiropractic care, MPC offers massage therapy. I haven't tried a massage yet, but will probably do so soon.  If you have back, neck, shoulder, etc. issues, check out MPC. They're great!
1 STAY CLEAR of this place! You have been warned. There is an rude, condescending PA there who will look at you like you are wasting her time. I went in because I was having a severe anxiety attack and my regular dr was closed. I have a 20+ year history of anxiety and at the time this was combined with depression. This overweight, blonde PA walked in like I had just bothered her on her coffee break... I was already in tears and she just stood there like "what do you want me to do?" I asked for something to relax me, as well as to be put on an antidepressant... I was treated like a pill seeking, drug addict. She really did not want to help me with anything and told me I needed to find a psychiatrist...I was then told she would write a prescription for 10 tabs of Alprozolam (Xanax) at a mg that wouldn't sedate a baby...and a referral to a psychiatrist (thanks but no thanks for your worthless referral and compassion)... I left there in tears! I wanted so bad to demand my copayment back!! Later on I went to a different urgent care PA (Expresscare) who put me on Sertaline with no problem and I am 100% better and I wasn't looked at like a nut job.   Today a client of mine told me of her horrible experience there as well and said the same PA accused her of being a pill seeker, druggie!! This place does not care about you or your illness, nor your pain. They are the prescription police and you will be judged!! Do yourself a favor and find somewhere else that actually cares about you!
3 My husband had at 1215 appointment for assessment and treatment. There's even a flyer that says "no waiting" policy. We weren't seen for 20 minutes... The therapist was very nice, professional. The reception is a different story.   There were two girls at the desk (one had just arrived to take over for the day). The first thing she said was "Ok why is this chair so high???? Omg the computer is so slow..' directed at her coworker.   Then she couldn't figure out how to bill insurance so she had to call them..that was a struggle in itself. We finally get around to payment and I ask her about billing secondary insurance. She didn't even know we had it, but we just filled out the paperwork!! Then the phone rang, and she took the call, it wasn't a quick call either. I was just left there standing and waiting!  She was just  so unprofessional, a little rude since she didn't even look in my direction, answered the phone while trying to help me, didn't know the actual address of the clinic ...  BUT the actual therapist was great.
1 Don't send your loved ones here!  People come out sicker than when they come in...or they leave in a hearse on the way to the funeral home!
5 Very easy to book an appointment, and they open for longer hours so can easily fit you in.   I came in for a 60 min massage and enjoyed every moment of it. My RMT (sorry I don't remember her name) would also check in the make sure pressure was alright, asked for areas to focus on. The room was nice and cozy and warm. =)  Really good time overall and would def head back again.
5 You know prior to arriving I was a bit concerned based on all the bad reviews. I just moved to Arizona and this is the closest hospital to where my corporate condo is.   While some of the patients are a bit sketchy - a Friday night/ Saturday morning was filled with people who were ODing - every doctor nurse intern etc were nice courteous and very very patient focused. Dr Mason is quite possibly the nicest doctor I've ever had anywhere.   Thank for such great care.
3 Das Heilbad Hoheneck, welches nicht für Schwimmsportler geeignet ist, ist vielleicht nicht DER Wellnesstempel, hat aber, durch das Solebecken unbestreitbare Qualitäten. Klar, der Altersdurchschnitt ist 55+, aber damit kann man sich arrangieren. Das Restaurant liefert leider nicht ganz die Qualität, die den Preisen enstpricht; aber man kommt ja nicht primär zum Essen her .
5 My wife started going here for therapy as the second stage of her recovery from a horrific accident several years ago.  She was in pain and very limited.  She went through therapy with Carlos and is now working with the trainer Allen.  She is doing so well I decided to start going as well!  My arthritis is better, I'm more mobile and we are both is better shape than we have been in years!  The facility and staff are great!  We both highly recommend Foothills!
5 My pain doc referred me here for PT this time and I'm glad he did.  They have put me on machines I've never been on and this is about my 4th round of PT for the same reasons.   So I am already on a positive note going in this time.  The staff are all friendly and make you feel comfortable about whatever they are working on you for.  There were a couple a very small children in there as well, and I was in awe at the patients and gentleness the staff had with them.  I'm glad my doctor switch me over to Edwin.
2 I decided to go here as a walk in patient because I have been experiencing sharp pains in my head, trouble breathing, tingling skin, etc. and the building says it an urgent care.The office was pretty clean and the wait wasn't long, about 30 minutes, and all of the staff was friendly. I do not have insurance so they charged me $60 out of pocket. I was told that any other tests would be extra and I told them that was fine.  Once I get to an exam room the doctor comes in and tells me that since I do not have insurance they can only focus on one of my symptoms. I thought this was weird because I wasn't told this before I paid and I was willing to pay for any other tests. But I stayed so we went over my symptoms and I was told that none of my symptoms were connected so I needed to go get insurance so I could get more tests run. Once we talked more she thought I could have a bladder infection so I paid $15 for a urinalysis test and was told I was fine. I walked out feeling really frustrated that I wasted time and money coming to this place and I still felt bad, I still have the sharp pains in my head as I am writing this review. I was given a prescription for an inhaler and told to take some Tylenol, which I have already been taking.   Overall, the experience wasn't bad but the whole thing just seemed like a scheme to get people's money to me. They didn't seem to really care what I was going through at all. Maybe it's better for people with insurance, I don't know. I would not recommend this place to anyone but especially those like me who do not have insurance. Go to a real urgent care or just spend the extra money to see a primary care doctor.
5 This a nice independent small shop Physical Therapy clinic. All of the therapists are well credentialed and well trained. I initially found Sport & Spine based on the recommendation of Dr. Rogerson when I was rehabing after a hip resurfacing.   I'm currently there rehabing an elbow dislocation. The therapists at Sport & Spine really seem to work with you to get you appointments in a timely manner. They also are very interested in getting you back in shape so you can meet your goals.
3 Defiantly not ok with waiting 2 hours to be seen. I was a new patient so i get needing time to do paperwork. I would have appreciated an update while sitting there is the doctor was so behind. I was told my the front desk the best appointments are in the morning around 830 or 1pm. I will remember this next time when booking an appnt as mine was at 1130. I have had a horrific time finding good doctors in NV and I saw Dr Kubal which was a blessing. I was on the verge of walking out and asking for a refund cause I waited so long. Luckily the doctor spent a good amount of time with me, refilled prescriptions needed, listened to me and overall seemed to care about my health. His nurse was friendly and caring as well. This place just may need more communication with the front and be back end and it could be top notch.
5 After years and years of back pain and recently moved to Arizona I looked for a good reputable pain facility. Yelping I found great reviews on Pain Stop N. Scottsdale and Dr. Mitch. So why not see if they were all accurate.Nothing to lose and everything to gain.  Well its only been two weeks and I must say their coordinated treatments have me feeling 90% better in only two weeks. I had not been able to sleep, my back was stiff from my neck to lower spine. I have degenerated disc and arthritis. If I don't improve anymore that would be fine since I feel like a new person already, but I expect that I will even feel better and I will continue to come here to stay pain free. No pain pills just great care. I like a place that where everyone takes there time, is pleasant, listens to you and provides great care.
5 Dr. F is great. He's patient and very attentive. A lot of doctors rush from one patient to the next and you wonder if they're even really paying attention. He seemed very knowledgable and has a good amount of experience under his belt. Highly recommended.
1 So took my fiancé here tonight as here back had been hurting her sense we got in a car accident PA wheeler green rimmed glasses gave her a muscle relaxer after asking who was in the service not only was her father a marine who has passed but myself her fiancé sitting in the same room with her am a ret. army sgt. She then proceeded to explain that the muscle relaxer has put marines on there ass joking and claiming that service members are junkies ... You have to be kidding me please honor your service men and women and choose a different location
5 This is the best chiropractic office I've ever been too. Dr. G and her staff are so amazing and friendly! They will get you in whenever you need and you still feel a connection to your doctor, you're not just a number. Thanks for the relief!
5 I love the family practice here. I have recommended Dr.Sbaih to family and friends and they love her . It's hard to find doctors here in Vegas like her
4 The place is central at University and King St. The receptionist are nice and professionals which is really appreciated. I am going there for Dr Wang who is doing acupuncture and chiro. Dr Wang is wonderful, the treatment she offered to me worked (after 6 sessions) and the insomnia I had started to disapear. Dr Wng is very nice and take time to listen and offer diverse solutions.
5 Mihaela is a healer, and she's an incredible massage therapist. I've been going to her for several years now, and she's just awesome. I've been for Swedish deep tissue massage, Reflexology, Hot Stone, and Craniosacral Therapy - she also does Thai Yoga, and Reiki. There are even sweet deals that combine multiple therapies, like the Whole Body Delight, a 2 hour treatment with 45 min Swedish deep tissue massage therapy, 30 min Reflexology, 45 min Craniosacral therapy - at $160 (2 hours!!), this is a serious deal. In fact, her rates are super reasonable across the board. All of her rates are posted online, and you can even book and confirm your appointment online - I love this! It's easy to check times and fit that much needed body work into your schedule.   I like that Mihaela's super responsive to whatever my body needs - it's not like going to a cheesy day spa where you are just going to get one ala carte style, cookie cutter massage. Mihaela really listens to your concerns, and she fixes up those sore muscles with the method that best addresses and treats your needs. She's also very intuitive - whether I feel like chatting or just peacefully zoning out, it's all good. I leave her cozy office at the Village Healing Center light, floating, soooo relaxed! Highly, highly recommended.
4 Much better than what we were expecting! Doctor checks on patients almost everyday. CNA'S promptly came to every call nicely and were helpful. Rooms were kept clean. Food was good, more variety & has an alternative if you wanted something different. Rooms were a bit outdated & small, but it was comforting to know they really do room checks every hour. However, 2 patients to a room can have its own downsides. You also may have to remind staff to turn them more often to prevent bed sores. PT & OT were good. This place was accommodating for our visiting hours before & after normal visiting hours.
1 The staff in back who provide physical therapy are professional, friendly and efficient.  I can't say the same for the front desk.  There are two gals in particular who could use some  customer service training.  I always felt when checking in as if, I was putting them out.  They never smile, greet/acknowledge you, say good morning or boo!  They were not friendly and one time it appeared two of them ganged up on one gal while correcting her in front of the waiting area about placing files.  These two women displayed poor office protocol in front of the public.  When checking out, I hated to go to any of the two front desk gals who acted like you were putting them out by having to make another appointment or take your co-pay.  Never ever said a word such as thank you, good bye or go to heil.  Get rid of the people that make a business look bad and hire staff with good customer service and want to work.
5 I started seeing Dr. Jazz when I moved to AZ about 2 years ago.  I had a regular chiropractor in So Dak and I was honestly pretty nervous about having someone else adjust me.  Dr. Jazz listened to what I had to say and put me at ease.  The office staff at Chiropractic Rehabilitation is always friendly, helpful and knowledgable.  About a year ago I was involved in a work-related accident.  I was out of touch with chiropractic care for most of that time.  I have recently started going back to Dr. Jazz and she's helping me work through some of my lingering issues from that accident.  I would highly recommend Dr. Jazz and her staff for all your chiropractic needs.
5 My name is Baron and I'm a Custom Chiropractic groupie. A last minute chiropractic appointment for a migraine brought me here and the incredible service and people keep me coming back.  Dr. Q is an amazing chiropractor and kind friend.  When I started seeing him I was having horrible tension migraines at least every week or two.  After just a month of treatment I wasn't having migraines at all.  I continue to see him because he is fun, concerned, and very talented at what he does.  I come in, tell him what's been feeling funky, and he fixes it.  Simple as that. He has come in early, late, after-hours, etc. to make sure that I'm not in pain.  The peace of mind I have from knowing how much he cares is priceless.  He is awesome. :)  I also see Carla for massage and she rocks.  I am thankful that I took a chance on Carla as she has a very soft-spoken personality and truly listens to what is going on with your body.  She checks in often on pressure and follows closely with your amount of dialogue...if you're talkative, she's talkative, if you just need some silence, she only speaks when spoken to.  She's become an all around wonderful friend.  Ashley is also a total rockstar.  If you want very deep tissue work combined with some serious stretching, she's your girl.  Like everyone at Custom, she is just a very sweet kind soul and she does her best to make sure you feel your best.        In general, the office is beautiful, located close to my work and full of the nicest people.  Shelby and Nikki, the front desk girls, are so pleasant. They're the type of gals that remember your name and do what they can do make sure you get taken care of in the best way possible.  As a former spa receptionist, I appreciate all that they do.  Actually, my first appointment happened because Shelby went out of her way to see if Dr. Q could stay late and help me with my horrible migraine.     Anyway, if it's not obvious...I am truly thankful for all the people here. Like I said, I'm a total Custom Chiropractic groupie and I think you should be too. :)  Ps. Some cherries on top are that they always have cookies and other snacks out that are delish!
5 I was just looking through different businesses that I use and was shocked to see the poor ratings for this practice. I have been with these doctors for over six years, and mostly see dr. Middleton. He's been a great doctor, takes as much time as is needed, and really takes the time to get to know my family. When I see other providers, I feel well cared for. We've never had any issues with the staff or billing.  Five stars ! I'd never go anywhere else.
5 Way To Grow has been a lifesaver for my child. When she first came to the office, she struggled with balance, holding a spoon, dressing herself, and other things. As she began therapy at Way To Grow, I saw her getting stronger and able to do things at a rapid growth. Now she is able to not only hold a spoon and pencil, she is writing, and can dress herself, and use playground equipment with ease. It could not have been done without the therapists at Way To Grow. The entire staff is very friendly, very sweet, understanding and so knowledgeable in their field. Highly recommend.
5 I have been seeing Alper for three years now, and he is the best RMT I have ever worked with. Due to career related pain, I've seen many RMTs, physio therapists, and acupuncturists over the years and Alper is definitely one of the best I ever got to work with. Not only he is knowledgeable in what he does, he really invests in his clients so that what he does can be incooprate into daily lives. Compare to where I was with the level of pain and discomfort and where I am now, I can honestly say he has changed my life for good!!
4 I have been seeing the naturopath, chiropractor and massage therapist and my family doctor is there too. They are very pleasant, professional and knowledgeable. They try to explain everything until you understand what the problem is and how to fix it.  I have seen different doctors in the past and even paid more money and not seen results. But at this clinic I have had great results so far, I have been improving in everything that I've been working on.  The last thing I am going to work on with them is my knee issue. If they can fix that, I will update this review and give them 5 stars.
5 In massive pain all weekend. Called them first thing Monday Morning and they got me right in. After Dr Blankenbaker worked on me I left there feeling great. Great service and staff. I will use them again.
1 Worst care I've ever seen.  My husband waited an average of 1 1/2 hours every time he asked for a pain pill.  The nurses were the slowest, laziest people I've ever seen.  The doctor who runs the place doesn't know what he's doing.  After two weeks I forced them to discharge my husband.  Except for emptying the garbage, the room hardly ever gets cleaned.  The food is so bad I spent a small fortune bringing food in every day for my husband to eat.  He sent back just about every meal that he was served.  If you complain about the care they start having an attitude toward you.  Stay far, far away from this place.
1 STAY AWAY - I saw Dr Trainer for an issue for my hand. I waited 2 1/2 hours in the waiting room and the office. The Doc then saw me for 2 minutes tops and told me I needed to see a a surgeon. They provided me with a referral that was "in" network. That was not accurate. I called the office and waited 45 minutes on hold and navigated the various options on the phone system and then finally got someone so that I could get a new referral. They then transferred me to someone that literally had a 5 minute voice mail greeting and then I left a message?!   I have invested 3 hours and 20 minutes to see this doctor for 2 minutes.
5 I was in pain after a long trip.  I was worked in the day I called.  After our consult I was adjusted the same day to relieve my pain.   My job schedule is crazy and they are very accommodating. I highly recommend for their flexible hours and good care.
1 This office has good reviews and I don't know why. I saw the male Dr here, Dr Noel. My new patient appointment lasted about 3 minutes after waiting 2 hours past my appointment time in a tiny, hot, very full waiting room, and consisted of him cutting me off and not letting me talk. He looked at the meds I take and said they were too high and needed to be changed even though he's never seen me before and has never run any lab work. They then billed me for multiple types of new patient office visits that totaled $510.00 for my 3 minute appointment, and never reported the $50.00 I had to pay in office before seeing the Dr to my insurance company (even though I have no co-pay on my insurance). Then charged me a no-show fee for a follow up appointment that was cancelled the day after it was booked. Dr Francesca seems to have some good reviews but I would not recommend this office overall, lots of medical assistants working but they all seem a little lost, overcharging, and expect to wait way beyond your appointment time.
1 This business did not respond to email or voicemail messages.  A groupon was bought for the business and impossible to make a booking.  So cancelled and got a refund.  I would not advise anyone to seek services from this business especially after I did my own due diligence!.  Update on Sep 26, 2016: Brent did call me this morning and was highly apologetic.  He was professional and I can chalk it down to a new business inundated with tasks, calls and more. I would be inclined to give him a chance after a lengthy conversation.
1 Rude receptionist and condescending, too concerned with getting you off the phone instead of listening to your request.
4 First time ever getting a massage from elements and absolutely loved my massage lady! Will come back
1 Kindred Flamingo has the best physical therapy department. Janet, Todd, Bryan, Kristen, Pam, Ross and the rest of the crew changed my life   Other areas of the facility are on the poor side. They have some great nurses aides but there given many patients and working two separate halls which disables them from helping each patient.   Several of the nurses speak Pilipino  on the floor which is unprofessional but very common   I rang for help for morning meds from 8:30 till 11:20  one morning and then went and asked Fannie the charge nurse who was my nurse she just ignores me   That is common in this facility. I found out I was not placed on any of the nurses paperwork as a patient to administer  my meds for thus day    Fannie never apologized not do I believe we're there any ramifications for her very unprofessional actions.   Management wants to blame there staff but let's face it, your staff is a direct reflection of your management skills
4 Came in with no appointment on a Monday afternoon. I was seen in about 10 minutes with no problems. The staff was very friendly and the wait was very short once I was in the room. Very clean and I will definitely skip the urgent care and go here. Very convenient hours and I was happy to see they are open on weekends as well.
5 It was a very pleasant experience with Silvana and her husband JC,I didn't know what to expect,But there so friendly and make you feel very comfortable from the minute you walk in until the end of your session,I will definitely be a repeat customer
5 Staff is fantastic. Prices are super reasonable. Went in with an injury that had troubled me for months and was able to see positive improvements hours after my treatment.
5 This clinic is very friendly and knowledgable and multiple injuries and therapy options for each individual's needs. After one week I already feel stronger and barely have any pain in my hip. Gotta stay with therapy and it will have results!
4 We all know how hard it is to find a good doctor. I have had some really, really awful experiences in this city, and this place finally ended my year long search for a decent doctor. I have been seeing Dr. Kalra, and she is absolutely fantastic. She spent more than 60 seconds with me, which is 30 seconds longer than any other doctor I have seen in this city.   As for the facility itself, it is clean and the staff are very welcoming. Wait times vary; I am usually called back within 10 minutes of my appointment. Everyone I interacted with was efficient and knowledgable. When my doctor suggested that I have bloodwork done, I was able to have it done in a room just down the hall from where I spoke with my doctor, and the technician was a miracle worker for this needle-phobe!
1 This has been my primary for over two years. What a disappointment that I am writing this review. I used to love this place! My old PA was caring, kind and considerate. WELL THATS OUT THE WINDOW !  Tammy Collinder.. what a crock. Avoid this lady at all costs. It was my second experience with her and a TERRIBLE one at that. The worst one of my adult life in fact. I booked a psychical and a Pap smear. I came down with a terrible cold and had severe ear pain and asked her to look at it. She gave me a choice of getting my pap or having her look at my ears but she wouldn't do both. When I asked for a refill of my prescription, she refused that and told me it would be a minimum of 3 visits just to get my medication REFILL for panic attacks. "To make sure I wasn't abusing them". First off, one prescription lasts me a year. They have that record. So then, after I agree to the pap she tells me .. GET THIS!!! She won't be doing a breast exam. "That's no longer recommended" and she wouldn't be able to even show me how to do a self exam. Meanwhile, my wife saw a dr two days prior and he did a breast exam and found a lump. Thank God! So.. I guess if someone under her care develops breast cancer, too bad for you.. she won't be examining that at all. I left in a state of shock. I went from positive experiences with the staff (the girls up front are great) having a caring and patient dr to having someone tell me "I've already wasted so much time explaining this to you, and I only have so much time for this appointment. " wow. Karma is a real bitch lady, good luck.
5 Der gute erste Eindruck am Telefon hat sich voll bestätigt. Das Centrum für Physiotherapie Steffen Baldi ist super organisiert, es kam nie zu Wartezeiten. Das Personal ist sehr sympathisch, freundlich und kompetent. Ich habe mich in dem Ambiente wohlgefühlt und kam mir so gar nicht wie ein Patient vor. Und das Wichtigste, mir ging's ruckzuck wieder gut. Uneingeschränkt zu empfehlen!
5 In choosing a physical therapy clinic, I had many choices within a short driving distance. After hearing great things about Tim Soder's clinics, I found that his Henderson clinic is only 12 miles from my home. All along my intent was to try it out the first time and then decide between another one even closer to home. Prior to treatment I visited the clinic to fill out paperwork and test the driving distance. Already, I became apprehensive about the driving time. I hit traffic and the 12 mile drive took 25 minutes. Factor in the round trip plus the time spent in treatment and it started to seem out of hand for my tight schedule. When I drove there for my first scheduled appointment, I decided to just come right out and let them know it wasn't going to work for me. The way Calvin and the staff handled me convinced me to stay. I received quality attention and care from educated professionals. Rob has certification in "dry needling" known to reactivate dormant muscles. Therapeutic massage, corrective stretches, specific exercise and professional attention made the drive worthwhile.
1 This place is horrible. I waited an hour and a half after my appointment. My doctor prescribed me the incorrect meds. I tried for 3 weeks to get them fixed. I called, left messages, waited forever on hold. They said they would correct the problem, but did not. Then I just waited on hold but I work so I had to just give up. One night I almost ended up in the ER, so I called their after hours and they doctor there said they didn't know the answer to my questions and couldn't help me. Another time when I did get an answer, they didn't know what to prescribe me! And now, I got the bill and it's not due for awhile but I'm constantly getting called and harrassed for the payment as if I am overdue and never pay my medical bills. I have perfect credit, my bill is not even DUE but they call rudely demanding I pay on the spot. What the heck? This is the wost experience I ever had. And, I had to give up and go find another doctor to get the help I needed because this facility was so horrible I couldn't continue with them.
5 This review has been a long time coming as I've been familiar w/ Gabrielle 4 over 15 yrs now (back from when her loc8ion used 2 b @ the 15th Ave/Camelback). U won't find a more compassion8 professional 4 ur female annual checkups, testing, delic8 procedures, family planning (or lack there~of if ur on/needing birth control).     She's very understanding, non~judgmental, goes over all options/risks 2 assist u making an informed decision & possesses a rarely found bed~side manner 2 put u @ ease.       My family member is a high~risk pregnancy expecting twins w/ a lot of complic8ed factors that require significant monitoring, but she couldn't b in better hands 4 her expected new additions!!  So 4 any females seeking a good 'gyno',~ (I know, sensitive/uncomfortable subject) she's ur woman!  It's evident she truly cares about her p8ients, making it as comfortable as it gets 4 paps, stirrups &  these kind of visits 4 check~ups & women's healthcare needs... u won't b sorry being in her very capable hands!
1 Worst service ever. I changed my PCP over to this clinic because they are very close to my house and they always seemed empty so I figured I could get an appointment quickly. I was able to get an appointment right away (same day I called actually) with a physician's assistant. While the PA was fine, he seemed to be competent- the administrative staff were complete morons. Giggling, loud talking, complaining about their job- all while customers sat in the lobby. After being sent to get X-Rays, I was surprised to never get a follow up call. Well, more than a month after I took the x-ray's I get a letter in the mail that they have been unable to reach me via phone. I call them, I wait on hold for OVER 30 minutes and then speak to another genius (sarcasm) who has great difficulty updating my phone number in the system. This place may be close, but their ineptitude doesn't make going here convenient. Terrible. Terrible. Terrible. Absolutely terrible.
2 Agree with all of the reviews posted that state that Southeast Valley is not the same as it was before Banner took it over.  What a big mistake.  Impossible to get a message to Dr. Bray's medical assistant now.  Left a message with some triage person on Tuesday and did not hear back until 5pm--closing time on Thursday.  Need to find a new family practitioner for my husband and I.
5 I'm a big fan of this gym. It's big and it has a lot of different equipment. My personal trainer Irene is awesome! This EOS has a pool, sauna and spa. They have a ton of classes to choose from too. It's a 24hour gym with childcare that goes until 9pm. I use the child care a lot and it's great u
5 I started out at Relevations for Pilates.  I was thrilled to find a downtown Pilates studio - it is a brand new, well appointed studio with excellent teachers.  Both Jen and David put a lot of time and effort into planning their classes, and get to know their students so they can customize each class.  Other studios I have been to will cancel classes if there is not a minimum number of participants.  Relevations always runs their classes as long as 1 person signs up so I have ended up in many 'group' classes that have ended up being private classes.  It is an amazing benefit you won't find many other places, especially if you try to keep your workouts on a schedule.    Over time I have expanded to TRX classes, which have been a fun way to mix up the routine.  Each class is different, with many days having theme music which makes the classes more fun and pass by faster.  I never intended on doing physical therapy, but after having classes with Jen I mentioned a nagging shoulder problem.  She worked on an injury that happened 12 years ago and made significant improvements in it - all well explaining what was going on, how she was improving it, and what I needed to do at home.  I never thought of PT as an option for it, and I'm so glad she mentioned it!
5 My boyfriend does not have a yelp account but he wanted me to write this review.   "I love this place, my shin is all better now. The treatment is phenomenal. The service is out of this world. I would never go ANYWHERE else. Scott and his staff are the best. "
2 Many years ago I had to come here because of hand injury I suffered as a result of work. I was driven here by our hotel's security officer and waited a long time in the front, before being directed back to the many waiting rooms in the back. I can hear people, I presume doctors, picking up and looking at the clipboard with the paperwork I filled out when I was admitted.  At least 3 times the clipboard was put back and someone walked to the next room to check the next clipboards.  After awhile I heard another male staff/doctor picking up the clipboard and reading the forms and commenting he doesn't know about hand injuries.    So yeah, after waiting much too long, longer than the 1.5 hours the front office staff was estimating and hearing disparaging remark like that, I started to resent my visit and thought this place must only hired the bottom of the barrel "doctors" on the cheaps.    I am sure they are great with treating patients with visible traumas, you know, the compound fractures, cuts, gun shots, stab wounds, and probably that poor guy with the pitchfork accident (what you have not seen that photo floating around Facebook and the Internet in general???).  But God forbid if it is an internal injury that requires more in depth medical knowledge or effort to diagnosed. Carpal tunnel - that guy obviously have never heard of it.  Just take muscle relaxants and pain killers, and you are good to go back to work. Next!  (1 star!!! Since that's the lowest possible)  That was a few years ago. Now I suffered a back strain or sprain, as diagnosed by ER doctor that didn't even see me, but the PAC probably filled him in on my situation, plus the description of the injury on the many forms I filled out.  The estimated wait time is 2.5 hours. I spent roughly 50 minutes in the lobby waiting. Then I was escorted to one of the exam rooms, had my vitals measured by a Student Extern right away and waited for a doctor. Since the initial medical diagnosis was already performed, there was luckily none of that checking the clipboard to cherry pick the easiest cases available. But it still took 38 minutes for a doctor to finally check on me, with sporadic Student Externs checking to see if I needed water or tea and to let them know if I needed anything. Nice touch, but the goal is still to be in and out in the shortest possible time possible, while still getting the proper care and correct medical diagnosis possible.  Since I have nothing except my completed C-4 form from the hospital, another set of X-Ray was ordered. That process was completed quickly and efficiently by a radiologist that was pregnant, so she wasn't in the physical capacity to help me on and off the table for the X-Rays to be taken, so the Student Extern from earlier was called to assist me, which I'm grateful for.  By now exactly an hour has past since being sent back to wait in the exam room.  After another brief wait time for the X-Rays to be processed and evaluated, the doctor handling my case completed his evaluation and recommendation, gave me pain relief gel, a hot & cold gel pack for me to use at home, and I was escorted next door to their Physical Therapy office.  Time elapsed thus far: 2.5 hours. Damn, they are good at estimating how much time it will take.  Another 10 minutes for the PT referral, follow-up appointment to be set and paperwork for myself and employers and I was discharged.  Completely different experience this time around. I felt like I was treated with care, and the only major thing that can improve is just the overall time waiting to be processed and total time I was in Concentra.  (3.5 stars)  So hopefully, the trend of improving the perception and reality of medical care given will continue. It is a real challenge, and something that the entire US Health Care system is in serious need of addressing.  Anyway, averaging out my two visits, but will update in the future, but hopefully I will not have a need to be back.
5 Dr. David Lee is the go-to chiropractor for me! I have had back issue for years. Instead of keeping on giving me adjustments endlessly, David actually explained to me the problems and showed me where I need to strength my muscles, so that my body naturally maintain good posture. When you have back pain, the issue is not with your bone necessarily, it has to do with the tissues and muscles that support the bones, so correcting bone alignment won't solve the problem, because your bones will just get misalignment again with out proper support from tissues and muscles. Anyways,  David would explain it in much better terms, I'm not doing it justice.
1 My appointment at 13.30. Arrived at 13.25 and was nobody else in the waiting room but me alone. Jenna and the other female staff in pink was there. Just such unproffesional staff they were just  talking and kept me waiting for 45 minutes, till finally I heard they talked each other decided whom would handle me. And the pink lady started to take care for me and she even didnt call my name but just keep staring on the chart and that´s it I told her that´s must be me. Just such disrespect and unproffesional that the staff kept me waiting so long from my appointment time and even had no clue to read my name at least a try.
5 This was my first day of Pilates and I thought it was fantastic! The entire Pilates staff was very helpful and even as a newbie to the  Pilates world.... treated me great! Michelle and Mark were great and love my class!
5 So far I have nothing but praise for this practice and the staff. Being new to the area, I thought it would be tough to find a new doctor for myself and family. But, Southern Nevada Internal Medicine / Pediatrics, has proven that sentiment wrong. From the first interaction with the staff, and them fitting my daughter in on very short notice even though we were not established patients was phenomenal. the were super nice and very willing to work with us. I called this practice due to the reviews here on yelp about Dr.George, I am sure he is a great doctor, but he was booked that day and we had to see Dr. Parker. After this one visit with Dr. Parker we are ready to make him our primary physician. We were very impressed with his personality and demeanor and he was great with our kids. I mainly am writing this review to tell you that even if you cannot get in to see Dr. George, you should still make this your practice. From the staff to the doctors it is top notch!
4 I heard of Elements on Shea through Arizona Spa Girls a while ago but had never been there before. When I was in dire need of a massage last night (around 4:30pm), I decided to call and see if they had any openings at all. When I called they were incredibly professional and kind and were able to fit both me and my boyfriend in for appointments at 7pm. So convenient and helpful!  We arrived a few minutes early to fill out some first-timer paperwork, and were very impressed immediately by the cleanliness and tranquility of this beautiful little shop. We both received 55-min. massages at the introductory $59 rate and were more than relaxed when we left. Definitely one of the best massages I've had in a while!   We'll definitely be back again soon!
1 This used to be a good facility for primary care physicians and nurse practitioners over the eight years that I've been coming here until about last year when there started to be nothing but problems. Recently they've canceled an appointment on me even after they told me to come in, they told me they we're going to put in an order for labs which luckily I decided to verify because it turned out the nurse practitioner that I saw never put in the order, they were supposed to send my medical records to specialists and request records to be returned from specialists that were never sent and they scheduled me to come in for shots two weeks before they actually had to be done which was a complete waste of time. Dumb!
5 I just had my ACL done just over 4 weeks ago and I will say Dr. Freedberg is amazing.  What I enjoyed about him, is that he talks real talk, meaning he tell you exactly what to expect and explains everything so you understand what is going to happen.  He treated me with respect, caring and made me feel comfortable with the procedure.  Kathy his side nurse was truly caring and made sure to answer all my questions.  I wouldn't hesitate to refer anyone to see Dr. Freedberg.
1 Started off good. Met with Dr Zuing, them with Tom every time after that. Until he quit. Then I met with some clown named Pam. No professionalism at all. She said she'd fax my prescription in. I said I prefer hard copy n that I always been given hard copy. She said she already put it into my pharmacy. I went there later. Nothing. I call the office, no one can help. Now I'm leaving town for a week and needed it filled. They said they'd call another office. What? No one available to call in my prescription at 3pm?!?  I needed it and it was they're fault for screwing it up. Demanded to talk to a supervisor. And got hung up on. I called back and asked again, hung up on when told to hold please. I got thru and I told the woman-who wouldn't even give me her name!-how rude n unprofessional the whole situation was and she tells me I'm being rude! Are you for real?  Then they send ME a letter saying they're refusing me service and to find another dr. Look I know they deal with a lot of addicts. But I hate taking anything, and everyone knows that. But I am older, wiser and more polite then all your staff and the least you could of done was apologize when you screwed up and make amends. It's what adults do. I think they take too much of their own drugs they're prescribing. Cause they are DELUSIONAL there. Dr Z hire tom back and ask him about me. Calm cool n collected. Hope you clean house and then give me a call. Until then I will see a more professional n courteous dr office. Do not go there!!
5 I sprained my ankle at the end of August while working and I've had many visits here for workers comp. My first visit without an appointment was 4 hours long on a weekday mid-morning, which appears to be the busiest time.  Every follow up since has varied from being here for a total of less than an hour to being here over 2 hours with an appointment. But the staff tries to get everyone taken care of and sent on their way.     Dr. Tony Chin is my favorite to see, since he is the new main physician here and genuinely cares about the care his patients receive. He said he's only been here for about 7 months and is doing his best to give Concentra a good name. I was afraid to come here since my co-workers have been at Concentra before for drug testing and injuries.  I also received several sessions of physical therapy and the waiting there is minimal, under 5 minutes every time. Physical Therapist Greg was caring and showed interest in my recovery, and his staff is very helpful.  I have encountered many friendly staff members that show compassion here, but also a couple that probably shouldn't be in the medical field.   Over all, I highly recommend this Concentra on Polaris. I know that I'll be treated with compassion and care if I ever have to come back.
5 My wife and I are senior citizens and have recently moved to Arizona. We've both been going to a chiropractor for quite a few years but we have "NEVER" had such complete pain free relief as we are experiencing since we started going to to Ryno Family Chiropractic. It's truly had a positive impact on our lives.
5 My wife has been in and out of this place for the last 4 months....the best thing about this hospital are the nurses.....the fifth floor nurses rock...they are so knowlegable and always take extra time to make sure she is comfortable. The rooms are clean and spacious.....Tameka rocks!!!!!!!
1 This place is Dangerous! A year ago my step dad was admitted after cancer surgery, for a few weeks to build up strength.  He developed wounds on the back of his heels, because they didn't care for him properly. Those wounds stopped him from getting Chemotherapy!! 8 months later, he ends up back in Palm Valley, trust us we had NO CHOICES!!  He leaves there and is transferred to a  hospital. The hospital tells us he has multiple infections! There were infections in his feeding tube, his medication port, etc. (and of course the original wounds of his heels!) When he was transferred they lied and said he had no infections!!) They also lost all his clothes, PJ's, Slippers, etc. Everything we brought down for him and had been transferred there with him.  They take no responsibility for anything they do!! My step dad died a few days ago, his death and the horrible circumstances were totally made worse, and brought on years sooner because of the disastrous treatment he received at Palm Valley!!
5 Ron is awesome! Under his guidance, I overcame an injury that plagued my running for over a year. After working with Ron as a PT/coach for just a few months, I ran a 10k in 40:49, which is a PR, and a half marathon in 1:30.52, which is right on my PR. These results are huge for me! I used to think that my fastest days were behind me, but I no longer believe that at all.   When I first contacted Ron, I had been battling a hip/back injury for over a year. This injury caused me to limp (literally) the last four miles of a half marathon. Afterward, I couldn't run more than five miles without significant discomfort, and I had a dull ache in my lower back that was constantly present in my daily life. This went on for months.  I tried all the usual things: Ice, foam roller, stretching, a chiropractor, and diagnosing myself on WebMD. None of this worked. I finally broke down and asked my PCP for a referral to a physical therapist. However, when I went in for my appointment, the physical therapist told me flat-out that there wasn't anything he could do to help me because I was "already pretty fit."   After some Googling, I came across Maximum Velocity Physical Therapy. I was intrigued because Ron describes himself as running/triathlon focused, which is EXACTLY what I wanted. I sent him kind of a crazy, desperate email, and he replied back within hours. My immediate impression was that I'd be in good hands with Ron, and that impression turned out to be 100% correct.  During my first appointment, Ron identified several weaknesses that he thought were contributing to my injury. He prescribed some strengthening exercises and told me that I'd be running pain-free in no time. Frankly, I did not believe him. How could I overcome a year-long injury so quickly? But it turns out he was right. After several weeks of working with Ron, I was able to run long and hard again. And equally amazing--that dull ache in my back finally went away. Thank goodness!   Several attributes set Ron apart from other physical therapists I have encountered: He is relentlessly positive, has a passion for educating his clients/athletes, and genuinely cares. Plus, he knows how to work with runners and triathletes, which is a rare find. These attributes also happen to make him a great coach. I had a fantastic time working with Ron during my last training cycle, and I'm looking forward to working him in the future. This is not a decision I take lightly; I'm very serious about my training and racing, so it's a big deal to have a coach I trust.  In short: Ron has my highest recommendation. Go see him if you have a stubborn injury, and go see him if you want to get faster!
5 I have tried so many different clinics and Tara was the only RMT able to make a difference in the pain that I have. Tara took the time to do an assessment and provide me with a tailored treatment that helped make me feel better. She also gave me exercises and stretches to do at home. She's easily now my go-to RMT.
3 Ich war auch schon mehrfach hier. Allerdings heißt die Sauna inzwischen Ruhepuls-Sauna. Der Eintrittspreis ist mit EUR 14,00 nicht ganz niedrig, allerding ist das Ambiente wirklich schön. Es wird so argumentiert, dass es ja ein Tagespreis wäre. Es gibt allerdings auch noch einen Abendtarif ab 19:30 bis 22:00 Uhr, der ist niedriger. Weniger schön ist, dass am Frauensaunatag die Blockhaussauna grundsätzlich erst ab 14:00 Uhr eingeheizt wird, geöffnet ist die Sauna aber ab 08:00 Uhr. Dafür darf frau dann trotzdem den gesamten Preis bezahlen!! Bei Beschwerden darüber wird man an den Chef verwiesen, dem solle man eben schreiben. Anwesend scheint er nicht zu sein. Informiert wurde er über meine Beschwerde offenbar nicht. Sonst hätte er sich ja vielleicht an mich gewandt. Drei Sterne gibt es dennoch: für die Freundlichkeit der Mitarbeiterinnen und das Ambiente. Die mangelhafte Kundenorientierung muss ich leider mit zwei Sterne Abzug quittieren. Denn wenn ich eine Außensauna angekündigt bekomme, dann erwarte ich, dass diese auch eingeheizt wird. Es waren keine technischen Probleme die Begründung, sondern einfach Vorgabe vom Chef!  Und auf der Homepage steht auch nicht, dass diese Sauna erst ab 14:00 Uhr eingeheizt wird.
1 Horrible. Terrible. If you want pain relief stick your head in a blender. Thats far better advise then dr. k. They dont know and they dont care . dr k compassionate? my foot. she stinks if you real want pain relief go to a dr that liostens and understands and has experience
5 I had the best possible experience with Dr Adamany. I was referred by Dr for carpal tunnel syndrome. I'm so happy I had it done. My results are fantastic. I'm able to work painfree, sleep with out waking up numb and can enjoy cooking and creating with annoying numbness and pain! I'm so happy! The entire staff is very nice and compassionate. I had no issues at all and in fact just referred my mother to them
5 I saw Dr. Eric for my trap/shoulder issue that I've had for years now and within the hour my mobility was greatly improved and it feels much more relaxed/less tense. The amount of attention he gave to the issue was greatly appreciated.  Dr. Eric finds the root of the issue and doesn't just cover it up and I could tell he truly cares about making sure I left better off than I was when I came in. Highly recommended!
4 My whole family has been seeing Dr. Laufer for several years!!!!!  It is always a good visit I wish they took AHCCCS as well. :)
1 Worst ever!!! Made appointment for covered wellness exam...they scheduled tests not covered by my insurance... $900.00 later, worst place ever!
1 I have gone here for the last several years. Every year at this time of year I get reoccurring sinus infections.. every year for the past 9 years. Hello!!!! I went in today and saw the same PA I have seen over the past few years, have always liked him.  But, today this practice has lost yet another patient. Because I was in there 2 months ago and last month with the same problem and was in there today stating the same symptoms, dizziness, headache, and pain in my forehead. This PA walks in and says "so your are here for your monthly doctors note" WTF and proceeded to tell me that "this is a medical clinic and you come in here trying to jerk us around" and "you can't possibly be sick again this soon" and "this is abuse of medical care" then says I do have "water behind my ear drum and do have drainage in the back of my throat" which I had 2 months ago which he attempted to treat, a month later I was still not feeling well, same symptoms, which again he attempted to treat. So, what happened this time, are you that frustrated that you are not able to figure out what is wrong with me or that you have to work on Saturdays? Or maybe someone pissed in your wheaties? But don't take you nasty attitude out on your patients!!! Who in the hell to you think you are?  He was rude and disrespectful and did not even do what he said he was going to do. Gave me no medical help in any way and I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS PRACTICE.  Last year I was almost put in the hospital because my symptoms kept coming back, Did you bother to look any further back than 2 months? Then you would see I have issues at this time of the year. What is wrong with you? Is it to much to much to ask that you do your job that I am paying you for, then maybe I would not have to keep coming back with the same damn symptoms?
1 I went in a few weeks ago to get some scripts.  The one medication they gave me did not clear up my issue (only half way).  I called to get a refill and they wanted me to come back in.  Seriously?  To tell me what I already know!  So i'm supposed to take an hr out of my day and $$$$ for the doctor to sit with me for 2 min to say yup your still sick.  Here's a refill.  And when I looked up how effective the medication was it said that I would have to do several weeks of the medication when the doctor only prescribed a week.  This place is scam.
1 They don't respect your time at all .. that all I can say for now and especially Dr. Williams Vaughn very poor time management. no customer service and humanity at all. save you time and money and find someone more helpful and care. ..
5 Dr. Campbell and the entire office have been professional, prompt, and have provided excellent customer service to me after my car accident. They value your time and that is so important when balancing work, appointments and physical therapy.
5 Ive been to a few places before and haven't really found the treatment I needed. This RMT can really feel all your knotted spots. He asked me about my occupation and based on that info he was able to understand the way I use my body and treat the muscles that were tense. There were spots I didn't even know were tight until he found them. Theres definitely an improvement and I feel like I can move so much better. After the treatment I was given some stretches I can try at home to prevent the pain from coming back. Not only did I get a wonderful massage, but I also learned a lot about my body. Would definitely recommend!
5 Jacky was very professional and makes me feel very confident about recovering by giving me as much information as possible.   Tip: they help you process claims onsite so you don't need to do any paper work yourself!
5 I have had back pain for the last 20 years & been to many physical therapy practices.I decided to try Don Nobis Physical Therapy & thank god I did. The results from treatment have changed my life for the better & made it possible to continue to run my business. Don & his staff are amazing,they truly care about you!
5 I am so sad when I have to miss my weekly appointments! I LOVE going to Pain Stop Arrowhead! They are the best! The staff is unbelievably nice and they make the pain go away!
1 the WORST experience EVER!!!  i rush to get to my appt ON TIME and i'm waiting and waiting in his office to be seen.  i see him walk by with a drug rep. with NO acknowledgement of "just a minute" or "i'm running a little late"....then i wait longer and he finally comes in the room and NOT even an apology,  i have an attitude and he acknowledges it.  i tell him i do not appreciate waiting while he is with a drug rep.  i was the first appt after lunch...waiting a half hour is unacceptable.  he informs me that he is my pcp..i said NO...i was given an appt with you.  i said i will see another doctor (many doctors in this practice).  he said "no you will not see any doctors in this practice".  front desk girl said i CAN see another doctor.  TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE BEDSIDE MANOR...MY RECOMMENDATION FOR THIS DOCTOR IS TO RETIRE!
5 I utilized treatment here for several years until recently venturing elsewhere.  As the old saying goes, if it isn't broken, don't fix it.  This is the place to go in the Gilbert/East Valley region.  Dr. Wasserman has established a vibrant business and it continues to flourish.  From my perspective, this is due to both excellent service and staffing.  Dr. Krahl is a very attentive practicioner, who listens to her patient's concerns and provides effective treatment.  The support staff is large enought to ensure you are attended to both before and after each treatment segment.  You won't have to figure out how to extract yourself from a decompression harness because the bell rang ten minutes ago and you've become an afterthought.  Plus, if I forget to schedule a maintenance visit they will either give me a call or send me a reminder that I am probably due for a therapy session.  Dr. Wasserman's practice has grown from a small strip mall office to half of a medical building, and has now expanded to the entire building.  That is proof of a sound practice.  When you can grow in a down economy, it means that you are providing a valuable service at a price that represents value.
5 'Toronto's Urban Angel' truly sets itself as a leader in quality health care. Located in downtown Toronto, St. Michael's was formerly a Catholic-owned hospital turned public hospital offering preventive and emergency care to residents and visitors alike. Unlike many urban hospitals that I've visited before, visits to the ER at St. Michael's couldn't be more easier. Instead of waiting 9-10 hours at private U.S. hospitals (done that in the past), you are checked in and attended in a timely manner, ensuring you won't be spending hours waiting patiently to see a doctor.  The hospital is home to many speciality doctors that you can see if the ER recommends that you see a physician for continuing care. While it can be a wait to see a doctor due to their schedules, the care and guidance provided during a private visit is worth the wait.  The only negative aspect that I received during my first visit to St. Mike's was with the billing department as I had not been in the province for the required 90 days before I qualified for OHIP, and therefore my private insurance took a while to pay the hospital. I had to reassure them that payment was on the way, but it was a nuisance to get statements in the mail every week. Note to billing: "Patience is a Virtue."   Highly recommended if you're in Toronto's downtown core area and require immediate care!
4 I am new to the west valley and overall this doctors office meets my expectations.  I am surprised to see that they accept "walk-in appointments". Once care is established getting into see the doctor does not involve a long wait. The patient rooms are clean and up to the modern age for technology.  I went to see Dr. Martin for my annual check up and she is great. I was pleased with a high level of patient care from her. Also, she is conscious of what costs are beneficial for her patients (like generic drugs v.s. outrageous name brands).  As far as follow up from staff I have not really had an issue. I did call once and I did not get a call back (I was sick and on a cancellation list). I  did call back and was scheduled and seen in a prompt and professional manner. This was after establishing care and getting into the system.   So in conclusion, if you want a decent no bull medical office go here. If you just walk in expect a wait.  If you want to have some kind of hand held small town experience go elsewhere.
5 Went to Irina for the first time. She is great. Well worth it. Was very interested in all over health. I found it best to contact her by email for an appointment. She is well worth trying. I am sure I will return when I want another massage.
4 Enduring a dental exam and x-rays is not on my list of fun things to do when I'm in Las Vegas. Whether it's normal human phobia over having someone poke my mouth with sharp metal instruments, the fear of the drill, or the recurring (and true) nightmare about the Long Island dentist who left me with permanent trouble spots, I never look forward to dental visits.   However, Wonderful Smiles Dental is well on the way to changing my bad attitude.  Why?  They're on the ball. Dr. Johnston actually read my medical history before she inspected my teeth, and realized  one of my medications might put me at risk for infection. She called my doctor to check it out, and they devised a plan to keep me safe.   The staff is friendly and the system is efficient. After my first visit, which included the exam and X-rays, I left with a printed treatment estimate that included my costs, copays, and instructions. And, appointments were easy to schedule.   For the most part, there was no up selling. One hygienist was a bit over-zealous in her attempts to wrangle my gums into submission. She pushed for a deep cleaning, then a water pik, then more on the deep cleaning, until I realized I was holding the chair with a death grip and counting the seconds until I could escape.  She meant well, but I prefer a more gentle approach.   Patients have the option of watching a nice quality flat screen tv during treatment.  The practice is clean and comfortably furnished, although as a large size patient I'd like to see a couple of armless chairs in the waiting room.   Overall, I'm impressed, and I'm almost looking forward to returning next month to have a few tiny cavities filled by Dr. Johnston.
5 About two weeks ago I was rear-ended by a truck. I have never been in a car accident before. Initially it was a big shock, for two days I had a constant headache. For me headaches are extremely rare so I knew something was not right considering my upper back and neck were in pain as well.   I was referred to American Chiropractic and I am so happy I decided to go to them. I have never met a team of people who are so kind and personable! I knew initially from my first phone call that I was in good hands.   My first visit I was a tad nervous being that I have never been to a chiropractor before but they really put me at ease. After x-rays and examination, my pains were proven by their findings and they set up a treatment plan for me. I will now be visiting a few times a week until February to get all back to "normal".  Being that I wasn't expecting to be in a car accident (who really is) such a long treatment plan kind of sucks for me. Had I been scheduled to visit weekly to an office with staff who are less than desirable the process would be miserable. I feel so lucky that I wound up here and I have a good feeling my visits will fly by.   The staff is incredibly friendly and professional. They work with you side by side at each day and treat you as more than just another patient. I usually show up 15 mins early for my appointments and they take me right back. They are quick and very knowledgeable. The office is also updated and clean which I appreciate.   I would definitely recommend them to anyone!!!
4 I have been a patient for a little under 1 year now due to employer insurance change in coverage. I had to find a new primary care physician and found Tempe Family Practice through our network. I called to schedule an appointment for my annual woman exam and they immediately discovered that there were other issues going on with me although my results from my exam came back perfect. I have had my procedure done through a specialist Dr. Alia referred me to and feel great!  Also, within the past 4 weeks my daughter had an incident during a basketball game at school and we had to get her into the emergency room. Per their direction we were to see our primary care after a week, but when I called in to schedule that appointment, they suggested that we get her in within the day due to my daughter's constant headache's. During our visit, Dr. Alia was very attentive and showed genuine concern for her even though this was his first time seeing her. He then referred us out to a Pediatric Neurologist and we are currently under her care and direction, but Dr. Alia is still involved. During these few weeks Dr. Alia has taken the time to call me personally to check on my daughter to ensure that she is making positive progress and to see if we have any unanswered questions. How often does that happen? I love it...  In all of my years going to different doctor's I have never had a Doc take the time to call him/herself. I have also referred a friend to him and they were also able to diagnose what had previously been misdiagnosed by another doctor and get her back in tip top shape. I will continue to come to Dr. Alia and Tempe Family practice and encourage you to do the same.  Keep in mind, the office is not brand new with all the fancy new furniture in the lobby, but I would much rather have better care and a proper diagnosis than go somewhere that's pretty.
5 I choose my doctor because we have the same first & last name. I figure my doc had to be cool!!  Dr. Kim Olson-Gibbs is amazing. She is both genuine & sincere, will spend time with you to address all your concerns, and is beyond thorough!  I can talk with her about any and everything. She is by far, the best doc I've ever seen and I trust her completely.
1 What a waste of time and money!!  I'm not sure if all the Dr.s are the same, but the one I saw spent 10 minutes with me & didn't even want to bother looking at medical records & reports I brought with me.  If I could give a zero or even minus star I would.  Upset and anger is all I got out of this visit!  Apparently this is not an uncommon complaint which is really sad.  I've since seen a FABULOUS back Dr who knows how to treat patients and spend more than 10 minutes with you.
5 I've been here several times & I am always prepared to wait a minimum of 1 hour to be seen, its a UMC walk-in facility, what do you expect? You didn't make an appointment to be seen and they take patients in order of priority due to their age/severity of illness.  The front desk staff & nurses are always very friendly/welcoming. I do admit the nurses to tend to chat a lot in the back, but overall they get the job done.  All the prescriptions & diagnosis from the doctors are spot on for me. From strep throat, tonsilitous,  to allergies; I always go to this UMC and I have not have any problems.
5 Staff is great and Buddy the therapy dog is awesome! Have gone here many, many times with great results always!
1 I wish I can give this place no Stars .  It was so easy to sign up for my membership, Due to my health I had no choice other than cancelling my membership, this was back in March , it is now 9/17/2015, EOS is still charging my account. The managers are incompetent. They are honestly a Joke, as far as the 1800 number they have no control over the transactions. This is Illegal! I have proof I cancelled my account and yet they still charge my bank every month. Please don't go here.
5 Dr Josh is amazing! I was able to be fit in on the same day! I wobbled in and walked out! The staff, from the front desk to any of the assistants are top notch!   Dr Josh and Dr Dabbah work together to provide care that will really help patients without the multiple never ending  visits!   You cannot be in better hands!
1 Front desk staff here is very unprofessional. They're very loud in stating information to patients on other side of desk. I heard them refusing to take patients because of co pay but it was embarrassing to some people to be hearing patients information. One receptionist was making fun of a patient when they left saying was that person a he/she a shim a man woman? Very unprofessional and the wait times are crazy! I would never come back here.
5 All my respect to Drs. Matt & Dom for replacing the two dislocated ribs I incurred from Jim & Tom at The Joint Chiropractic, Camelback location in September.  Dr. Matt is amazing, thorough, makes sure you understand exactly what's wrong and how to fix it.  The front office girls are fantastic, warm & friendly.  They do take x-rays and thank GOD for that!  They also have on site massage.  I will NEVER let another Chiropractor treat me.  Thank you so much.
5 I have been a patient here for a few years, on and off, when needed. I have Dr. D. Sackett as my PCP and only have had appts with her or Nurse Practitioner, Janelle. I have not had any problems with either one and my interactions with staff and reception has been pleasant.  I mainly have had routine checkups for HBP, but when I did have a more serious health situation they were great in listening to me, following checkups, and medication needs.  I had stopped going for awhile, maybe a year not good with time, but was due to losing job and no health insurance. Yes, even under Obamacare I don't have insurance. Well, I needed to start up my HBP meds again since I could tell I was not doing good. I was hoping for a refills to just be given but they needed to see me, which was understandable. I was up front with NOT having insurance, but if I was given out-of-pocket costs up front I could determine payment. They had no problem working with me still, was up front with visit costs and was back on my meds. Even directed me to a place to get my blood tests run at a very reasonable cost. Good thing they followed up with me because found that my meds weren't working like before and had to add on another med that made things better.  I see the negative reviews for the other Dr. but I have never met/seen this doctor and only dealt with female doctor and NP. I recommended this place and Dr. to my sister and she has had all good experiences with them. I would just say give them a chance and determine for yourself. You can always change your mind and go somewhere else.
1 Dr Christy is very nice and sweet...but I tried to tell her several times that I'm breaking out really bad and getting worse. Then after 3 more appointments it had spread to my back with deep cystic acne. I have spend hundreds at the dermatologist and the dermatologist said it's the testosterone trying to escape my body thats causing it. It's now been 2 months since i weened off my hormone meds and my body is still releasing the testosterone. I'm very fit and muscular and already produce test naturally. My case is different from others and my body isn't reacting "by the book." I've switched to my family car physician for now to monitor things until I decide what direction I want to go.  Update: In November 2016 I was diagnosed with Gastroparesis with which is a paralyzed stomach. This results in not getting the nutrients that I need which causes low blood sugar issues as well as many others. All of the symptoms correlated with feeling as if I had hormonal in balances. My Dr did several tests on my hormones & found that they were all exactly right in the middle of the normal range. After not being on hormones for months and my hormones tested completely normal this makes me believe that I was lied to with Vitality's test results just so they could treat me. It just doesn't add up. My skin got worse while being treated by Vitality, from too much testosterone exiting the body (my dermatologist & Dr said that's what happened), then got off meds and tested normal. Hmmmm
5 So far after my first appointment, I feel very confident physical therapy from this place will be beneficial. The man knows about MS and is extremely knowledgeable.  I am not easily impressed but they impressed me! And they promised they would never laugh at me if I fall, unlike at the places I've been to before. So that reassured me.
5 Dr. Mitchell combines adjustments with massage and physical therapy.  If you're looking for a chiropractor that knows his stuff, you found him!
2 Horrible experience. I went in to get checked out for an ear infection. Staff was friendly and the place was clean but here is my issue: The PA prescribed to me an antibiotic and ear drops at the CVS right down the street. I walked over to CVS and there was no record of a prescription under my name. No biggie. After waiting 20 minutes with no luck I decided to give the office a call to see what was the hold up with them putting in my prescription. The receptionist said that she would send it over right away. I waited 30 more minutes and still no prescription!  This time I decided to walk back to the office and the woman at the front desk called it in for me, I was a little annoyed but just happy that it was getting taken care of. Boy was I wrong! When I got back to CVS, they had my antibiotics but no ear drops! So I called the office once again, this time I was on hold for 15 minutes and finally got through to someone. The receptionist said that she had to check with the PA regarding my ear drops and that they would get back to me. An hour later and still no word from their office. Even the pharmacist recommended that I find a new practitioner. I will not be going back!
5 I cannot praise Rob and his staff to much. Without exception, they were knowledgeable, helpful, and above all, caring. Almost worth getting injured again to be able to come back.
5 This is a great place to take Pilates Reformer classes.  I have some physical limitations, and Shelley is a highly trained physical therapist and also an expert in doing Pilates with correct form, so that her clients get the maximum benefit from exercise without injury.  She knows how help her clients improve posture, flexibility, and strength. She is warm, caring, and encouraging.  Her studio has a lovely and relaxing atmosphere.  I highly recommend Sage Pilates and Wellness.
4 Dr. Butler is professional -- here's what you can expect: Suppose your appointment is for 10:30. You arrive at 10:25 to an empty waiting room -- not a room crammed with sniffling, coughing sick people. THANK YOU!   At 10:28 his nurse takes you in; weighs you, takes your vital signs and very shortly, Dr. Butler comes in and reviews the results of the blood tests you did earlier that week. He asks if you have any concerns, illnesses, etc. "Nope -- just here for a check-up." Fine.   They do an EKG, a breathing test, a chest X-ray, a hearing test and urinalysis. In other words -- everything a doctor needs to know to see if you're okay -- no hidden diseases, no vitamin deficiencies, etc.   The first time I went to Dr. Butler it was because someone I worked with was tired of hearing my constand cough -- turned out to be acid reflux. Easily fixed. One other time I had bronchitis -- Dr. Butler gave me a prescription for antibiotics and said, "if this hasn't cleared up in 10 days, come back." He is NOT into building a big practice, running up your bill or soaking your insurance company. Again, Thank you!   If you're looking for Marcus Welby, M.D., who is going to ask about your family, your vacation, your dog, you do not want to go to Dr. Butler. But if you want someone who is professional, punctual and will respect your time, then Dr. Butler is for you.
5 I give this company 5 stars for sure! The staff is so friendly and makes you feel very comfortable! Highly recommend!
5 My family has come to this clinic for 2 generations. We knew after Dr Dorway left that we'd be in good hands with Dr Naiman. Lucky for us we have Dr Santos too! We couldn't be more pleased that we have a choice between 2 of Las  Vegas's finest. Thank you, Dr's, for your continued care!
5 Pay less and more professional b/c the emphasis is on teaching future professionals
1 Please please please get back to the level of service you guys had prior to joining the Banner Group. I HATE not being able to leave the medical assistant a quick voicemail or easily follow up on a procedure/test results. The scheduling process is not user friendly like it used to be (BRING BACK WILLOW!), and getting a response from the office for easy things like lab results requires an act of Congress it seems.
5 Had a microdermabrasion and a chemical peel done through a groupon purchase. Very professional and clean environment. Would love to go back but over my budget without the groupon :(
1 Avoid this place at all cost. They don't care about patients that are in severe and chronic pain.
1 Extremely unprofessional service. Have called THREE times to get in to see a doctor I used to see and have never received a return phone call. Talk about bad bad business practice. AWFUL.
2 Dr. Vogel is a good salesman.  Not sure why he chose to be a chiropractor. His patient' well being is certainly not his priority. It is a production line system. You will be overcharged. Definitely check Amazon before you buy anything from them.  He will tell you that your care will be covered once your insurance runs out. This is not true. I was given a phone call an hour before my appointment to tell me I would now be charged considerably high rates. My plan of care changed when my 4k deductible ran out. Suddenly I needed only 2 days of treatment, not 4. This was not discussed with me.  Again, great sales technique but very little medical benefit.
1 Wanted unnecessary blood work (EVERY MONTH!), why when I'm taking ZERO medication as they trying to "fix" the problem through herbal supplements 5 appointments and 4 months later nothing different...SCAM!!  Went to another doctor and I was back to normal after my 2nd visit!  Not to mention after my insurance paid what was allowed, I was billed the remainder!  I would not recommend to anyone!
4 I have gone to dozens of urgent care/labs etc for vaccines, drug tests, as I am a contractor and need various tests for each job. Everyone is friendly, the place is clean, and despite at times the lobby being ridiculously full I am seen in a timely manner. I can't speak to the place as an actually urgent care, but as an outpatient testing and medical center, they're great.
1 I also want to mention Dr. Hal thought he was a psychologist and was treating my husband for PTSD!!  I met with him and said please stop you are not a licensed psychologist and the drugs you are prescribing are messing him up.  He didn't listen, this man and his assistant are a joke!!!!!
5 Ryan is fantastic! He tailors your treatments  to your personal needs, unlike other physical therapists I've been to that gave the same program to all their patients regardless of their injury. Ryan is attentive, thorough and listens to all of your concerns. Because of his treatment, I am now physically able to do what I love again.
5 Arizona Physical Therapy Specialists (AZPTS) is 'Best In Class' and rivaled by few if any outpatient clinics in this country.  Several things set AZPTS apart from standard clinics both locally and nationally but two in particular deserve highlighting.  First is the commitment AZPTS has made that doctors of physical therapy will provide all patient care.  By not delegating any portion of care to assistants, the doctor of physical therapy remains in control of every clinical decision ensuring continuity and optimal outcomes.    Second is the level of training and expertise the clinicians at AZPTS have obtained.  Founder/owner Dr. Tim Fearon is widely recognized as the mentor or mentors for orthopedic manual physical therapists.  Practicing clinicians from all across the country including myself take leave of our clinics to spend time with Tim so that our skills may be taken to the next level.    As a candidate for fellowship in the American Academy of Orthopaedic Manual Physical Therapists I also had the privilege to be instructed by Dr. Mark Kargela on several occasions.  Most recently I spent a full week at AZPTS and witnessed first-hand the exceptional level of care he offers his patients.  Mark is one of very few clinicians I have come into contact with who is fluent across all dimensions of evidence based physical therapy interventions.  While most therapists tend to rely on one or two skills, Mark's proficiency in such a wide range of approaches allows him to deliver the most effective therapy regardless of the issue at hand.    Mark and the rest of the team at AZPTS are shining examples of how effective and transformative modern day physical therapy can be and they have my absolute highest recommendation.
1 Don't even consider taking your loved one to this facility. If I could rate them at "ZERO" I would. We put my dad there for rehab after a three week hospital stay for Sepsis and CHF. After three days he was rushed back to the hospital because he had gained 35 pounds of fluid retention weight. They "forgot" to weigh him every day, and he had a urinary restriction. The ER emptied 2725 CCs from his bladder! We were lucky it didn't rupture. A normal bladder holds about 500 CCs. So after another 3 weeks in the hospital, and not knowing any better, we went back to Heartland. For about a week and a half, he seemed to be doing OK losing more fluid weight  on the diuretics they were giving him, but then they AND the doctor on call there failed to recognize the symptoms of dehydration (and we didn't know them) until he was terribly dehydrated. They notified us by phone at 9 AM that they were going to start an IV and he should be fine.  We got there with my also elderly mom 4 hours later and found him slumped in his chair, NO IV STARTED, and nearly unconscious. They said they tried three times to start the IV and couldn't, but they weren't DOING anything. Again, rushed back to the hospital at our insistence where they determined his sodium level to be 170 (144 is normal, 160 is dangerously high). Essentially, they nearly killed him. Result, three more weeks in the hospital. Needless to say we didn't go back there for rehab.  Do yourselves a favor.  Research nursing and rehab homes through Medicare's web site. Had I done that at the start rather than listening to the Heartland rep at the hospital, I would have seen Heartland rated "Much Below Average" for nursing homes in the area. By looking at the reviews on the Medicare site, we found a much better place in the area, highly rated, and dad's doing great there.
5 Amazing service. So glad I was helped by such caring and patient people! I was somewhat frustrated however with the people in the front and the somewhat occasional rude glares, especially with the lady at the front desk with her own section/desk before you walk in to the workout room,  but putting that aside and focusing on the service with the real hands on help, 10/10!!! I could not have gone with a better physical therapist!
5 Dr. Hogan knows what he is doing. His is like hidden gem down there in E Flamingo. Would recommend to everybody who has problems with their spine, or neck like I had 10 years after traffic accident.
5 LOVE DR.O  She totally is a phenomenal doctor! She has respected my choice in trying things naturally with vitamins and or therapies as I would like but also takes her time with her patients and reviews all ur concerns.
5 Been seeing Dr Willden for 3 years now. I e never had a doc actually take his time to talk to you about issues and give you pointers on what you can do to help your quality of life.
5 Dr Rachel might be the best family doctor in Vegas. Many good advices, taking her time with me and my wife, remembers your medical history . She's really caring about her job.  The staff is kind and polite.  One of the big pluses is the waiting time, never had more than 15-20 minutes in here. One of the best small medical cabinets in Vegas.  Thank you guys!
5 My stay at palm Valley was Home away from Home. Food was GREAT, my Social worker Anna was helpful, Therapy got me ready for my next surgery, and All the staff was so nice. I want to thank Alyssa my nurse. Alyssa has a heart of gold. The staff they have at Palm Valley make you smile and feel welcome when your struggling. I will recommend anyone to bring family here.
5 If anyone has shoulder problem or needs rotater cuff surgery or replacement the best doctor is Dr. Lederman. He has so much experience and is very well respected in his field. I had a complete tear and he did a great job.
1 Hope you have a lot of time to wait. After you sign in, you'll wait around 45 minutes to an hour, but people who come in after you will get in faster you'll notice. Just watched two people who came in long after me be in and out of here seeing the same Doctor I'm scheduled to see. This doctor better be worth this long wait. Sitting here for an hour so far. So if you do choose to visit this smelly ass place, then you better block out lots of extra time for waiting.
1 This is the worst doctor I have ever been to. Dr. Linda was absolutely terrible. I just moved here so had to change doctors. I have IBS, and came in, previously I've had a billion tests. She just tried to convince me I was pregnant the whole time. For one I am celibate, but she refused to listen to me, and forced me to take a pregnancy test, which was demeaning. She didn't listen to me that I already had certain tests done, and was going to put me through what I had already been through AGAIN. Besides that, it is impossible to get appointments here, unless you want to see her....And she has no people skills. I left this office very upset,
2 My husband and I went there for our anniversary on Monday.  He had booked us for a couple's massage.  We got there about 45 minutes early (11:45ish) so we could register and spend some time in the jacuzzi as requested.  We waited in the reception area for about 10 minutes without seeing anyone.  I finally went looking for someone and found the woman pictured on the website buzzing around the solarium.  She told me to go back and wait in the reception area ... so we did for another 10 or minutes until she came to us.  The water in the jacuzzi was hot but nice once we got used to it.  The leather chaises are comfy.  Tea and cold drinking water are available ... but they ran out of water :(  The tub in the couple's massage room is basically a long tub.  The water was really really HOT and we had to add lots of cold water to make it bearable.  The tub wasn't wide enough for us to sit side by side so we ended up end to end (so his feet were towards me as were mine to him).  Not exactly romantic.  There were pastries left for us next to the tub which was odd ... who wants to eat a pecan tart sitting in a tub?  The couple's tub at the Stillwater is much nicer ... it's round and roomy, is a jacuzzi (so has bubbles) and has lights built into it for light therapy.    Mary and Christina gave good basic massages.  Usually when you have an RMT massage, though, you get your receipt on the spot.  With Shizen, we were told they would be mailed to us ... huh?  Should be interesting to see the names of the massage therapists match the ones on the receipts.  Though there are about 10 lockers in it, the women's change room is really only conducive for one person as there is only one shower, one bathroom stall and one sink.  So if you are there with a group, you'll have to wait your turn to clean up.  The frosted glass in the door is weird ... you have to go to the far end of the room to change or you can be seen naked by any guys coming out of the men's change room.  Chocolate covered strawberries were supposed to be in the couple's room (as part of the couple's massage package) but arrived about ten minutes after we were showered and ready to go.  So we sat in the solarium waiting for them and then ate them there.  They were tasty.  With all the spas in the city, I wouldn't go back.  The Elmwood and Stillwater are much nicer and professional.  UPDATE:  It took a week and a half to get our RMT receipts.
3 Friendly staff but very slow service. I waited over an hour just to get a review of my lab test??? Dr. Kimberly is great though..they just need to improve their service time.
5 Great facility, very nice and knowledgeable staff.  Really helped me strengthen my knee.  I'd highly recommend them to anyone.
1 Dignity Health has the worst scheduling department!  I had a pre-op visit scheduled and was on my way to my appointment and scheduling called to tell me that I could not see this doctor because he hadn't seen me before. My PCP had retired so I needed to get in quickly for some routine pre-op lab work.  I had already mentioned to scheduling that I had not seen this doctor but all of my previous records were in the system.  Today my husband scheduled an appointment with one of the doctors.  He took off of work and when he got there he was told that doctor was not even in on Mondays!!  They suggested that he go to the emergency room if he needed care. Apparently it was the 2nd time today that it happened. Sometimes it takes weeks or even months to see your PCP.  I don't care how good the doctors are within Dignity, we will be taking our business elsewhere from now on.
3 Can someone explain to me why their wait time is approximately 2 hours, when they're obviously not busy?  The three stars is only because the triage nurses (Mika and Edelyn) and doctor were friendly. Thankfully, I was able to be seen in 30 minutes from when I checked in. I was treated for my burn and it was all good. After that, I had to wait for my paperwork. I wasnt sure where to wait.... I had to ask three times, one at another desk. My paperwork was finished at 1:00pm, and apparently they called my name. At 1:30, I asked again and was finally handed the paperwork. I dont know why they couldn't have called out my name again..? I basically sat and waited for my paperwork that's already been finished. I feel the reception desk doesn't  put much effort into customer service.
4 All of the GPs I've seen her have been great and listen very well. I've seen Dr. Houseman and Dr. MacLeod and they are both attentive and patient. It was easy to get registered here and they always have appointments available when I need then, even the same day. Wait times are typically manageable. Really happy my local surgery is great!
1 The most unprofessional, unorganized and rude office staff I have ever dealt with. when I wanted to speak with Dr. Forte to let her know the behaviour of her staff, I was told she was on vacation as was the office manager, so apparently the office and everything else is being run by unprofessional, young women who believe that they are irreplaceable in an economy where jobs are hard to find. Dear staff, there are tons of people that would love to have a chance to have a job where all they have to do is answer the phones and treat people with respect. That is your job that Dr Forte is paying you for! Taking it for granted in this climate isn't the wisest thing, especially when people do have a choice to go to another doctor. May be Dr Forte does not care about her patiants or losing business because of this, but I am sure there is another, better doctor out there that would love to treat good paying patience that need help. One Doctors "trash" is another Doctor's treasure??  I would never recommend this doctor to anyone. This is my last appointment, and only because I respect Dr. Lyons and want to wish him well before dumping this practice.
5 Came in 7/30/2016 and was promptly greeted. Was back in exam room in under 5 minutes. Nurse came in for preliminary checks (patient history, bp, o2 sat rates, symptoms) Dr. Chrystal Taylor, P.A. came in within a couple minutes, properly and promptly came up with diagnosis, Upper respiratory infection. Wrote scripts, asked if I had any questions and I was back out the door in under 30 minutes. Have been to other Urgent Care places and always had great service. This site was amazing. I would not hesitate to go here again. MANY, MANY THANKS! Dave D.
5 This was a pretty cool experience. There is no traditional receptionist, and instead a few Ipads you sign in with which prompts a real person to come give you forms. Your name then shows up on the big screen TV estimating a time. An automated voice then calls your name and directs you to the room.. very futuristic. I actually prefer the efficiency of this system rather than lining up and dealing with a grumpy receptionist. As for the doctor's visit, Dr. Andrew Chou was amazeballz! This was an initial consultation, yet he took his time to really get to know my situation and provided a lot of information specific to my needs. What I also appreciated was that he was very knowledgeable and caring about mental health issues, and was able to recommend alternatives to medicine, like smoking cessation and stress reduction programs.  Very satisfied with my new progressive clinic and doctor :)
1 disclaimer: this is a review about the membership process only, not the facility itself.  i bought a groupon for a trial membership.  it was required that i have a consultation with the gym before i could begin using the membership i already paid for.   went in for my "consultation".  the standard, "what are your fitness goals?", "what are you hoping to achieve by...", "do you have health insurance?", etc. i HATE this.  look, i get it, it's sales.  but this is not my first rodeo and i don't need to launch into a completely irrelevant and manipulatively elicited diatribe about my feelings on fitness, my body image issues, or what i hope to accomplish whilst there. and yes, there are some people who do and who want to.  but know your audience, wynn fitness!   my insurance benefits are none of your business.  if i want to see a chiropractor, nutritionist, dietitian, RMT, or any other paramedical practitioner, i'll let you know, thank you very much.  and if i do, i can assure you he or she won't be employed by a practice within a fitness club that exists solely to latch onto the teats of naive and unsuspecting gym members who don't understand a gym's business model. and shame on wynn fitness for promoting and probably receiving a cut from this method of generating leads and "growing a practice".   no, i don't want to provide my email address. or the name of my employer.  what does this have to do with me working out?  no, i don't want to be weighed. or assessed.  no, i don't want a "free" session with a trainer.  why--so i can endure another awkward sales pitch to purchase personal training packages?  and you know what, they don't even ask you.  it's just implied. it's a "bonus" that comes with your membership! you don't have to endure these hoops people! your body, your membership, your money. anyway, i digress...  no, i don't want to purchase a year long membership before my first visit.  (this is why i purchased a trial.)  not even if there's a special promotion.  a special promotion that is ending in like...what are the odds--tomorrow.  there's a promotion every day.  every. single. day.  it should come as no surprise then that i was so put off by the aggressive, gratuitous pitch that i never even wound up using the trial membership.    to be fair, this is not a wynn specific issue.  sadly, it's the nature of the fitness club industry.  the only way to not participate in the pressure is to decline and rock the boat. and who wants to start a new relationship, one you're paying for, with this label?  lastly, when you go to wynn's site, you can read the reviews.  strange that all 25 reviews posted are amazing reviews (out of 5 possible, 22 five-star & 3 four-star ratings). if wynn was confident in the service they provide, there'd be no need to filter their members' sentiments.
5 Today I came in to get blood work done for a work related incident. I have seen Dr. Waltman previously for a physical exam and it's always a good experience when I visit. Christine, Ivan and Abeni are great and very friendly. My visits never last more than 20 minutes and I never wait more than 5 minutes to be taken back from the lobby, you can't beat that compared to most medical offices around! Getting my blood drawn always makes me nervous so I want to give a huge shout out to Ivan! He was very gentle and was finished getting my blood before I knew it! Thank you Canyon Pointe Healthcare!!
1 This quite possibly might be the worst Hospital on the face of the planet the doctor named Chris Hinson is a seriously unethical torturous human being who enjoys seeing people suffer. This Hospital has mistreated me more than once and I have filed several complaints I recommend that if you only have 5 minutes to live take the 10-minute drive to another hospital you have better odds. I definitely don't think giving birth here they are rude unsanitary and unbelievably belittling. After filing several complaints I found that nothing has been done and that dr. Chris Henson is still free to continue malpractice. Screw this Hospital for all it's worth. I'm surprised there's not a higher death rate at ASU because this Hospital sure as hell wouldn't be able to save anyone their doctors are ridiculous and their staff even worse
1 3 hour wait for a physical. They only had 1 doctor working. I would recommend a better urgent care, Concentra has no problem making people wait and no customer service. If you are sick I would go elsewhere because you will be waiting a very long time if you come here.
1 The worst day of my life was here. My dad fell and scraped his arm and he didn't know it but he actually hit his head very hard. They fixed his arm and sent him home. They said they would have a specialist call him in because there was some bruising on his head. The specialist didn't call and my dad had a seizure at home. He went back in and they realized he was bleeding in his brain. By the time they realized this, it was too late. He passed away. From something that could have been helped. They waited too long and sent him home. They also put him in a regular room and we're going to send him home AGAIN after he had a seizure. The doctor took almost a day and a half to see him and realize it was an emergency. They gave him blood pressure pills which put him to sleep and never woke up. When the nurses were explaining this to me they were so relaxed and we're laughing a couple minutes before telling me my dad was brain dead. I have never felt so disrespected and mistreated. If you can help it, please go somewhere else.
5 Dr. Santos is great. He has been my daughters pediatrician for almost 2 years now. We moved to South Summerlin, but still make the longer drive because Dr. Santos is so wonderful with her. He's friendly and knows his stuff.
4 Although other reviewers seem to indicate a pattern of problems with this facility, I've had nothing but professional experiences with the office staff, and Dr. Lillo and his team deserve at least five stars. Dr. Lillo and his staff have been quick to respond, they explain things clearly, and they are compassionate. The front desk staff occasionally seem harried, but they have always been quite polite.
5 Dr Parikh is very smart, keeps up to date and understands the art of medicine - an excellent Dr.
1 I came here as it was listed on Kaiser website as an accepted location. I called before going and explained about my 6 years old most probably have a fracture. They didn't inform me on phone that this location is only accepted location for Kaiser Hawaii and not Kaiser California. They didn't inform me that they don't have basic fracture related supplies for kids like even a sling.  We have paid out of pocket, waited for 3 hours. We were not given icepack or some kind of support to keep arm comfortable during the wait. Finally when doctor saw us and took an X-ray, broken bone was confirmed. They tried to wrap my kid's shoulder using a elastic bandage roll. Nurses were really confused how to do it and hurt my kid in the process. They made a huge knot on her back. While we were wondering on the impracticality of this wrap my daughter was crying in pain. Doctor asked nurses to take it off and told us basically we don't need to do anything it will heal by itself. We came out without a sling or support for the arm, just an X-ray and a prescription of child size shoulder support which was not available in any pharmacy in Las Vegas. They didn't give us any useful information about where to buy it. They just took our money and sent us back in the same shape we came in. Only more hurt because of botched attempt on making a makeshift clavicle wrap. If anything they should make a makeshift sling. I learned that when I called my doctor next day. When I put a sling on my 6 years old next day she felt immediately comfortable and remarked, 'Why did doctor not think of it?'. This doctor didn't even mention sling. I can't believe we spent a whole day without sling probably making it worse. We carried her in and carried her out as it hurt with every step. Save yourself trouble and go to hospital in case of emergency.
4 Pain can tend to clarify your priorities. When you find that you are living with pain every day, it begins to make sense to find someone to help you get rid of it. Unfortunately, it seems, a lot of the techniques used to get rid of pain, are even more painful.  One hot summer day, as Dad tends to the grill, and my extended family enjoy the pool in the backyard. I playfully splashed my aunt, who then began to chase me around the yard. As I ran through the patio, I failed to see the post, when CRACK - I broke my right wrist in two places.  A few years later, I find myself in Korea, going through leadership training with the US Army. During the critical land navigation course, I began to run along a fence, much to fast to see the support wire which catches me in the chin, knocking me out instantly. I sail through the air before landing on a rock when CRACK - I broke my neck.  Fast forward, too many years to mention, as the nerves in my right arm begin to suffer the effects of my old wrist and neck injuries. The pain is mild at first, but foolishly, I decided to begin a rigorous weight training program which increased the pain progressively until I decided to get some help.  The Physical Therapists and Occupational Therapists at Select used combinations of exercise, stretching, massage, heat and cold to address my injuries. At every point in my therapy, they explained what they were doing, what I should be doing, and how all of this was going to help me.  You may be apprehensive about going to any Physical or Occupational Therapy, but trust me when I say that this is a team you can trust.
5 Excellent therapists and staff.  After three years of using a walker I was able to ambulate with a cane following six weeks of PT with this talented team.
5 Dr Webber and staff are great to work with, they helped me rehab my injuries and were very professional. Thanks for getting me back to normal after such a traumatic experience.
1 I made an appointment to see Dr. Messer and spent over 90 minutes waiting before she saw me.  She never acknowledged or apologized for the delay.  My second appointment was at 4:30, when I arrived they told me that I was mistaken and it was actually at 4 and they couldn't see me because I was late.  I explained that I was told that the appointment was for 4:30 and that I never received a confirmation call with a different time and asked if they could fit me in.  They told me that the clinic policy stated that they would not see patients that arrived late, which I don't believe I was for they messed up with the appointment time.  I feel that they see everyone as a business transaction and expect flexibility on the behalf of the patient but don't extend the same flexibility or respect towards the patient.
5 My wife and I needed a new Family Physician and were so fortunate to have found Dr. Mike. He is clear and courteous, doesn't speak down to you and leaves you feeling well informed and confident about treatment.  His staff is top notch, professional and very efficient.   Lab work and radiological tests are done on premises which is so convenient, especially when the technician escorts you,  should need to go to another office on another floor, for them to do the imaging, etc.   Also, our experience is, that you are seen on time, which is incredible.  No more sitting around for hours in a waiting room.
5 My Husband has been a patient here for decades.. I started coming here about three years ago and last year moved my kiddos here from their Pediatrician. It's easier to have us all at the same Dr office. The check in staff are fantastic! What I disliked about coming here, was you never see an actually Doctor. Or if you want to, you have to wait MONTHS. I was completely bummed because it seems like they go through a ton of Nurse Practitioners. I would meet one I liked, next time, she'd be gone. The reason I'm writing this is because I was lucky enough to come in on Ms. Joan Cacciola's first day as a Nurse Practitioner at Dr. Onefrei's office. I can't say enough about this wonderful woman. I haven't had any faith in medical staff for years. I always felt like no one took the time to listen to me. Or investigate why I was feeling like I was, or to follow up to make sure I was doing good. Nurse Joanie (as my four year old calls her) is AMAZING! She thoroughly checks you, takes the time to explain EVERYTHING. Answer all your questions. And if by a rare chance she doesn't know off the top of her head, she investigates and actually gets back in touch with you! Her bedside manner with both my husband and I as well as our 4yo daughter and 15 yo son is top notch. If she leaves this Doctor's office (I hope not!) we will definitely be tracking her down and following her! This is what healthcare professionals used to be like! And it makes me so at ease to know there are very few gems like Joanie still out there today. If you're looking for an amazing Practitioner, call here, ask to see Joanie. Well worth it! Incredibly intelligent, caring, honest woman!
5 I've been a patient here for five years and have had nothing but good experiences. My doctor is Dr. O'Leary and his nurse is Michelle. They couldn't be nicer or more professional. I've never had a problem being seen or getting a prescription refill called in to my pharmacy. I've never had to wait long to be seen and I'm treated like a partner in my care.  i'm frankly shocked by the bad reviews.  I'm a retired nurse so I've known a few doctors and medical practices in my time.  Please don't be put off by these negative reviews.
5 Needed help with allergic reaction. The staff was fast and courteous. Was feeling better before I left. Saved me an er visit. The PAs are fantastic.
5 I absolutely love my Dr. Sbaih. I've been her patient for 3 years now. It's hard finding a good doctor in Vegas. My parents recommended her to me. She genuinely cares, she attentively listens, and honestly.....I feel so comfortable with her it's like having coffee with a friend. Oh! Did I mention.... she's drop dead gorgeous! She's a family practitioner, offers a great diet program, and I get my Botox there too. Her staff is always nice, and on top of things. If you need a good doctor?  I highly recommend her.
5 This place is amazing. It's about half the price of other companies but the same great quality of care. Dino is my favorite massage therapist because he is passionate about what he does and he is great at deep tissue massage. Korla is also wonderful and helped me a lot with my pain. I have always been able to get in for an appointment around my work schedule as they are very accommodating. Highly recommended!!!
3 Been here a few times, our foster daughter broke her finger. So, have been to three follow ups. The medical staff are very nice, and helpful. The administration staff however is an issue. Every time we are there they are asking us questions they should already know, all you have to do is bring up her file! We have to fill out the same paperwork every time. This place is huge, a lot of traffic. But is served its purpose.
5 I went to her as a recommendation from my friend.  Now I know why my friend loves her so much!  Dr Sobaih is the most caring physician.  She genuinely took concern with me.  I lost 8 inches in my waist line with her help.  I've referred several who all love her too.  Her staff is amazing too.
3 Horrible!  Do not take kids there!  They have no clue how to deal with kids.  Doctors have 0 bed side manner and the entire staff are unfriendly.  They must make money off of tests because they just start running all these tests for things that dont make sense...without even asking if you agree.   It seems like a place more interested in making money than treating patients.  They even told me they dont have the flu rapid response test because they cant bill for it.  Editing my review. They have had turnover for the better!  I ended up having to go back there & glad I gave it another shot.
5 Great doctor!! Except most insurances.  Walk-ins are welcome. They are open Monday through Friday from 8 AM to 4:30 PM.
5 I feel this practice deserves a better rating than the current 3.5, so I am contributing it to hope justify this office.  Most complains are about the wait times... but lots of Dr. offices in Vegas make you wait forever.  The popular ones are usually with a long wait and some doctors are worth waiting for, I believe.  Hate to say this, but do you feel comfortable going to see a doctor with no one in line, doesn't that make you wonder why he/she is unpopular?  And things do happen with doctors, some cases are easy and some are not, so they can't always justify their appointment times, especially he's also a pediatrician.  You know how parents can be.  I am not saying that everyone should always wait for an hour to be seen, but I do understand why doctors are usually late for their appointments.    For my first visit, I waited for 75 mins before Dr George came in to my exam room.  I was about to be very furious and almost walked out just a few minutes before he came in, but after he spent 25 minutes with me in the room asking and listening to all of my problems and issues, I honestly didn't mind the initial long wait.  It shows that the Dr. does care or listen to your needs or concerns.  It's worse when you wait for the dr. for 1 hour and you only see him for 2 minutes.  Not the case with Dr. George.  Every visit I've had with him, he always took the time to listen and explain, I never felt like I was asking too many questions and being rushed so he could move on.  I like they have a lab on site, so that saves you time to go to another lab place to get basic tests done.  And the rest of my visits are usually a 30-min wait, just the first time was bad and he did explain why.   Also love that you can email him with questions and he always writes back or his staff would call you back within 24 hours.  They'd help me make appointments with specialists on my behalf, so I can be seen sooner, and they always checked which specialist I could go base on my insurance.  I love the email system of him writing back personally or he would make sure his staff take care of his patients.  Twice, I got emergency appointments to see his staff the very next day or same day.  One time I got to see his practice partner, Dr. Ryon, who is also beyond helpful, because Dr. George wasn't in town.  And one time I got to see the PA.  But never once he said just go to Urgent Care if it's that urgent and we don't have any openings.  And if he prescribes you with something, he always has his staff follow up a few days later to check if the drug is working or not, or time to see a specialist... which I think it's pretty rare.  Most Dr. just see you, take your $, give you your prescription.  Who does follow ups anymore? They do!    I am surprised to see many bad reviews of his staff. Maybe the bad ones left?  Everyone I've encountered at this office are all very nice and helpful.  Summer, one of the staff, always calls and checks on me a few days after my visit with Dr. George.  And she reports back to the Dr. what my outcome is and then she'd call me back with Dr's order.  I think this is pretty sweet.  I have no complains at this office.. maybe I should make some up to make people not come here so I can wait less next time?  But that wouldn't be fair and everyone deserves to have good doctors who care, listen and try their best to help you.  Doctors are also humans, not magicians.
1 Customer service was terrible. They scheduled a massage for me when the office was closed. Got there, the door was locked. I called the office and left a voice mail. Received a call back 30 minutes later stating I was being charged for the massage even though I was there and couldn't get in.   Could not believe how rude the person who answered the phone was. Beware.  Trying to get my money back but seems impossible.  Beware!!!  They are after your money!!!
1 I used to go to their location in Burbank, ca and would buy the 5 sessions package. Last time I went there, I only used one and a half session and without notice they're closed. Tried calling and leaving a message, but got no response. Next is state agency for this kind of really unethical way of business.
4 Dr Domer surgically repaired my son's broken wrist and all in all I am happy with the experience.
3 I've been going to this doctors office for many years. My doctors have come and gone, (they moved) but I'm still here. Not the best doctors I've ever had but beggars can't be choosers here in Las Vegas. The facility is clean. The staff is helpful, alot of the staff has been here as long as I've been a patient. I do usually feel rushed and sometimes it's difficult to get someone on the phone to answer a question, but I've learned to live with that in Southern Nevada. Luckily I have some medical knowledge, helping to know what kind of questions to ask. Get well soon!
5 Awesome staff!!!very help and fast,clean and comfortable too. The place to go when you're feeling ill ;)
5 I went to Kempton Physical Therapy for the first time 2 weeks ago. I had never seen a physical therapist before so this was a new experience. I was pleasantly surprised.  It was very comfortable, clean, modern and the people there were friendly, helpful, respectful and professional.  You could tell they were all very comfortable with each other and a well functional team. My exam with Paul Kempton was great. Within minutes he was able to see the specific areas that needed treatment and formulate a plan to work on.  He is upbeat, enthusiastic and encouraging to his patients.  He reviewed the extra information that I brought to best understand my personal goals. I would highly recommend this office.
5 I have been going to AZ Chiropractic for a year now. I love the ambience and how nice they are there. I found them via internet one day when i was aching really back. They took me in right away and were able to fix the problem!!!
1 Terrible wait times and terrible reception staff. Dr. Rasaratnam is great. However, you wait for an hour even to get into the room. And then you could be waiting another half hour before you even see her. It feels like the appointments are so rushed that you can't say anything. The reception staff are brutal. I needed a medical release form signed and they hadn't done anything a week later. I called them, was put on hold for 25 minutes all to be told that they didn't look and the one woman who could do the forms was sick and wouldn't be back for another two days. I called back the next day, 15+ times with no answer. I finally got through to be told that the ONE woman who could do the forms was away again. When I asked her if she would be back the next day her response was "I hope." I expressed my frustration so, the woman put me on hold for 10+ minutes and she eventually found the form from a week ago. I asked her why only this one woman could give the doctor this form to sign and she didn't make much sense when she answered. Now I have to call back again tomorrow to see if the one woman is in to hand it to the doctor to sign. This is such a simple release form that I need for my severe back surgery. You would think they could respect my medical condition and get this one simple form back to us but, it has been a long time. Will not go back to this clinic. The reception staff don't know how to receive a simple form that is faxed and simply get a signature from the doctor.
5 Laura is one of the most amazing massage therapists that there is!!! She continually educates herself on different types of massage therapy and how it affects the body in order to help her clients. Her knowledge of the body, muscles & human physiology is refreshing. If you're looking for a massage therapist that goes beyond giving you a massage and listening to you unload your problems of the day on, then Laura is the only choice! I know because I always feel better after I leave..... That can be said for for all of the other clients that I've met in passing at her practice. Her work is worth twice the price and absolutely worth every dime...... Want to feel better? Go see Laura!
5 I've been a patient here for 3years and then my Dr left, I wasn't too sure about staying at WFP until I met Gayle Milek. Gayle is a NP who is definitely skilled. She takes her time to explain things to you and doesn't talk over you, with medical words that I don't understand. Since I've seen her, my blood sugars have been better than ever. I finally have more energy and feel like I'm on the right track.
5 The owner Joe is very thorough and cares about his clients. I'm from NY and so is he and he made me feel very comfortable being it was my first time for physical therapy. His wife at the front was incredibly kind as well. I was seen an hour earlier.
5 My favorite crystal shop . The owner Tammy is always friendly and helpful and the classes are great
5 They have been so kind and understanding.  Humana is such a pain to deal with .. Dr k and Dr Mc junction are just wonderful .. Dr m was doc of the year in 2016!  They r up on all the new procedures .. I have been in horrific pain and the The Lord sent me here.  The neuro stimulator trial worked!  I have been tortured w multiple surgeries, injections, etc.  Don't go to Laser Spine Institute .. 30k and MORE pain.  These people r Sooo awesome.  Steve g. Has been a Godsend!  I have been bed bound and crying for years and that is w pain meds!  He got me a cancellation and took care of everything .. such a blessing .. so caring and professional.  I put them on my Province site of 4000 homes .. emailed them all about what a wonderful place this is .. I moved from nm so I could come to this pain management offc.
5 Love both Bikram yoga and this studio!! If you are hesitant about trying Bikram yoga - just take the leap!! The staff is very friendly and the instructors are great. I have been to one other studio in the valley, and it doesn't even compare.   One thing I love abt Bikram Yoga is the energy inside the room. How everyone in the class is in it together. No judgement! Like we're all trying to better ourselves, wherever we might be in life.  My husband and I just came back after a long break, and are loving it! Ironically, it's a great workout for AZ summers, as you'll probably feel cooler while sweating inside a heated studio than outside. ;-)
5 I love Dr. Williams and have been seeing her for about fifteen years.  Her wait times are a little extensive, but you can tell that she really cares about her patients.  She spends as much time as is needed to make me feel comfortable with any questions I have and always remembers my kids and  family and medical history.  I absolutely adore her and continue to go even though I know I will have to wait. It's worth it to have a doctor who truly cares about your well being and is willing to do whatever it takes to see you well.
5 The Athletic Gaines family is truly amazing.   They care about their athletes and want to see them succeed.  All of the trainers are top notch.  I am especially thankful for Dwight Ross.  He has made all the difference in my son's life.  He goes above and beyond as a trainer and genuinely cares about his athletes.  He is not only a great trainer, but an even better person. My son's confidence and athletic skills have gone up tremendously as a result of Athletic Gaines.
5 I love going to therapy, yes my mother had me tested & no I am NOT crazy! I have worked with almost every PT & PTA in the clinic & they are friendly, funny, knowledgeable & professional.  At first glance I didn't know what to think, but wow here I am 4 weeks into my PT & it's like family, it's felt like this since my 2nd visit and I look forward to all my appointments and the pain I have to endure is minimal after doing ice therapy afterwards!! My PT contact is Nicky & she is caring for my right shoulder and when I expressed my concern of problems with my left she advised me to do the same exercises to prevent any other surgeries! They go in depth to explain your injury and what they are doing & what you need to do to aid your recovery.  I couldn't be happier with my recovery progress and how everything is going, it will be a sad day when I have to leave there (bittersweet)!
5 We established Dr. Peter Reed as our primary care physician last year and couldn't be happier with our choice.   I've never liked going to the doctor's office before, but I like going here because I know that I'll be seen promptly and receive competent care!
5 Dr. Nicole Cain has surpassed my expectations as a Naturopathic Doctor.  Her heart shows when she engages with patients because she truly has the utmost compassion for them.  Her main goal is to help patients get well and she does that exactly!  Dr. Cain is warm, easy to talk to and free of judgment.  I trust my health and the health of the most important people in my life in her hands.
5 Dr. Fereidouni is truly amazing! As a patient, I have never experienced a doctor spending time to really explain my medical questions in layman terms. I can address any medical needs there at his office and don't have to go to a ton of specialists (my last PCP always referred me out). He doesn't rush through your appointment and it's not just another run of the mill office, pushing patients through. Dr. Fereidouni and the staff at Aveon Health care about their patients and make sure that your needs are met. Very easy and convenient to make appointments! I have never had a better experience and so thankful to have found a doctor I trust and PCP office I trust!   You won't regret going to Aveon Health! Amazing staff and not to mention their clean amazing office!
1 The one star rate is because they make you wait FOR SO LONG. The service itself is not bad and the staff are relatively nice, but they have no respect or consideration for the customers valuable time. I waited for more than hour and got a few minutes consultation only. It seems to be the norm rather than the exception.
5 Great doctors , they saw me on short notice few times. The receptionists are really nice and helpful, i  highly recommend this clinic. I must say everytime i go there i feel like they really care. I never waited more than 15 minutes to see a doctor and even if my family doctor was not available another doctor will take me. Thank you so much.
2 I sit here waiting for surgery i look back at my journey to this spot i feel TOCA is too big and a mill. I dont feel they took into consideration my life and amount of pain I am in with there countless appointments, consultations and of course co pays. $$$$$$ My doctor was ok when i saw him but i never felt like any really cared if i got better or not
5 I was originally seeing another physical therapist in the area who would have me complete one exercise in the office and send me away without any exercises to do at home.   I am SO happy I finally found this office. I have had knee and wrist pain for about a year, but I am finally feeling better now that I have started seeing Dr Manning.  Dr Manning is very knowledgeable, and you can tell he truly cares about his patients . Dr Manning and his staff spend adequate time guiding you through exercises and stretches in office, giving you additional exercises and stretches to use at home, and using adjunctive equipment (like electric stim, ice packs, taping, etc) as necessary. I highly recommend Dr Manning for anyone seeking a physical therapist.
3 Be prepared to wait. My appt was at 9:30 didn't get called back til 10:30 then had to wait for the PA. 3 stars because the phlebotomist with the tattoos was awesome
5 Went here a few days ago for botox and Juvederm after buying a groupon. I was helped as soon as I walked in. The staff was very friendly. They already had forms ready for me. The girl doing the botox was great! She even gave me ice and gel so I wouldn't get bruises. My last doctor who did my Juvederm didn't do that and I had bruises for a week! My only regret is I should have gotten a few extra units on my forehead. You can still see some baby lines. That of course isn't their fault... I would highly recommend this place! I still can't believe I got botox and Juvederm for under $500. That is an incredible deal!
1 Just went there this morning because this clinic was my only option on the weekend. I read most of the reviews and I hoped for the best!! At first everything went ok. Friendly on the phone and in person. I had an acute issue that I basically needed to see a doc for an Rx. It's true you only see PA's here. She was nice but seemed timid. Spent 2 minutes with me and told me what she'd prescribe. I have been to other urgent cares in Mesa and normally the docs are more explanatory  and helpful on pricing since I pay out of pocket. They weren't here.   Here's where my 5 star rating dropped to 0  I get to frys pharmacy and they tell me my RX will be $150 for anti-itch cream! I called the clinic back and asked for a generic brand.   I later get a call back from frys pharmacy saying they called in an RX that cost $195!! Huh?!   I had to get online myself to find the generic brand and see what pharmacy has it cheaper on GoodRx. I called this clinic back and told them that Walmart has it for $38! They must have a call center because it's always someone taking a message and saying someone will call you back.  I get a call back saying I can pick up my RX at Walmart for the $38. I said great! Which Walmart did they call it in at?? The guy didn't know and said it wasn't in the notes.. ok I'm assuming the Walmart down the road. Cool.   I get to Walmart, no Rx or anything. I call clinic back 4th time... I speak to someone different and she says Oh you were suppose to pick up the RX at our clinic.. Omg! No one told me!   So upset! I go back to clinic to get my RX form to take it myself to Walmart! I asked why couldn't you call it in?! She said it was because I listed Frys as my pharmacy. Oh my gosh! I asked for manager who's not there.. awesome. I'll call Monday.
1 This was a truly disappointing experience. I called in to let them know I was new to the area and I am looking to establish a new primary care physician and was currently experiencing some minor flu symptoms. I was able to get a "new patient" appt. 2 weeks out which is fine. When I expressed to the nurse that the symptoms were gone, in a very curt manner almost rude, she told me that's all the doctor would be able to see me for. If I wanted to be established as a new patient I'd have to get a physical and that this doctor did not do handle that process. I attempted to explain that that is the main purpose of my visit and was cut off again rushed into the waiting room. Dr. Raymock seemed disinterested from the get go and seemed to have no interest whatsoever in establishing any type of rapport. He seemed very rushed and unapologetic that I was not being admitted in the correct protocol. Idk why I was treated like a burden. I was just trying to find a new doctor. I didn't complain nor was I rude. I'm still a bit shocked at what I just experienced.
1 HORRIBLE!  I got a work injury and my company recommended me to go to ConCentra the wait was so long it took three hours to see me which I understood because I was walk in so for my next visit I schedule a appointment it still took them 2 hours to see me even with an appointment! After waiting for an hour I walked up to the counter and I'm explaining to the receptionist a Hispanic girl with red hair that I had a appointment and why would it take so long to see me with an appointment she then turns to a different receptionist lady hands her my paperwork and says can you deal with this I don't time for this! While I'm  standing extremely rude!! The other receptionist explains to me why is it taking so long and then she told me she gave my paperwork to the doctor it won't be that much longer! I will never use them again!!!!
5 Dr. Charniga is an amazing woman in every way. She is an intelligent and experienced clinician but her outstanding characteristic is her gift of compassion and the ability to put the dying at ease. She cared for my father during his final illness and I am eternally grateful for the connection she established with him during that sad time. She's a miracle!
2 The lady at the front desk is nice, and I love the classes (especially legs, bums, and tums), but the free personal training session was mediocre. I met with a male fitness trainer who mocked my half push-up (said it "wasn't a real push-up, it was nothing"). I was taught this half push-up from a previous female fitness trainer & looked it up on YouTube after only to see that this is a perfectly acceptable push-up for beginners attempting to transition to a real push-up. I know I'm fairly weak, but an encouraging attitude wouldn't hurt. And he was really unfriendly too, so watch who you get, and I would say if possible, stick to the classes.
3 Expect at least a 3 hrs appointment. Overall, I finally get an MRI that I wanted for my back injury
5 Everyone here is very very nice & helpful. I come here on my 30 minute lunch & usually am in & out & back at work within that time frame...but I work pretty close to the office so take that for what it's worth. Dr Belsky is funny & pretty easy to deal with. If I need a referral for anything it's taken care of quickly & I appreciate the follow up. The girls at the front desk are funny & helpful & it's always a pleasure to see them. I had foot surgery a few months ago & when I hobbled in on crutches they were quick to help me through the door & into an exam room. I greatly appreciated the genuine concern shown by all.
5 Awesome group!  Did chiropractor, awesome massage and acupuncture today!  Wonderful experience! Thank you!
2 Let me start out by saying my wife and i really like Dr. Joel Morton.  When my wife moved to the valley a couple of years ago we did a lot of research to find a doctor she trusts.  Unfortunately, Dr. Morton has semi-retired and moved whats left of his practice, along with his JERK Physicians Assistant Anthony Nelson. She recently went in for an examination and to talk about menopause.  Dr. Morton is impossible to schedule with due to his reduced schedule so she made an appointment with Anthony.  He was rude and didn't want to address any of the issues my wife had on her agenda, he made it all about Him.  He wanted to lecture her on weight loss instead of address her questions, she knows she needs to lose 20 lbs and is on weight watchers, but that's not why she went to see him.  The facility "Campus" is very sterile and they treat you like a number, nothing like when Dr. Morton had his own practice.  We are back to searching for another informed, polite, respectful and attentive doctor.
5 Rick & I were in Scottsdale for 6 months when I developed low back pain. Dr. Chad was excellent at treating me and guiding me back to complete health. It was refreshing to have such a caring & knowledgeable Chiropractor. Thank you for your guidance!!  I would highly recommend him to anyone! Along the journey we enjoyed getting to know him as genuinely great person! We will miss you as we head back to Michigan. See you next fall! Thank you..Bonnie
2 Dr. Laura is very snide, rude, and quite frankly a smarta**. She tries to rush the appointment each and every time, doesn't spend enough time getting to know you or your child, and makes snide snappy comments at each appointment. The nurses in the back are quite rude, and obviously do not care about your child at all. They will even LIE on the child's records (example: they didn't take my daughter's measurements, then wrote down a random number on the paperwork, which then resulted in the doctor coming into the room to redo measurements because "if those numbers were correct, then my daughter shrunk" doctor's words, not mine.) They just stick the vaccinations into your child's legs and run off, no care in doing the vaccination.  Dr. Tresa is also very rude and condescending just like Dr. Laura. She likes to make very rude comments about why you are not breastfeeding your child (doesn't matter what the reason is), she also likes talking to you like you're stupid. Dr. Robinson acts like it's an inconvenience to talk to you about what is going on with your child after hours, when he is the doctor on call. He tried telling me that my daughter's fever was nothing to worry about until it hit 103.0 (she was only 4 months old).  I had an appointment scheduled with Dr. Laura, the office decides to call me right before closing 2 days before the appointment, to tell me to reschedule since Dr. Laura is all of a sudden out of town, but then they want me to wait a MONTH to see her.   All in all, I would not recommend this place. Take your child to someplace that will actually take the time getting to know you and your child, who visibly cares about your child's health and needs. Do not waste your time on this place. I will DEFINITELY be finding a new doctor.
5 Stephanie is a gifted, beautiful soul! She brings a special level of healing to the already proven benefits of these wraps. I've seen a significant effect in the deep detoxing of my body, as well as  support in my soul/mind expansion through the meditative environment she creates.
1 I saw 2 different Dr.'s at this practice in Mesa and both experiences - TERRIBLE! The demeanor is cold and uncaring from both Dr Skrocki and Lewis. Dr. Skrocki tells me in a stone cold tone that I probably have M.S, walks out of the room to figure out how to order a test and never came back! What kind of Dr says that to someone with no neurological testing, on a Friday & can't even get the referral completed for a week! What a poor bedside manner to send a patient into a panic and then just leave. I will NOT be returning here after my referrals are complete because point blank - they do not care and the service they provide is less than mediocre. If you have a real problem, please do not waste your time there because you will not get better with any of the Dr.'s there.
5 It was crowded when we arrived, but we did not have a long wait.   Everyone, and I mean everyone from the front office people, to the doctors, to random people walking by who worked there was very friendly. I was met with a smile by everyone.  The computer didn't record the forms I filled out online and I apologized to the guy who brought me back to the room (forgot his name) and he said they were having computer problems and typed everything in for me. And you know how sometimes even though they say it isn't a bother, but you can feel it is and they are annoyed- so not the case. He was wonderful.   Dr. Scott seemed like he knew what he was doing, took the time to even point out the break in my xray to my little boy and answered his many questions. He didn't act like he needed to get me in and out as quick as possible and made sure all my questions were answered.  Rick the guy who did my cast was awesome as well. You could tell he took great pride in his work and cared about his patients.   I saw that they were voted as one of the best workplaces in the valley. You can see that in the pride every employee took in performing their jobs. The place was clean and very nicely decorated.   I would recommend this place to anyone.
5 After my daughter had her ACL repair surgery done, We were referred to Total Sports Therapy for her knee therapy I got to tell you this was the right place for her rehabilitation. Professional staff that know exactly what they're doings The results my daughter is having are unbelievable can wait to see her play Soccer soon.Thank you to all the staff at Total Sports Therapy.
5 My experience from scheduling to final session was exemplary. Jessica is thoughtful and kind, and helped me feel comfortable from day one.  Dr. Sherman is awesome. I'm not a pro (or even semi-pro) athlete, but was referred by one of my friends who has completed a couple ironman competitions. She said he's the best in the business. I had to do more sessions than he initially thought, but man, my Achilles doesn't hurt anymore and I'm able to run further and faster than before my treatments (which wasn't even my goal-- I just waned the sometimes sharp/shooting, sometimes aching pain to stop). I did the exercises he recommended as well as allowed my body to recover, while he used tissue massage to promote healing.  I'm almost sad to not see the Doc and Jessica anymore but am super happy to feel so great!   I completely recommend Dr. Sherman for your sports-related injuries!
5 Dr. Kim has been my primary care physician for more than 10 years now and I cannot be happier.  He has been very caring and only think about whats best for the patients. I highly recommend him.
5 As I have moved several times within the past few years, I was expecting a hassle to get established with a decent GP. I don't have outstanding medical issues but what I DO need is to have office staff and my MD listen to my past medical history and determine what my needs are, and meet them without me having to jump through hoops or pay all sorts of additional fees for tests and other "billable items" that are not indicated. When I moved here, I happened upon this place, had only catastrophic coverage (so pay out of pocket) and was expecting the run around. I was pleasantly surprised. I've never had to wait more than a few minutes, appointments are easily scheduled and Dr. Kinel actually takes the time to listen to what my problems are and asks questions.   I am now within network of providers through my employer that does not include this office sadly, but I will continue to pay out of pocket to come here. That should pretty much say it all. These days, it is increasingly difficult to obtain routine medications let alone make appointments and a nightmare if you're sick! All the folks at this office are incredibly kind, knowledgeable and efficient. I never have to wait long and it's a newer, very clean environment. Many thanks and I would absolutely recommend!
5 Dr. Or is the best doctor! He is very knowledgeable and professional. I highly recommend him!
1 Note: We met wonderful caring nurses and hospital staff and we met seriously burned out staff that have become robotic and callous to patients and family. We met sensitive loving individuals who are an asset and gift to the medical field and we observed students laughing outside of a room with no supervision moments before our loved one died.   Unless you or your family are a burn victim, my recent experience is AVOID this hospital at all cost! I just finished going to UMC for 23 days straight as an advocate for a close family friend. He was 46 years old and this was one of the worst situations I have encountered.  He went in with possible pneumonia, however Doctors were not in agreement on that diagnosis. Doctors never communicated to the family during our stay the exact reason for his illness. There was a suspicion he had an underlying serious illness but final test results were never communicated.  Even with this overarching question, there was no reason to create an environment where a person literally suffered for days. We were told by a Doctor a few minutes before his death that he was now in Septic Shock. A hospital bacteria-look it up.   These are a few of the area UMC fell short in: 1. Lack of adequate communication to family For Example, tests results were not communicated as a matter of procedure. I would have to keep asking over and over and leave messages etc. 2. Hospital systems fell short. For example: he was given 3 different teams of doctors. If you keep changing doctors there can be a breakdown in communication 3. Lack of collaboration between hospital staff in general 4. Unclean hospital. For example on 3 occasions I had to call for cleaning staff. To my knowledge week-end staff is cut back. I observed blood left on floor for over 48 hours. 5. Failure to set up systems of checks and balances for critical life threatening decisions a doctor may make. For example: one Doctor deciding to order an invasive test on a patient who is already suffering from a weakened immune system, low platelets and fragile condition. One Dr. Later Walked in to the hospital room after realizing the patient was now in trouble and stated, "Who ordered that test! " And seemed in shock. The patient was returned to ICU following this event and died within 48 hours. 6. Failure to supervise medical student appropriately (See first paragraph). 7. There were also, possible infractions committed on the patients DNR wishes (Pending information).  For example, I was told by patient, "Absolutely No"   He was, so I am unclear as to why or if paperwork was incorrect.     My friend is gone, I hope this review saves someone else from the trauma and helplessness and possibly a life.
5 Overall this is a great place to go to. I highly recommend coming here. Great doctors, and great staff!
5 I have to admit I was skeptical about seeing a chiropractor...Having said that, I could not have been more wrong!  I think I'm in love!  I wish I had been educated about bone/spine health while in was in my youth...waiting until your in your ##'s is not a good time to find out that all my pain / suffering could have been eliminated YEARS ago if I would have taken better care of myself.  So, let this be a lesson for all you 20/30/40 somethings!  SEEK HELP NOW!  I had a very comprehensive exam with xrays and consultation, then I was forced to have a massage....yeah I love to be forced into that position!  Then I was given an "adjustment"...I have to tell you that it was painful...but it was a good pain...The staff are wonderful, patient, professional and treat you like they've known you forever.  The doc...well...not only is he eye candy, but really knows his stuff!  I was IMPRESSED!  I look forward to being forced into impossible positions again tomorrow!
5 We never have to wait long to see the PA and the onsite lab is very convenient.  The PAs we have met with have been very helpful and have never rushed our appointment.  They take time to really listen and have a conversation and come up with a game plan.
5 I love Dr. Vu!  I delivered my son Julien at St. Rose Hospital and I was originally going to take him to a woman up near us in the SW, but because I delivered at Siena campus in Henderson, she asked Dr. Vu to come check up on Julien because of the drive!!!  Well, I am so glad I had a chance to meet him because he cared so much for me and my son while we were in the hospital.  When I found out that he also has a SW location (FYI 6070 S. Rainbow Blvd, Suite 10 Las Vegas, NV 89118) I was so happy to make the switch.  My son is only 3 months old, but in the few visits that I've had to Dr. Vu (including immunizations and circumcisions) I really trust him!
2 My old doctor went out of business and I've been having a hard time finding a new one I like. The last time I came here I was here for two and a half hours - I guess they were just running really behind and that was for an appointment first thing in the morning. I also have one other huge complaint: They referred me to a orthopedist all the way downtown rather than someone close by and when I got there for my appointment this office hadn't sent my records and x-rays so they had to reschedule my appointment. I was so frustrated I could scream. Though not everyone is always on top of their game, everyone is always friendly and I love Dr Brown and he's who is keeping me at the practice for now.
5 Dr. Mike and his staff are great. It's been a few months since I've been in for care and the experience is always the same, friendly and I get the care I need. The courtesy of the staff and Dr Mikes attention to detail when preparing my care plan and explaining what I need gives me confidence I'm being well cared for.   I talk with my co-workers who complain about the same problems, they continue to go to the Dr. close to their home, or the latest chain chiropractor to get help because it's convenient or cheaper. They are constantly going back and spending time and money on multiple trips, but after a few trips to CC I'm all fixed. That's a win in my book!   Thanks Dr. Mike, u have a patient in me as long as I need chiropractic care!
1 If I could give 0 stars I would. We are visiting for work out of town and while here my daughter got sick with a fever of 105.8 and when we went in the check in lady was great the nurse was great and the doctor was the worst! Don't go here. Why wouldn't you let us know you don't have the resources for pediatrics at the beginning rather than let us be there and tell us at discharge. The doctor. Dr. Wallace seemed angry when he walked in and tired. I get that doctors are exhausted but have some freaking compassion. He didn't talk to us except for at check out he talked to the nurse didn't tell us labs he ordered just ordered them, didn't explain what he thought was happening or what he was looking for. When he asked why we were there I began to explain to him and he let out a huff of get on with it. Excuse me? But I figured you'd like to know what was going on and how this happened. I've never had such a bad hospital visit in my life. My daughter isn't even a year old. When I asked how much Tylenol I should give her he just said I don't know calculate it. Wow. Just wow. In a scared mother who is worried sick about her child!!! If you go to this hospital I highly recommend you don't see this doctor.
5 Dr. Peter is the best chiropractor I've ever seen.  He listens, is thorough, and what he does is so much more than adjustment.   Every visit he gets to the deeper issues, helps you talk out what's going on in your life that could be negatively affecting you physically.   So many of us walk around with pain inside that we don't address.  He then aligns everything so you literally walk out feeling like you can conquer the world!  He has helped me with issues I've had for years; that others have not addressed or thought they could do anything to help.  Every visit is an adjustment from head to toe. Dr Peter never leaves anything out and addresses all of your issues and concerns. I'm so thankful I met him.   One of my shoulders has been higher than the other for a few years now...we talked about it during my last visit.  He did some muscle work and by the time I left it was dramatically improved.  I could literally see the difference immediately.  I couldn't say enough good things about him.  His hours are super flexible with evenings and Saturday hours available.  Dr. Peter is conveniently located at the I10 and Warner in Ahwatukee so it's great I can run over there during my lunch.   Although if you don't live close...he is worth the drive!!!  Whatever you've got going on...call Dr. Peter.  I've referred a ton of friends to him and every single person has been ecstatic about the care they received and the relief... even on the first visit.   Thank you Dr Peter!
2 I don't have any complaints about the care I've received here and never have, but ever since stupid-ass P.C. Banner took this place over, they've had a no-guns sign up which is essentially an invitation to mass murder. Almost every single mass shooting we've had in this country has taken place in a "no guns" zone. Almost. Every. Single. Fucking. One. I realize that we've had a huge influx of Californians of late, and they find openly carried weapons very offensive--especially the men, who might hit someone with their purses if they see it--but banning the discreet carry of firearms by responsible individuals can only make the clinic less safe. There is absolutely no rational justification for banning firearms which are properly holstered and kept out of sight.
3 Had a TB shots because I accidentally poked myself with the same syringe I used to inject my roommates dog with insulin and had a panic attack! Thought I had caught rabies or something crazy!  Came here and was seen right away. Staff was friendly and alert. Place was clean with a HUGE waiting area. The shot hurt like a mother-trucket but apparently it's expected.
5 I am a PGA professional and personal trainer. I have had back pain for 40 plus years and have tried all modalities of pain relief from yoga, Chi Kung, and acupuncture to chiropractic adjustments, physical therapy, massage, spinal injections, stem cells and bought every contraption invented to supposedly help alleviate back pain.  I was almost ready to resign myself to a life of unrelenting pain and disability until I found Southwest Spine and Sports and Dr. Wolff.  It has been such a relief to finally find a doctor and entire staff who understands chronic pain and has the cutting edge skills to treat it. They really do care about their patients. People don't care how much you know until they know how much you care.
1 After a 7 year history with this office, we've decided to move out and find another Doctor.  This office was great until some money making negative policy decisions were put in place.  They now charge an annual $49 Administrative Fee at the beginning of each year from all their patients, basically a huge bonus and further, they require seeing their patients every 3 to 4 months just to get refills of standard or common medications.  Additionally, I've had to contact them several times to have the correctly coded for insurance.  The biggest problem for us was not getting refills on our medication and our medication being held hostage for regular visits every 3 to 4 months whether we are ill or not.  Most people only get 3 sick visits per year with their insurance, as is the case with us.  They have become a money making racket, on top of that, they have become rude and snobbish.  There are plenty of other clinics that do not charge the annual fee nor hold your common medications hostage for regular in office visits.  I say, patient beware and recommend against using this office.  This is terribly unfortunate for the good doctors in this clinic - their bad policy wil scare away their patients.
5 After my first massage with Jacky, it's safe to say I'm jumping on the Step Up bandwagon. Recently, I have been experiencing symptoms of meralgia paresthetica (numbness in my leg) for which my doctor had prescribed some rounds of RMT. I had tried a couple of other places prior to Step Up for massages and, while they were okay massage-wise, didn't really do anything to help with the symptoms I had been experiencing.  Which is why it was such a relief to hear that Jacky has dealt with many cases of meralgia paresthetica and gave me the assurance I had been seeking that with his knowledge of massage, in addition to his chiropractic background, that he could fix it.  I won't lie: a lot of what Jacky did HURT. But he had warned me that it would. None of it was long, or lasting, but definitely tested my pain threshold. Yet, at the end of it, I felt a difference - years of tension in my shoulders and recent aches in my neck/lower back had noticeably lessened. There had been a strain in my neck I hadn't even realized was there until...it wasn't!  To be honest, of all the practicioners the website allows you to choose from, I chose Jacky for a number of reasons: prior reviews, the need for more than a gentle hand & the impression that all the hours he spends at the clinic meant that it was probably his business and what happens with each client MATTERS. And I was right.  I hope everyone takes this review into account when choosing Step Up - this many 5-star reviews CANT be wrong. Obviously, it won't always be perfect, people with different problems require different solutions. The best part about Step Up is that they will work to find that solution for you. And at an affordable price, even if you're not covered. (But if you ARE covered, the clinic can direct bill MOST insurance companies on your behalf - bonus!)
5 Dr bigelow  rocks ! Man is straight  to the point and realistic about the solution the the problem. If you are passing stones them this is your man to help you out.  Located on 48st and chandler. Easy parking, wait to see the doc was about 10 min.
5 I have been going to Dr Petrick for 1.5 years and have seen some great improvement in my neck, beyond happy.  A few days ago I went for my hip as I could barely walk.  The pain was incredible.  Within 30 hours I was back up and walking and working out.  He isolated the muscle and spent a good 20-25 minutes releasing the tension. Absolutely incredible.  This is not $35 a visit DC.  You are paying a higher amount but getting an incredible value for the dollar spent.  If you want to show improvement and get fixed, Dr Petrick is the man.
1 I simply cannot describe how bad my visit was. I can't judge whether Dr. Page is a great doctor, since wait time to see him is currently 2 months (!!!) - is this the VA?? However, my visit with Dr. Meadows was a complete disaster, and her treatment plan (or lack thereof) was described as "absurd" by the next doctor to see me.  Save your health, sanity and money and go elsewhere.
4 Kind staff, and great treatment using acupuncture & chiro
5 Seek is friendly and accommodating. THey have helped a lot with DCS and DES. It is the best daycare/school/learning center around!
5 I've had 2 appointments with Dr. Sraow and my experience was very pleasant. The wait time for both appointments was short and he's very knowledgeable. He also went over treatment options for another issue that I wasn't being seen for which was very helpful!
4 A little pricey, but the front desk staff is very nice and the instructors are great!  It's also a great location, which is probably why it's so pricey.
1 I  was treated so poorly by a lady at the front desk I wish I could give this review 0 stars. Seeing the staff and sort of patients they have I am convinced they only deal with derelicts. The alleged "office manager" was so rude she made my temper boil. After driving 40 miles to see Dr. Stacy we were turned away for being late. I previously called to advise I was running late due to heavy traffic and construction. They said we had a 15 min grace period. I requested to speak with office manager and she sarcastically responded with an ugly smile "I am the office manager".   After feeling provoked by how offensively and the tone in this ladies voice (this lady was really abusing her "power")  and insulted by this so called "office manager" I requested to speak with Dr. Stacy firsthand.... misled that we had built some sort of rapport. The officer manager lied and said Dr. Stacy was in a meeting. I said how could that be possible when I just seen a patient go back to see her? The office manager smirked and sarcastically told me I can wait but she will not speak to me or be seeing me. WOW!  The unprofessionalism of this "office manager" was unreal.  Furthermore Dr. Stacy doesn't have any interest in building a progressive experience with her patients. 30 seconds of her time just to say I realize you have a driven a long way and I am simply too busy to see you today and I apologize my "office manager" has treated you in such a disrespectful way would have gone a long way! However I never will return to this dump.
1 The Office Manager treats you like dirt.  I went there for my appointment after it was approved by her.  When it came time, she said Dr. Allen was not on the Humana Insurance Card and so the PA could not see me.  I called Humana. Their system had the doctor on the list but was not showing up on my card. As a result, I had to go home empty-handed.  This is tantamount to malpractice since I didn't get seen by the doctor or the assistant at the appointed time.
1 After being diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis more than 6 years ago and being on the same medications for that time, Dr Sadowsky refused to write more than one month of prescriptions at a time in order to get me back in the office for additional appointments.  Most likely because her waiting room is always empty and I had never seen another patient there. She demanded blood-work that my insurance wouldn't cover and refused to either wait for my tax refund check so I was able to get it done or to work within my budget and select only the NECESSARY blood-work for immediate needs.  She cut my dosage of prednisone down, causing me discomfort even though her specialty was not Rheumatology.  Dont waste your time here unless you like having to nag your provider for what they are supposed to do on their own.
1 This is the worst doctors office I have every been to. At Family first you will never see an actual doctor, in the years I was going there I never once saw the actual physician.   If you ever have ANYTHING you need a follow up on, this is not the right place for you. In the time I have been going here I once had some labs I was anxiously waiting on and had to call them six times to get anyone to talk to me about them. This office has literally never returned a single phone call from me. The only thing they do well is schedule you for appts and then collect your copay.   Every time you go here you should expect to wait for 30 - 60 minutes past your appt time. If you ever do make an complaint about this the staff does not care.   Also After writing a review of their services on their facebook profile, they  removed reviews from their entire Facebook profile. That REALLY shows what kind of an office this is.
5 my cousins have been going to Michael G Wade MD for a long time,I was looking for a new Dr that actually cared about u and likes vitamins not like some that only want to dish out medicine!!! He had a wonderful attitude !!!
5 I have had major tail bone pain for over a year now. I hurt myself in the MuddRun. I kept thinking it would go away over time but never did. I finally decided to go to SpinalWorks. Today I have been able to get out of my chair after just one visit! I am definitely happy I went. The office is clean and the office staff are very friendly. Dr. Steve makes you feel comfortable and relaxed. If you have been suffering from pain I would make an appointment to check it out.
5 Cozy was great!!  She's incredibly accommodating and very pleasant. I've been to see her now three times and will continue to do so ;)
2 Although very good front desk service and nice facility, I had a pretty strange doctor visit and had horrible follow up service from both Dr. and office. Dr. Lauber seemed very uncomfortable with a general physical and could not seem to remember even my name?? The visit cost me over $1000? WHY??? Called 3 times and never got through to anyone in the office after waiting over 15 minutes each call. Had to eventually go down and get my records to bring to a new doctor to interpret test results. Ugghhhh...This place was bad.
2 3 hours on a Sunday and I'm still in the waiting room. Was told it would be 1 hour to 1.5 hours due to only 1 doctor being in today. I'm not even in a room. Staff is friendly but the wait is horrific!
5 First I love this place, the staff and especially Dovonna!!! A little back story...So in July of this year, I had surgery to remove my submandibular gland. After surgery I developed some complications and got an infection. This lead to a large lump of scar tissue. It was hard, painful and limited a lot of my head and neck movement. Another fun side effect was that it has been putting pressure on some nerves, which in turn has made the left side of my tongue numb. I stumble on to Blue Skyes from a google search, while looking for scar revision massages. When I contact them, I told them what was going and what I was looking for. Dovonna personally called me back and discussed some treatment options. I was told that it would take up to four appointments before I would see results but just after the first visit, I regained some feeling in my tongue, a lot more movement and all without pain! I ditched my anti inflammatory pills that day and did not need any more pain medication. I have finished my four appointments now and the difference it has made, is beyond my expectations. Dovonna has gone above and beyond anything any of my doctors have done for me! And if that wasn't the best part, I am also a crossfit athlete and even though I am not booked for her to look at my sore arm or to help open my hip flexors, she does that for me anyways! I love that my wellbeing is always a priority here. I highly recommend Blue Skyes for all of your wellness needs.
1 I'm so sorry, but I couldn't give this place more than 1 star.  Let me first start by saying for almost 2 months I've been trying to get my workman's comp situated. I work for the federal government, as you can imagine, everything moves slowly.  I chose to go Arizona Spine for my PT based on reviews.  I wanted the best place and I thought this was it. I was in contact with AZ spine for several weeks, trying to get everything in place. I noticed every time I called and spoke to (I don't want to mention the name) X, she always seemed eager to help and was very, very nice, but she never called me back even though she told me she would call me back "either way."  I let this slide, every time, since they had great reviews.  The workmans comp was just taking too long so I decided to just start PT and pay for it myself.  I made an appointment for yesterday for my initial consult and exam. The physical therapist was very nice, did a few things to ease up my pain, and showed me how to use the foam roller. She showed me 2 ways to use the foam roller and then she handed me off to the tech to show me the rest. So I hung out with the tech for awhile, but I didn't feel he was helping me like I needed him to and he just wasn't very friendly.  The physical therapist knew I was an avid gym goer and I wanted to be shown things that I could do to build up my strength using proper form so I could get back into the gym ASAP.  So, after doing some stretches with the tech, he said my session was over and showed me the exit sign and said you can go out that door to the front. So, I go to the front to make a follow up appointment. The clerk, is busy, scattered and just can't handle answering any questions. I asked how much follow-up sessions were and she said it's anywhere from whatever to whatever and then the additional fees based on what other services the therapist adds to my sessions. I've heard that a few times by now and I stated I'm not sure what that means since I wasn't given any recommendations or any type of real treatment plan. Mind you, my workmans comp hasn't been situated, so I'm paying for all of this out of my pocket, so I have to be pretty careful and know exactly how much this is going to cost me so I can determine how many times a week I can go.  So after getting a vague answer from the front desk clerk, having her hand me a price sheet of services that they offered with the cost breakdown, I was scheduling my appointment. I asked her how many times a week is recommended for me to come and she said "didn't she tell you?" I said no, she didn't tell me anything. I never saw the physical therapist again since she handed me off to the tech. I didn't even have a treatment plan. So, after talking to this frazzled, too busy to really help me and answer questions, i ran out of time and had another appointment to get to, so I never did find out how many times a week I needed to come in.  This happened on a Saturday(9/19/2016). Maybe some of the staff aren't very motivated. It did cost me $100, out of my own pocket and I'm not really sure what it was I paid for. This appointment was a disaster. I work in healthcare and I couldn't imagine just dumping a patient on a tech and never talking to them again. I've actually never had an experience like this before from a medical provider. I'm incredibly disappointed.
5 Although I have nothing and nobody to compare to, I must offer up a 5 star review. Why? After many years of playing on stage in bands, as well as endurance road cycling, I reached a point 5 weeks ago that prevented me from normal mobility (without pain), let alone doing the 2 hobbies that make me, complete. Last Saturday on stage is what sent me into a complete downward spiral with what I thought was sciatica. I kept thinking, it will go away soon. I'll just ignore the pain, as the show must go on! I had a referral from a friend and called for an appointment on Monday. I started with Dr. Parks, who specializes in sports med. I thought, OK, since I ride a bike, sure. With X-rays, he showed me where my problem is. Even though the pain is shooting down my right thigh, it was an issue with my L3. I smiled and nodded. OK, so what do we do? I was in so much pain that he was very reluctant to push with adjustments beyond some specific movements to help determine the problem and know where my breaking points were. This was yesterday. Today, I met with Dr. Skabo. He agreed with Dr. Parks, but also gave me further explanations on what was going on and why, as well as what the needed treatment would be. He made some adjustments and had me do more specific movements. This is a work in progress, as I'll return tomorrow, but I've been an emotional wreck with the pain lately, that I was not only unsure of what my future holds, but nervous in general about chiropractics! A future with corrections, adjustments, decompression and explanations, as well as recommendations on what to do and not to do, is far better than a physician just writing a prescription for pain meds. I like a natural approach and this seems right to me. I'm not "fixed" yet, but very comfortable and hopeful for my continued treatment through Copper Canyon Chiropractic.
5 Love love love!!!! I always leave feeling relaxed and fixed. Weight off my shoulders and headaches gone.
5 Dr.A.Agapay did a hernia surgery on my mother. Doing some research it was determined it would be 6 weeks of recovery, Dr.Agapay did it with robotics laparoscopically and she was up and walking within a few days and was back to normal activities within 3 weeks. He has a great bedside manner and a very calm demeanor. Are follow-up visits work quick with no wait time. Would highly recommend.
5 Total Physical Therapy is by far the best therapy place I've attended. Dr. Rikki and all the staff are knowledgeable and friendly. Every session consists of many specially designed exercises, manipulation performed by the doctor, and different modalities (ice, heat, tens, ultrasound, etc). The place is comfortable, very clean, and well equipped. All that to great background music. I'd highly recommend them to anyone.
1 Do not go here for a walk in.  The wait times are as bad as going to the ER - I could have gone to my own doctors office across the city and back in the time I've been waiting here.   Not impressed.
5 Great urgent care.  Brought my daughter here and there was no wait at all, we were the only ones at the facility at the time.  Doctor was thorough and the offer to obtain the medication on site was offered.  I would return here and would recommend this facility to others.
5 This place is amazing.  I had tried everything for my lower back problems short of surgery when I went to ATR.  I can't believe the improvement in my walking and standing after working with Chris.  Everyone at the center is friendly and professional.  I have had PT for my back problems previously, but this PT really worked.  I highly recommend.
5 Dr. Blackaby took great care of me! This was the second injury that he has treated for me. His philosophy is to not just heal the injury but to also help to get everybody stronger than they were before. His staff is incredibly friendly and knowledgable and I look forward to going in for treatments. I would recommend Dr. Blackaby to any of my friends and it's nice to know that I have someone to keep fixing my beat up body!
5 Our family has been using sunshine valley pediatrics for over 7 years. I was very excited that they opened an office in the SW location because that is closer to where we live. We usually request Dr. Laura who is a phenomenal doctor, after many many years of misdiagnoses by other pediatricians, Dr. Laura came to the rescue of my step daughter. Since then our 2 other kids started going to her as well. When she is unavailable we see Dr. Robertson who is an awesome pediatrician as well. The wait time can take a while at the Summerlin location which is where Dr. Laura and Dr. Robertson are at most of the time because that is the primary location but if I can get into the SW location for either of them i am usually in and out in a reasonable timeframe. I like that the sick children area and completely separate from the well children area (in response to the ladies review below, she probably didn't realize there is another side to the office where appointments are waiting so they weren't taking 'extra breakfast breaks') they are always very busy and dedicated to their patients.   Tip: Make sure when you call for an appointment that you specify which location you want first then the doctors availability at that location.
5 I usually see Dr. Trinka for adjustments and he is wonderful. I came for a massage today though with a recommendation to ask for Sylvia. I had requested her before and then ended up with another person. So today I know why my friend told me to go back and insist on seeing Sylvia. I thought the other massage was good but..  WOW. No it wasn't. Sylvia put her to shame! My one hour felt like 15 mins.! She found muscles I didn't even know I had and massaged them! The pressure was perfect. The music was low and relaxing. Not too much talking. She didn't make me feel like she was in a hurry. Slow movements and really concentrated on where I needed it most. EXCELLENT.
5 I have been coming here over the years for various injuries and maintenance. Dr. Mioni is great and very easy to work with. Dr. Rago is one of the most kind people I have ever met. Every office visit is very relaxing and professional. I would highly recommend anyone to AZ Chiropractic. If you have pain they will fix it!
4 I was not a patient; I just checked this place out with a friend. I will update this review after a few days. As of this writing, I was told this location was recently bought by a management company based in Nevada. The admission lady that helped my friend and I today was awesome! Her name was Angela D. She gave us a complete tour and answered all of our questions.  My friend was referred to this location by a friend from her church that used to work here.
1 It is a very inconsiderate office. They rather follow the their protocol than a patient in pain. I come here for heel pain. My doctor ordered an insole for my shoes to elevate the pain. I am in so much pain yet they would not give me the insole which is sitting in the office because they are waiting for the person I that department has to give it to me because that is proton and yet this person comes once in 2 weeks  yet I am suffering. I would never recommend this office to anyone
1 Dr. Saunders' office is now "paperless" which sounds good but it means that she does not mail out statements when you owe her money. Apparently her office emailed me a statement but it went into my junk folder and I never saw it. I didn't realize that I owed her $30. I went to her office 6 more times after that but I was never told that I owed her money. I went for over a year owing her $30 and was never told about it until Dr. Saunders sent me to collections for it. When I called Dr. Saunders' office to explain the situation to them, I was basically told "tough." They would not do anything to get it taken out of collections (even though I offered to pay them and had no other incidents of not paying). Their "paperless" system has serious flaws, which could cause their patients credit issues. They do not recognize that there are flaws and instead blame their patients. As a result, similar situations are likely to keep happening. That is not acceptable to me and so I will not be going back. Apparently Dr. Saunders is not very interested in keeping long term patients.
5 My first visit with Dr. SBaih  I was very comfortable talking with her about my needs . She understood and she is taking the time to accommodate me . It looks like this will be my primary physician. Awesome
5 These are the people you want to work with!  Five months after injuring my foot, I was still in pain and limping. Then, I started at 360 Physical Therapy. Its positive atmosphere encourages healing. The entire staff honors the dignity of each patient and made me feel like I belonged. The therapists are impressive and accomplished. They ensure that patients benefit from the most effective treatment plans. Within three sessions I was walking. Not far or fast, but the limp was gone.  Owen is knowledgeable, experienced, decisive and encouraging. He listens and explains what's happening in your body. When I couldn't do an exercise, he broke it down to its basic level until I could. As I healed and grew stronger, he made the exercise more challenging. He always respected my pain level. When I faced a setback, or felt discouraged, he reminded me how much progress I had already made. Now, I can walk two miles and the pain is manageable.   360 teaches you how to do the work. Your good health is the prize.
5 I came yesterday for my first in a while check up. The nurses here are great, very nice and comforting. The wait to see the dr is pretty long but they all take long. They do xrays in the same building also draw blood. The xray people are super nice and gentle which I love!
1 Beware!!! NASM is a mockery to the Fitness Profession.  My advise:  Do your research and talk to those who have had recent experiences with them. Check the positive reviews and you will find that they were paid to write those positive reviews.  Unfortunately , my experience with NASM left me disappointed to the extent that I have elected to consider  letting go of  my AFAA Certifications altogether.  Since NASM took over AFAA, sales people from their office have been e-mailing me, calling me, and all in an efffort to get me to renew "for life" for a "great price"!!! I told them that I was in no hurry, that I was up-to-date with my CEU and that I am considering mailing in  my payment.  They told me it was best to pay over the phone with my credit card and that they are doing away with mail-in payments because they get lost.  I asked a number of my colleagues and they told me the same happened but they could not turn down a good deal so they gave their credit cards over the phone for life-time re-certiifcations  but still have not received confirmation (8-12 weeks  still going).  I was skeptical about their operation so I asked for their CEO contact number.  They told me they were not at liberty to tell me.  When I discloce my concerns, the tone of their representative changed to hostile.  I wanted to discuss with them about my approved AFAA CEU credits that I have earned and paid for, they were not wiilng to acknowledge those credits which AFAA confirmed were  acceptable and became offensive. I was informed that I would need to buy another 9 CEU units and pay over the phone  but if I opted for "lifetime" recertification with them, they would throw in 3 free CEU and give me half off for my PT certification.  There were alot of wheeling and dealing on their end in an efffort to exytract as much money from me as possible.   I have nothing against corporate mergers and am in favor of progress.  What I wanted and needed to hear from them were updates of what they have done since they acquired AFAA.  I heard nothing to that effect.  I felt very uneasy about my conversation and so I told them I  would need to do some investigation and have a think. They did not care because bottom line, I was not comfortable giving my credit card over the phone;   I have been investigating and many of your reviews here concur with my finding.  NASM/AFAA has become a "business" about selling on-line course, offering deals, recertifying people for life with the intention of hooking them into their on-line courses in the years to come, and collecting credit card information.  They have no data base of Certified Instructors for all to see; they are only available for their sales people to see  with "optimizing sales" as their primary objective.  They may say that NASM objective is "excellence" but nothing of what they are doing points to that.   For years, I take great pride in what I do  for my  students and clients.  For me, being a part of NASM/AFAA  now would diminish what Health/Fintess/Wellness is all about.  We should  do what we do because we care about people, promoting health, educating people, and staying fit; Being certified should be a positive experience; it should not be all about buying on-line courses, giving people access to our credit card,  and  stressful follow-ups to get our certification, access our information, or get help.  NASM  sales people are nice when they are trying to pitch their sale; but beyond their scripted lines,  they have nothing helpful to say to you .  I highly recommend that if you are considering NASM /AFAA, go on full alert, do your research, talk around,  check carefully sources for the positive reviews, the dates of those reviews, and make your decision.    If you have had similar experiences, I urge that you share them your review.
5 I have been seeing Dr. Chris and his staff for the past 9 years. The team is a pleasure to work with and Dr. Chris takes time with each patient and has a great sense of humor.
4 Dr Erik Dean and the staff at AZ Sports Medicine Center were incredible! From the receptionist at check-in, to the nurse, to Dr. Dean and the x-ray technician, everyone was friendly and knowledgeable. Dr. Dean spent the time to talk to me about my prior injury and gave me options for treatment, he has great bedside manner, very friendly and speaks in layman's terms so a common person can understand. I would definitely recommend anyone to this practice!  Updated review because treat Kent didn't work at all and was $900 out of pocket. I would expect to feel some relief but didn't
5 I've been shadowing Robert, the Occupational Therapist, here at Affilaited Therapy and he's amazing! He's great with kids and so knowledgeable and creative with his therapy treatments. Jason, Destiny, and all of the staff here are so welcoming and friendly! Nice, bright, clean facility I would definitely recommend!
5 Went to Surprise Family Urgent Care for an issue with my leg. The time I was there I waited about 15 minutes. Great staff and very pleased with the Drs. Recommend highly.
5 Mr. Wu! Where have you been all my life?! Yelpers if you are looking for a chiropractor Mr. Wu just may be the AllState of chiros, why? because you're definitely "In good Hands!" lol. Upon meeting him you can tell how genuine he is in regards to your pain and discomfort as well as how knowledgeable he is with how the body works.   He really took the time to explain everything as far as what goals he has for me in getting my back aligned and his touch with his adjustments are phenomenal not to mention what soft hands he has! :) I've been coming to  Mr. Wu for quite some time now and I can truly feel the difference. Highly recommended guys!
5 I needed Aqua Therapy per the Doctor. I have been treated for over 3 years with procedures and medicine for the SI Joint and Periformis Muscle. This place gave me my life back! I know that sounds extreme but it really is true. I can move better and am now taking less meds. I just wish I was sent there sooner. I know use the rec center pools to do what I was taught there. If I ever need any kind of therapy again it would be there. Joan was my therapist. She was great! I do like that I had her every time. They get to know you that way and in turn you get more comfortable with them with every visit. From the moment you walk in that place treats you like family. That means so much today. Many other places are too rushed and cold to their patients. So a big THANK-YOU to Oakeson Therapy and especially Joan!!!
5 A big thanks to Dr. Reed who performed the Webster Technique successfully and helped my baby to turn. I avoided a painful outpatient procedure thanks to him...I'm so grateful. We have been seeing Dr. Reed now for 10 years and highly recommend him to all our friends :)
5 Fantastic RMT, knowledgeable, talented and professional, Inna is one of the best RMTs in the city. I have only had a few sessions with her and I already feel a drastic improvement in my back and neck muscles. During her sessions in her tranquil environment, Inna uses different techniques to relieve my tight, sore back and neck muscles.  She knows exactly what pressure and techniques as if she listens intuitively listens to my body's needs.  Inna is an incredibly gifted RMT who customizes each individual treatment to her client's preference. For me personally, she has been amazing at relieving all the knots and she even gave me some suggestions about my posture and advised helpful exercises to do at home. Whether you want a relaxing Swedish massage, a firm deeper massage or moderate sports treatment, look no further, give her a try. She has a healing touch and a genuinely caring, warm personality.  If you want to see results, I would highly recommend visiting Inna. Thank you Inna, I will be back soon!
5 WOW !!!!! If you want to see a dedicated staff and get your pain fixed go there. The Doctors are second to none including Dr. Vu and his assistant Mark. They have the most high tech doctors office I have visited and HIGHLY recommend them . Dr. Burkhart and his friendly staff will get you up and running in no time!!!! Stephanie the business manager helped me with my insurance, she was so nice and friendly!!!!!! HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND !!!!!
5 These professionals literally saved my life.  As an Athlete I had sunk into depression thinking my damage was permanent I was in complete despair when I walked through their doors.  2 months later I feel like a million bucks!   It was so worth the drive across town twice a week for treatments.  Best of the best!  Thx guys your amazing
4 The reason I'm rating this location so high is because I absolutely love my doctor (Mark Schlotterback).  I can't say enough great things about him.  Unfortunately, I have to agree on many of the other reviews about having to wait.  The waiting room is never that long of a wait, but once I get into the exam room, I'm lucky if it's less than 30 min.  I have seen other doctors at this practice, but none of them compare to Dr. S. He's extremely knowledgeable and a great diagnostician.  I can't say enough great things about him.  So unfortunately, my review might be a tad biased because of how great I think my doctor is.
5 Really great focus on overall health not just training. Staff will first guide you through the biggest challenge to most of us - nutrition, before you begin your training. You are really set up to succeed and get the most out of your time and effort. I highly recommend!
5 Dr. Briones is great! She is kind, thoughtful, insightful and caring. I am lucky to have found her as my primary care physician through Banner Health.  The staff is great too. Very friendly and helpful. The facility is clean and welcoming.
5 i am so grateful someone recommended this clinic. The lymphatic and body sculpting massages are wonderful. What a difference they have made in my well being. Davonna and Ydys are both so caring, talented, and professional. They love what the do and it shows! i would recommend Blue Skye's, and already have to friends & family!  Fran T.
1 It's time to change doctors. I can't handle an office that doesn't answer their phones, doesn't respond to refill requests, and calls you back FOUR (4) days after you leave a message & require an appointment to refill a med you've been on for 8+ years after you had blood work done less than six moths ago.
4 I love their scheduling practice-- you can make same-day appointments or an appointment the day before, so you can virtually always get in when you need it. The front desk ladies are incredibly friendly and always welcoming, and I adore my doctor. The office is clean, open, and much larger than you'd expect. I definitely recommend this place.
1 Absolutely horrible. Do NOT buy any Groupons offered by this place!! I purchased a 90 minute massage, called them and left 2 voicemails to schedule with no call back. I finally had to go in on person to make the appointment.  30 mins before my appointment , I realized I had a flat tire, so I called them right away to reschedule or push the appointment back a bit.  I was told there is a strict 24 hour cancellation policy, and that I was forfeiting my Groupon in full.  They immediately went in and redeemed my voucher that minute.  Understand when you prepay with them, they have no reason or desire to help you actually get the services you have paid for.  Once they have you money, their service ends.  Never ever again.  Wish I would've read other people's reviews here before I purchased!!
5 Was in from out of town on business and had major issues with my lower back. Filled out the mandatory new patient info and was in immediately. Dr Judge was very thorough going over my issues and past history. He did a complete head to toe adjustment which brought immediate relief.  I highly recommend the Joint and the expertise and Dr Judge and his staff.
5 This place was perfect.... I hate the doctors office like most people and always wait till the very last minute but not anymore. I came in with 2 issues that were completely different. The doctor knew exactly what both issues were and took care of both. I was in and out in no time. Myself and my family WILL be coming back in the future.
2 In person, the staff can seem friendly or helpful. But over the phone, they don't even bother. They've called me to show up early only to switch doctors on me. The office isn't very clean. I had hoped to never go back, but they wouldn't respond to prescription refill requests and I had to go in person to fix the situation. First they told me I would need to come in and be seen every three months for my refills, but when I began to question this they folded and gave me my prescription. They seem like they want to force you to have as much done as possible to line their pockets with your insurance (hopefully) money. I'm back to hoping I never need to go back.
5 This is a great office. The staff are professional and courteous, friendly and helful. My apointment was quick and went smoothly with great timing.   I love getting a copy of my lab work, even though they use their computers for just about everything, I still get my paper copy!  They see all ages, they provide comprehensive care , so I feel they are looking after all of me!   The office is located just off 215, on rainbow and sunset, close enough to my home, and easy to get too!
1 I don't write negative reviews.  I don't complain. I'm not some bitter customer who is angry about the way I was treated by customer service. But I have to share a review because at a facility like this you are dealing with life and death circumstances. This place simply is not up to the task. The incompetence of the employees and upper management is baffling.  If someone ran a business this way in any other industry, their doors would be closed. The only reason I can imagine this place stays open is because it's milking elderly folks on Medicare/Medicaid.  The government case workers must not be doing their job on evaluating this location's performance because they wouldn't even have to dig to find problems. Just a casual stroll down the halls would do it. The nurses that I have been involved with here must have a very limited nursing education.  They don't even comprehend some of the most basic health and body wellness principles.  It almost feels like you need to look around for a hidden camera because this must be a prank show. But unfortunately it's not.  It's just a big cluster of lack of accountability, lack of professionalism, lack of education, lack of communication.  They are not motivated to change or get better either.  Every failure on their part is met with "I'm sorry" and a shoulder shrug.  Don't let any of your family members come here unless you are just looking for a place that will check your loved one's blood pressure every day until they are dead.  But you might have to go in and diagnose the death yourself because the nurse probably will think that it's just really really really low blood pressure.  ***Update: thank you for reaching out.  At this time my family member is no longer in your care. He has been moved to another facility and is in the process of recovering from multiple issues arising from his lack of care at your facility.  Reaching out to your regional director will serve no benefit to me, but it may help you up line some of the problems occurring in your operation that you may or may not be aware of.  If this will prevent others from having a similar experience, then I definitely will reach out. First I will have to speak with our legal counsel as to whether not they recommend doing so at this point. Thank you.
1 Similar to another patients comments, we unfortunately saw Dr Agrawal who was not only unfriendly but was also extremely rude. She talked to my wife and I as if we were kids. When we confronted her she said she was overworked even though the clinic was empty. When we asked her for a referral she asked us to wait, left the office and didn't return!  We were extremely insulted. Next time around we saw someone else and got a referral. We were told they would contact the referral for us. Few weeks later when we never heard back we contacted them and apparently they never processed the referral so we had to wait a few more weeks.  The lady at the front desk is never with it and seems extremely absent minded.  Shame it's a good location for a clinic so had lots of potential
5 I can't tell you how amazing Sumit's yoga is, but it isn't everyone's cup of tea. Luckily they offer a great package for newbies to test it before committing to a long-term package which while it is pricey has been worth every dollar for me. There has only been one instructor I didn't like. Make sure you go to one of Kim Ewan's classes!
2 Note to self: don't ever review a place before the whole experience is done. My bad. A shame since it was highly recommended by a close family friend.   At first, I loved it here. Staff was warm and welcoming and very accommodating. Once you become a "regular" that pretty much changes.   The front staff Yvette (if she's still there) would always talk so open and freely about every patient without taking anyone's privacy into concern. This wasn't sometimes, it was ALL the time. The staff turnover here is a joke. Coming 2-3x a week and new people every time is a little crazy especially when they don't know what they are doing. I've been hooked up to things wrong, had my blood pressure read so wrong they had to check it again, and just a lot of confusion running around here. It's like going somewhere on everyone's first day and you're just supposed to assume they've got it. Except here they don't.   I ended up switching where I was getting therapy. Prior to switching, Dr. Peters had sent me for an MRI. I had to take the time off work to go get said MRI over a month ago now. Here I am STILL waiting for a follow up on it. I still don't know the results of the MRI. I called the office 5 days ago requesting them, and dr. John said he would get it emailed to me. Guess what I'm STILL waiting on. The freaking MRI which happens to be the only thing I'm waiting on before I can close my case and I honestly will be surprised if they ever follow up or give it to me given everything is a clustered mess here.   Save the time and the drive- with a PT place on every corner you'll be sure to find a better place to go to.
5 I was in a car accident 3 to 4 months ago in tremendous pain, I needed some adjustments cause I got pretty banged up. They totally took very good care of me, my pain levels are almost a 100% due to there expertise. I truly want to thank Dan, Joel, Roxy,Lisa and the rest of the Staff, you guys are truly the best! THANK YOU
3 Never too long a wait, it's got plenty of seating, and TVs on. It's quite a drive for me, but for my daughter to see PA Shields this is where we have to go. She's good, so it's worth it.  Plenty of parking, a couple crazy homeless people to add spice to the wait. The front desk people always manage to find what they need, but it's always a minute before they figure it out. Not sure why, just glad they do.
5 This is my first visit here so as it stands from this visit and my phone conversations with the staff, my rating is five stars. My grandma is the actual patient. We enjoyed her appointment today because she was treated with respect and dignity that she did not receive from her last PCP. Both of my parents are established patients with Michael Scott as well and they really like him and the staff. Our wait wasn't bad. Appointment was at 3 and we were out of there by about 4:30ish. I like the fact that Michael takes his time with patients and answers questions. He is very knowledgeable and kind as well. Thank you Michael Scott, the two medical assistants, and front desk staff for providing such a wonderful experience. My only "complaint" is that they don't accept smart choice Medicaid which is the insurance I have right now. They did however, recommend some place in the building that is a colleague of Dr. Welborn's.
5 I've been having migraines weekly for quite some time now. I've tried medications from my neurologist, prescriptions from doctors, physical therapy and nothing seemed to work. I decided to give Pain Solutions a try after getting a groupon massage which was pretty good. On my second visit the MD here applied a nasal spray in my nostril which honestly tasted very bitter but within 15 minutes my migraine was 10 times better. I followed that up with a massage from the therapist and a quick crack for the chiropractor. Left their feeling like a new man. I would recommend them for headaches.
1 Horrible and incompetent front staff.  They insisted they had to charge me for me yearly wellness exam. Good luck
5 This place is the best! Treatment is incredibly helpful and holistic. Everyone who works here is friendly and kind.
5 Went to Francesca Chamian for the first time almost a mnth ago. I have never encounter in all my years, a very compassionate doctor! While I was voicing my concerns, she was rubbing my back telling me she understands. Very thorough and very understanding of my problem. She is a diamond in the rough! Cannot wait to go back. I know she will give the absolute best care cause she cares!
5 Love it here. Front desk is always eager to help and answer any questions that you have. Therapists are kind, understanding, and on time. Had several different therapist at this location and I've not been disappointed once.
5 The receptionists were very welcoming and friendly when I first walked in; they are wonderful! I had a very short wait time before I was seen. All of the staff that I encountered was very friendly and took the time to discuss the reason for my visit and listen to my questions and concerns. Nathan was awesome and took the time to explain some of the symptoms I have been experiencing and the reasoning behind the medicine he prescribed. Because of some of the health issues I have been experiencing I was fairly anxious upon arriving at office but left feeling much more relaxed and confident in the care I was receiving. Thank you Phoenix Family Medical Clinic for the positive experience!
5 Dr. LaTourette is as good as it gets.  My wife felt welcome in his office from the moment we walked in until her procedure was finished.  She has not told me that her wrist was pain free in what seems like months, and 20 minutes after our visit she was in tears at the relief.  I can not give a better review.  5 stars+
4 I am out of town and not feeling good. I tried to find two other urgent care's, every time Google maps said I was there I could not find it. Decided to head back to the hotel. Googled Urgent Care found the office no problem. Very nice and professional, the front desk and the doctor. Got taken care of and feel better already! Great experience!!! :-)
4 I've been see Dr. Bruns off and on for over ten years.  He's always been extremely nice, approachable and caring.  This last time, I met with PA (I believe her name was Kelly) and she took quite a while with me trying to understand symptoms and possible causes.  She relayed the info to Dr. Bruns saving me the trouble of repeating myself.
5 This team of professionals saved me last Fall when I found myself unable to walk due to a hip injury.  I went diligently for almost three months and found their treatments superb.   Today, almost a year later, I found I needed to go back for an adjustment...just minor.    I was seen very quickly and referred to Casey who is one of the best of the best. She quickly diagnosed the situation and helped me feel better quickly.   I am most grateful!
1 Decided to write this after waiting for 50 minutes in a patient room for a normal checkup... my time is worth about $500/hour, Have been a patient here 6 years. They have switched doctors 3-4 times. I'd suggest finding another provider. Places that make you feel like they are doing you a favor don't get it. It's a patient mill....  I do like the physician assistant, she's very kind.
5 My boyfriend and I were looking for a chiropractor to help his pinched nerve. Being very cautious after hearing horror stories from friends we decided to look into the treatment.  After getting on yelp I found global chiropractic. I read the reviews and was convinced to try dr Steve. We have been going three weeks and he has helped my boyfriend and his pinched nerve. If you have to see a chiropractor you have to try global chiropractic they are friendly and make you feel welcomed.
1 I wish I could give nagtive stars!!!! Please stay away from this place.  I went there 20 days ago.  The doctor gave me a prescription that lasted 3 days.  At that time they drew blood and was told that the results will be sent to my primary care physician within a week.  I just called today inquiring about my lab results as my doctor has not received it.  The person on the phone acted like i was bothering him and told me, without even looking at my records, that it normally takes up to 1 month to get lab results.  i then asked if he could at least look, was agitated by this some how, and said that he does not have time to look right now but took my name and number and said that someone will call me when they can get to it.  Absolutely absurd!!!
5 I had the good fortune to find this place for my physical therapy after total knee replacement surgery. You are treated by a licensed physical therapist every time. I have been working with Shane who is compassionate but steadfast in accomplishing all goals.
2 I'm never going back to this place. I called in days ago and was told that although there were no appointments for today, I could be seen as a walk in if I got there by 4 since all I needed was a RX refill. This office is about 20 miles from my house and isn't a short drive. Anyways, I get in and am told that I can't do a walk in appointment today. I am not a new patient, I do not need an assessment, I am not injured, the PA-C only sees me for 2/4 minutes any other time and sends me on my way- ludicrous. Insane waste of my time and gas on my ONE day off. Fed up with this place and Las Vegas doctors that could care less about your health and wellness.   2 stars for Dr. Relph who actually cares. Dr. Ravi who I've only seen once and the convoluted front desk girls/body guards will never have to deal with me again.
5 My family have been patients of this practice for over 8 years. We have received nothing but the best care.  We are able to get appointments in a reasonable amount of time --given this is a SMALL practice with only 2 doctors.  When I've called needing an urgent appointment for sick kid or spouse they have always accommodated me as much as possible.  I try to be considerate and realistic about their scheduling limitations and have never felt brushed off.  Since they started using the electronic record system and keeping cards on file, they have never charged my card without asking me.  It makes the check in process so quick and easy for everyone.   Relative to someone else's complaint about them putting more responsibility on patients regarding insurance-  this is increasingly common given the changes in the insurance industry.  You should be informed about what your policy does and does not cover when seeking care and be prepared to pay for things up front instead of being billed. You don't get billed for hardly any other services you utilize.    I would and have recommended this practice to many friends and family!!
1 My experience during my last visit made me very uncomfortable, and my original 3 stars is turning into 1, because of the snotty phone calls I have received since. These people are rude, condescending and pretentious. I would never recommend this company to anyone.  Along with several of my coworkers, I went to the director of our company's wellness department, and we told them our complaints about this company. Our company is no longer using this company, because so many people hated it and complained, which should say something. When I went in for my first visit, it was clearly a money grab, and they told me, a healthy 25 year old, that I would need $4500 worth of work to get my neck straightened out, and 3 visits a week for a year. I have since gone to my mom's chiropractor, and she told me how ridiculous that claim is, and it only took two sessions with her ($100) for me to get all my kinks worked out. Don't waste your time with these people.
5 Love love love the program and trainers! I have never achieved success like this! The program is easy to follow and the workouts are challenging but fun! I look forward to seeing my trainers each day! I had a foot injury and they happily worked with me through it!  I successfully completed one challenge and I am signing on for another!
5 I took my child here because he was sick they were very nice we saw dr. Dani I hope I'm spelling that right he was very good and asked that I called a couple days later telling him if my child was better or not it showed he actually cared which I haven't received from a pediatrician in a while I was very pleased
5 I am a regular customer at modern massage, and for good reason, the massage therapists at the spa are great. They always cater to my needs. Great atmosphere; it was quiet and relaxing and I felt very comfortable, I highly recommend this facility.
5 I came in today as a new patient for a yearly exam. First thing when I walked in was how clean the office is. The front staff was so polite and very helpful. Once I was done with paperwork it only took approx 5-10 min to get called back. Once I was taken to my room Dr Lopez came in shortly after and was extremely professional and polite. I felt very comfortable and that nervous feeling when meeting a new doctor went away quickly. Defintly will be coming back for all my OBGYN needs and will be referring patients!
1 I started seeing Dr. Brass when this office first opened.  She was warm and welcoming and I got my robe based on what chakra I was feeling at the moment.  Unfortunately, I would always be waiting in the exam room for at least 45min to an hour each visit before I actually was seen.  I believe this was partially due to her being pregnant and then later the new baby being set up in her office.  This became too much of a hassle for me so I went elsewhere.    Fast forward a little over a decade, she is not so warm and welcoming anymore.   My husband and I were TTC and wanted to approach it in a more natural way.  I came back to Dr. Brass and repeatedly paid an outrageous $75 out of pocket per visit with our insurance. Once in the exam room, I felt interrogated with each question and none of my answers were ever good enough.  I'm not the doctor here and she made it very clear that she was above us in every way, down to the faces she would make while speaking to us.  She would walk in still talking to other patients outside of our room and then rush us through our visit.  We had to get multiple labs done, including one that was $1400, without any type of discussion about the cost.  I had to speak to the office manager to have her recode it and luckily it was smoothed out.  THEN I got a call from someone telling me I had to come in for my results.  Not only was I freaked out because it was something they couldn't tell me over the phone, they wanted me to pay for another $75 visit just to get my results!  I ended up leaving early from work because they had time to squeeze me in, got my husband to meet me there, only to find out that everything was NORMAL!!  I had one result that could be tweaked a little bit in which she gave me an rx for.  This is where it really took a dive for us.    I had an adverse reaction to the medication and it was a terrible, terrible night for me.  Both physically and emotionally (we're talking hormones here).  So much so that I had to call into work the following morning.  Being a Saturday, I had to call her on the emergency line.  She didn't seem too pleased with this and I was CLEARLY bothering her.  I told her the situation and she said "it sounds like you're just getting a cold".  I told her that was absolutely not the case and I was terribly ill from the meds.  She literally told me that it couldn't possibly be true because no one else has ever had that happen before.  I researched the heck out of that drug and it was pretty black and white what I was going through.  She was calling me a liar!!  ICING ON THE CAKE - she told me to take it again the following night!!  AND to call her immediately the next time it happened again.  Yeah right!  I'm not calling this lady in the middle of the night to be yelled at when I can't even call her in the middle of the day without being made to feel like some lowlife scum.    The following Monday she had apparently spoken to Dr. Grobe, who has always been very pleasant with me, and she recommended a new med that was just fine.  She was surprisingly nice which was very weird in of itself.    Overall, this place left a very sour taste in our mouths and I would never recommend this office to anyone.  My husband and I regret spending our money here.  If you want to waste a lot of money to feel like crap about yourself, Dr. Brass is the gal for you!
1 My daughters sought therapy through Don Nobis Progressive Physical Therapy after a car accident in January 2014. Staff is friendly but that's about the only good to this place. The place is understaffed and over crowded with patients. There were times by daughters would have to skip a step in their therapy session because the wait was horrendous.   They completed therapy in September 2014 but our attorney has yet to receive the final report from Don Nobis.  I've left several messages requesting a status update while our attorney has requested for one every 30 days as authorized by law.  I have yet to receive a phone call from any of his "friendly" staff.  We won't  go back and won't recommend this place to anyone.
5 I love this practice. I am relatively new to Cleveland and saw a few other doctors before landing here. I appreciate that they have so many specialists under their umbrella and in convenient west side locations. Making an appointment is always easy, and I haven't experienced long wait times to get in for an appointment.   A big plus for me is that there is a lab and x-ray facility in the same building. It's such a pain to run all over town for simple tests!
5 Dr. Sharma is a fantastic doctor.  He is knowledgeable and engaged when examining and consulting with you.  I genuinely liked him and hope to use him in the future.....look no further he is wonderful.
5 I recently got the Myers Cocktail at Dr. Mall's office for fever, fatigue, and muscle aching. I love getting the Myers for when I'm sick because it helps to speed up the healing process. Now, two days later, I feel so much better and ready to tackle my day. I recommend anyone to get a Myers cocktail for a quick pick me up!
5 Vianca and Chris (the owners/operators) are patient, helpful and great to chat with! Allure is extremely clean and well-maintained. An hour-long float helps to relieve my back pain, and I'm so relaxed after floating, I sleep like a baby that night! I float here at least once per month, sometimes using the couple's tank, sometimes using the single tank. It's a great experience every time!
5 First off, these guys are great.  Now that I've got a chance to say that, I'll tell you my story.  I was referred here after a lifting injury. Most places that I went prior were talking meds and/or surgery instead of "healing".  Dr. Hirst and Dr. Towner both took the time to examine my shoulder and chose a path of adjustment, massage, stretching, and exercises to fix me up. A short period of time later, my shoulder is back to 100% and my posture is better also.   Long story short, if you've suffered an injury or just want to feel better in your day to day,  I recommend this office a lot! The staff is great, and I always feel welcome when I walk in. Heck they even taught me a bunch of new stretches to do prior to my workouts.  Last but not least, they work with my insurance, which gives me peace of mind.  5 stars all the way!
1 This place is HORRIBLE.  I was sent here after a total hip replacement surgery which had complications afterward where I coded.  Harmon Hospital likes to come up with new diagnosis for patients so they can charge more.  They didn't give me my breathing treatments as prescribed. Pain medication took an act of god to get, but they had no problem shoving stool softener down you. The stupid fat little phlebotomist was hitting my hand so hard to try and get a vein that it was down right "patient abuse."  Its been over a week and my hand still hurts. Her response was "well do you want me to have to poke you again?" Stupid little young and dumb idiot.  They did have to get more blood. It feels like my hand is broken it hurts so bad.   Never mind I had a pic line for them to draw blood from. It  also STINKS SO BAD in there, THE FOOD TASTES LIKE THE PLACE STINKS.  I also fell in the bathroom really bad on my new hip that was replaced because they had a fake telemetry device attached to me and it tripped me. I undid the leads and this should have sent off alarms at the nurses station, 45 min later nothing from anyone.. My husband helped me get back up and I finally buzzed them to come to my room.  They asked me what I wanted? I told them I took all the leads off the telemetry device and they did nothing.  So much for the alleged close monitoring of my heart and lungs.  Nothing, no alarms went off at the nurses station.  Nothing happened.  I had been intubated for 6 days prior to going to this hell hole.  I left AMA and went to my primary care physician Son Bui, DO, who checked my blood cuz I'm supposed to be on blood thinners with a hip replacement.  He could not believe how low I was and this was the day after I left AMA from Harmon Hell Hospital.  I would NEVER EVER RECOMMEND ANYONE OR THEIR LOVED ONES GO TO THIS REHAB HELL HOLE. They didn't do the physical therapy for my hip either.  If I would have stayed there, I believe I would have died there.
1 ZERO STARS!  I will never go back to this doctor's office!!!  Integrative Family Medicine and Dr. Wachs is UNPROFESSIONAL, INCOMPETENT, AND DISORGANIZED.  I went to her office years ago and since then decided to return to her office when my regular doctor moved out of state; bad decision on my part.  Not only is this office disorganized with piles of paperwork and charts everywhere, but they also do not return anyone's calls related to diagnosis, test results, or billing inquiries / discrepancies!!!  I called this office for 3 months, about once a week, to resolve a billing code issue.  My insurance had denied a blood work lab code due to Dr. Wach's office coding the lab work incorrectly as a diagnostic code; however, it was not diagnostic as it was related to an existing medical condition that is covered by my insurance.  For two months no one returned ANY of my phone calls.  By the third month calling, I was told they had all new staff due to the same issues I was experiencing; at this point I refused call backs and insisted on waiting on hold anywhere from 8-15 minutes, until my concerns were addressed; I also faxed a letter to the office indicating in detail the issues I was trying to resolve.  The office NEVER resubmitted the correct coding to the lab company.  When I inquired again today and asked them to submit the correct code to the lab company, an agitated Dr. Wachs got on the phone and ranted about the amount of hours they have spent hours dealing with my billing issue, that the office doesn't have time to deal with this anymore because she has sick patients who need her attention, and advised me that I could pick up my lab coding.  I had to interrupt her childish rant to advise her my insurance and the lab company hadn't received the updated coding and I told her she was being irrational and she hung up on me.  WOW I'm sorry my medical condition and billing issues are too much for this doctor and staff to handle, but if they would have billed it correctly to begin with OR addressed this in a timely manner, their office wouldn't have had to spend any time rectifying this billing issue.  I worked for a dental office for years and am very familiar with insurance benefits, billing, and claims; I am also very respectful to people, no matter what the situation is, and I AM APPALLED that this woman felt the need to address me in the manner in which she did.  UNACCEPTABLE!!!
5 We are visiting from out of town and my son came down with bronchitis. I showed up 3 min before they were closing basically in a panic. They could have easily said they couldn't see him but they didn't. They were extremely nice and considerate to prolong their day when they didn't have to. Wonderful staff. Thank you.
5 Great Rolfer.  I've seen a few and she is definitely highly skilled.   Highly Recommended if your looking for a rolfer in Chicago area. Plus her location is totally cool and easily accessible.
4 I recently started going here due to my bum ankles.  I'm klutzy and carry way more weight then I should which has resulted in incredibly weak ankles.  This is one of the only places that is open Saturday's.  Yay!  I am really pleased with the staff.  Both desk staff and therapists are great.  I especially like my therapist Leanne.  She is just so sweet.  I am new to physical therapy, so it was a surprise to me that they book multiple patients at one time.  For instance I usually share my appointment with a lady who is going for back rehab.  Even with that you get good attention and I am making progress.  The only reason I did not give five stars is because of my first appointment.  I had a fill in therapist and she really didn't explain how things operated and I felt a bit of a hard sell on coming more than once a week.  And I get that is for my benefit, but there was no explanation of what my course of treatment would be and it felt a bit like chiropractors.....come as often as possible so we can bill insurance.  Ultimately my copy is too high for me to come twice a week and due to my schedule I struggle to make it once a week.
5 After a horrible experience with my daughter's old pediatrician, I was on the search to find a doctor that truly cared about his patience, took my insurance and would listen to my concerns. Dr.Le did that and SO much more!  My daughter has a fear of doctors and has also recently been tested to show she's autistic. She was sobbing in the beginning but left happy with a huge smile on her face! He listened to all my concerns, worked with her through the appointment so she was comfy and renewed my faith.   If you need a primary care doctor or pediatrician, I'd recommend him 100%!!!!
1 This Hospital/Rehabilitation is a absolutely the worst place I have ever been in my life. I came here following a knee replacement. The staff is lazy at best and negligent in some cases. My physical therapy consisted of walking a few steps then being put on a CPM (constant passive motion machine). That was it!  Not once did I see the inside of a Therapy Room. Did not even know there was one until a former employee told me there was one after I had been transfered at my request. .O.T Therapy was a rubber band they gave me and told me to stretch with my hands. Medications were constantly running out as no one re-ordered when they ran low. Worst of all it was filthy and I watched myself as they left used needles laying on food trays. This Hell Hole should be investigated and closed down. If you value the health and well being on your loved ones, Do your research!!! I researched my Surgeon before my Surgery but did not follow up on the Rehabilitation facilities. I would not send my worst enemy there. I blame the lack of care I received there as a part of the reason I cannot walk without a walker still after almost 3 months. THE CARE YOU RECEIVE AT A REHABILITAION CENTER IS AS IMPORTANT AS THE SURGERY.. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. READ EVERYTHING YOU CAN ABOUT HARMON HOSPITAL AND REHABILITAION. SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN.
4 My wife has been at Sante twice for healthcare issues.  Sante is clean, business oriented to patients and very helpful to the families of their 'guests'.  The dinning room is great and the food even better.
5 Physical therapy is not fun BUT this place is awesome!!!! :)  The staff from the receptionist to the actual physical therapist to their assistants are so friendly and helpful.    You can feel their genuine concern.  Since I have started coming here a few of the patrons have left after their physical therapy was over and you can see how much they are going to miss the staff here.    Ok...that was enough mushy stuff. Lol :)  Onto the actual nitty gritty.  :)  my physical therapist was Steve but I've also had Henry when my time did not match Steve's. Let me tell ya, no matter which one u get you are going to have someone that knows their stuff.    After every round of excercise that goes through motions your body should be able to do normally....Steve stretches out my shoulder.  Yeah it hurts but he doesn't push it past what your body can handle.  I'm very inquisitive and he had answered my questions without hesitation.  :)   I've been coming here for about a month now and I see a huge improvement in my shoulder.  I can move it better and my strength is slowly coming back.    Let's just say that I can't wait for my shoulder to heal BUT I will miss the staff here.  :) if I ever need physical therapy again I know where to go in heart beat. :)
1 Please do yourself a favor and stay away from this place, customer service sucks, the doctors are ok, but try reaching the doctor or particular office directly, you cant, then you are forced to call customer service and those people are terrible, they dont care about anything other than being rude...My doctor left and i was never noticed, they told me they sent out a letter, and i checked with others that saw the same doctor...they out-right lied about sending our notices and letter.  this place is the worse
4 My only complaint is that they won't refill a prescription over the phone. You have to make an appointment to see someone and pay a co-pay. Other than that, this place ROCKS. I see Maria Jaten, a nurse practitioner. She's the most amazing provider have ever had and I would rearrange my schedule to see her instead of getting right in with someone else.
1 Stay away from this drs. Office  my wife and i started going there since 2005 it was good for about 5 years  .  Are dr.conrad left to another medical facility and after that we kept getti g different drs and and it was a patient mill get us in and out charge our insurance  So one day my wife ask the dr why is her throat getting larger the dr said it was a thyroid problem probably  so he told her to eat bananas i thought that was weird so this went on for about 2 yrs so one my wife needed  the dr. To sign some papers for work they wanted money just to sign papers. I had it changed drs we go to touro university and the first thing the new dr said was to my wife i need to get your neck checked blood work the whole 9 yards , the dr was amazed that damily dr community did nothimg after all them years. My wife is know having surgery to remove the goiter that is wrapped around her aorta in her throat in both sides its going to be a major surgery this could have been caught earlier by dr.gulat and his crack team staff it would of been a minor ver minor surgery. ..
5 Boy am I sad I heard Erica left . She is going to be missed by me alot. Always took the time with me always was very nice. Good luck Erica where ever you go there's not going to be another doctor like you there.
4 I  was helped by a young lady named Donna. She did my vitals  and she  also took my blood for testing she was funny yet professional you guys need more people like her.  My dr is a real nice place. And I will return
5 I've been going to Dr. Reddy for about 5 years now if not longer. He is honest, caring and he promotes eastern medicine and other natural forms of taking care of yourself. He suggests taking vitamins and supplements which is rare for a doctor today. Dr. Reddy has been consistent with prescribing medicine that does work well for me with little to no side effects which just tells me that he listens and he really knows what's going on with my body. I appreciate my doctor so much especially with the rapid decline in hospitality in health care. All the doctors in the office are great so if you're looking for a new one, come here.
1 This is my first online review of anything. I am 26, and needed to establish a primary care dr for insurance purposes. I can't say enough about how unprofessional this office and medical staff is. My biggest complaint is the main phone line, for all 13 (or more) locations, where you have to wait on hold for at least 20min to speak to anyone. Today, for example, I was calling about a bill I received and had to call them 8 times in a 30min time frame because 3 of the calls were just disconnected (they answered and then hung up the line), 3 of which I was transferred to an answering machine that I did not need to do, and the other 2 I actually talked to someone but they couldn't give me any advice or help because their hands were tied. They use over 3 locations for different phone services.   Overall: -nurses are very unprofessional and unkind -dr's are not thinking through situations that could have potentially caused me serious harm -it is almost impossible to speak to anyone over the phone and the receptionist can only refer me to the main phone line answering service which is no help at all.   In summary, I will never be seeing these dr's again, and could have filed several medical lawsuits against them. Please do not go here.
1 I went to see Dr. Nakra about having bunion surgery. I wanted her to do the surgery but I came to find out from the surgery ops (that I requested) that her partner Dr. Nguyen actually performed the operation. She lied straight to my face when I asked her who did the surgery. The surgery was a complete botch. My foot will never be the same. Yes, my bunion is better than it was but now I have other issues with that foot that I didn't have BEFORE. It's been over three years since the surgery and I've had to deal with pain and discomfort during that time and will probably have to endure it for the rest of my life. Don't go to Dr. Nakra or Dr. Nguyen. They'll say and do anything to "cut" you and get the insurance money and they won't give a damn about you. I would choose zero star if that was an option.
1 Very sad... we had attended WFP before they went Boutique... then we left.  They tend to overbill in my opinion not checking if insurance will cover nor accepted negotiated rates.  Anytime I see 6-8 people at reception desk... it indicates a billing factory to me!  My daughter was never properly diagnosed and eventually ended up at Mayo Clinic who diagnosed a heart condition, cyclical vomiting, etc. Also, they did not diagnose a condition and after 2 procedures with plastic surgeon and then the only specialist in AZ for the condition, she had procedure to fix the issue.  The "instructions" given border on malpractice and made the condition so much worse.  I've found most practices that have their own labs, surgical centers,  and x-rays, etc tend to "feel" like it's about the money not me.  I recently gave them another chance and they wouldn't bill my insurance and were more interested in selling me their supplements.   I've noticed that a lot of dr's are selling supplements now my gyno, urologist, and dentist do as well as selling botox :(
5 1st timer today, due to back pain and a referral from a colleague known as Afro-Jo there. Excellent service and better customer service. I had some pulsating machine work done, X-rays and an adjustment done. I'll be back in tomorrow and will continue to update this review. Stay tuned!
5 Dr. Luca made my first experience with acupuncture so pleasant!!! He is so nice and knowledgeable and really willing to talk about what he's doing and why. 10/10 would recommend to a friend.
1 I have to say I am very saddened and disturbed by how people like this can call themselves doctors. I have dealt with my pain for over 10 years now and I pretty much know what my issue is.  I have seen this doctor a total of 3 times. Today was the last. I seriously went home a cried. My first visit with this doctor I gave him the benefit of the doubt. I thought maybe this one is different and read all the issues I had on the ppw I filled out. The reason I thought this was because he came in the room and went on and on about himself and asked nothing of me. he said he had some injections that he could do that my insurance company would cover with approval which should do the trick for me and that was it. He spoke very quickly and was out of the room within less then 5 mins.  Second visit the doctor was way over booked. you could see that there was way too many patients for him to handle. I waited for a long while and finally one of his medical assistants came in and she wanted to know if I wanted to talk to the doc about whether or not I should received the injections without having an mri done yet. So of course I said yes. Next thing I know doc rushed in to stick me with needles and rambled quickly about having 60 patients to see within the next 2 hours.  3rd visit I waited for 1 hour before the doctor finally popped his head into the room and says I have way too much going on, follow me lets get you outta here and get your refills. I did try to voice my concerns to him being that this was my 3rd visit and none of my concerns or issues were addressed. With every syllable this doctor inched away from me as if he didn t care or have the time of day to truly treat me and my medical issues. I got all but 3 sentences in and he basically blew me off telling me he had too much going on.   I now realize this doctor will diagnose you not by his medical opinion or medical experience. I mean how can he if he wont even examine you or listen to what your issues are (Remember I said I was dealing with my issue for 10 years I've been to many different docs in other states and I know exactly what is wrong with me) This doctor diagnoses you based on what you insurance company will cover. I got a procedure done from this doctor that I did not need and did not help my situation at all because that s all he could milk from them. I gave this doctor 3 visits. Most would have walked away from the 1st. That s what I get for giving this doctor the benefit of the doubt. I should ve never came back after this doctor told me he had 60 pain patients to see all in the span of 2 hours. that should have told me everything I needed to know about the quality of a human being this guy is.
3 Um..what happened?!  I never really have had to wait for my appointments but the last two times the doctor was running late. Today was an appointment which was rescheduled from a previous day. That previous day, the wait was an hour long. At least I was told up front but I really wish they would have called so I didn't drive up there for nothing. I couldn't wait for an hour (and you know it would have been longer) with my three kids in a waiting room that was packed.  Well I was at the office today for an hour and a half. I didn't even see the doc, I saw the nurse, which I was fine with since they were just well checks. I really hope this is not going to be a common occurrence, otherwise I will be looking for a new doctor for my kids.
5 I have had a few different injuries over the last few years unfortunately, but Jesse and the rest of the PTs at Exos do such a wonderful job.  You never feel like just a number, or that the  PT is just gonna rush to get to the next patient. You are with the actual PT most of the time, not some tech.   The level of care and detail is the best I've found. If you have suffered an injury and want to get back to 100% I highly recommend.
5 Absolutely have an amazing doctor!!! He is like a small town doctor in a big city. He takes time to listen to you and goes beyond the call of duty. I am so thankful I was able to get into his practice. Dr. Ross is the most caring doctor I have ever met!!!
1 The massage therapist didn't do a good job and only worked on one part of shoulders the ENTIRE time. It was my first massage and I told others about my experience and they said that I got ripped off. I wanted to be helped on my entire back. Not just my shoulder.
1 People with money generally have it because they do not waste it. $130+ a month (for 1-year signup factoring in initiation fee) for a membership at this place is laughable. Yes, that's right, $130+/mo for a gym membership. There is absolutely nothing at this facility that would make me contemplate that type of membership cost. They are not even open 24 hours. They are not even open before 6am? Don't you think people with the means to consider paying your ridiculous membership rates have busy careers and would need flexible gym hours?? The whole membership age-related scale is also extremely offensive. Under 30 you pay one price, 30-34 another, over 35+ yet another price.In my opinion this amounts to age discrimination. But I could put up with all of that if I actually thought it was worth it, but for this price no sane person would cough up $130+/mo for a pretty looking gym when there are comparable options in the area.
4 We use SNOHC for our business to complete TB testing as we work in hospitals.  They are timely and efficient.  I would recommend for your business to use for drug screening, hospital testing, etc.....  Michelle C.
5 This is a great pediatrician's office!  All of the staff are very nice and caring.    You get in and out very quick!  There are separate entrances and waiting rooms for sick and well children.  The toys and waiting areas are immaculate!    I cannot say enough good things about Dr. Vu!  Amazing rapport with kids and he listens.  You don't feel rushed or stupid for asking all those questions.  He is warm and caring and has a very gentle way about him.    I am so glad I transfered from another pediatrician's office in Henderson.  You will not be disappointed by this place!
5 I am so thankful for the Dr Kelly! I love going in and having my treatments done. He is an amazing chiropractor and has a kick ass bedside manner. From the moment you walk in you have a feeling that this is a place that people enjoy working at. Which then translates in a better client experience. They also have RMT's on staff and Randy is fabulous!
4 First thing first, this is one of those massage services within a chiropractor's office....don't know if that matters to you, it didn't to me. It's in a good setup (right off the 101), easy to locate. It's in a big spacious office with good ambience-solid woodish color tones and has this overall breath of relaxing flowing through it. I was greeted by Kathleen who would be my masseuse and she seemed nice.  I will say this about the massage room, I thought there was too much light during the massage and I thought the area was a little cluttered. Albeit, the clutter was in the corner of the room - I still thought that this was a little sheepish. The massage itself was bona fide solid. She uses this 0 to 10 scale, with 7 being perfect and then adjusts her pressure on the number you give her - simple and brilliant. She worked on the whole body and did a good job on the gluteals, upper back and neck. And the best thing, there was no chit-chatty cathy. Straight business. I got to mellow to a good massage without having to answer a barrage of questions. If Kathleen was in Street Fighter, her finishing move would be the ear massage - that felt goooood.   This was a good massage. For the price, I will say the quality of manual skill and body rejuvenation I received was a great deal.
5 Amazing Physical Therapists and assistants! My main therapist, Jarrod Schechla, and his assistants have been extremely helpful in pushing me to get my strength back after my ACL reconstruction! The other PT's seem awesome as well. If you are in need of physical therapy and you are looking for a place that will help, push, support, and treat you with respect in a positive atmosphere then I highly recommend OrthoSport on Centennial Parkway!
5 Dr Jen is the best doctor I've ever had. I've been sick for a long time and I see her once a month. The staff is always super friendly and by far one of the best staff I've had the pleasure of encountering. The wait is never crazy either and it's always easy to get an appointment.
5 I was hesitant to try a chiropractor but due to my consistent back pain for 3 plus years I finally decided to try Goodyear Chiropractic since it is local and recommended by a coworker. I'm so happy I did! My back pain is almost completely gone, and I feel confident in the treatment plan that Dr. Legg has laid out for me. The staff knows me by name and all of the personal touches speak for themselves. Highly recommended!
1 Terrible care, no one comes when called and needed.  Never use this rehab center!  Takes forever to get anything done, eg;  meds, breathing treatments, etc....patient beware!
5 I highly recommend Ahwatukee Primary Care, even though doing so may make it harder for me to schedule an appointment there!   Dr. Patricia Dietzgen really listens to your concerns and works with you to find the best plan for your care.  Dr. Dietzgen always takes the time to know her patients and remembers them.  This is not always the case nowadays, when many practices use P.A.s and you rarely (if ever)  see the actual doctor.    She also recommends only the best, most thorough specialists outside her practice so you can be sure you are getting the kind of attention your situation requires.  Her husband, Dr. Mark DIetzgen, is a Naturopath and also works in the office.    Join Ahwatukee Primary Care with confidence.
5 Dr. Reed is an amazing doctor! I had been sick for 2 weeks and was getting married in 4 days, so I really needed a miracle! Dr. Reed was very caring and attentive, and he gave me different options for my treatment. It's now the day before my wedding and I am feeling almost 100% better! His staff is very caring and kind as well. I am so glad I finally found a great PCP!
2 PLEASE!!!!  Turn down or off..the adult baby sitter...the TV!!! The last thing sick people want to hear is the ever stupid n vapid noise coming a TV. If adults cant do without the boob tube in the waiting room....then go out and smoke em if you got them.....
2 Had Philip; I feel like I got my ass kicked! He put all of his body weight on me during the massage.  I wouldn't go  back but my friend fell asleep.
5 Thank you so much to all our friends at Rehab directives!We are so greatful to have found such a Careing, efficient and professional team!Finding  services for children  in Las Vegas can be quite the challenging, however the folks at rehab directives are so wonderful and really care for thier families!
1 We went in my husband and I to get our blood pressure and thyroid medicine.  We waited for about an hour with no one waiting in lobby.  When the doctor came in we talked to him and wanted our medicines refilled.  The doctor wasn't paying attention to what we need.  I had blood drawn and pee sample for my medicine. Well come to find out he didn't give me both of my medicine. Just gave me one when we told them they didn't give me all my medicine they looked it up and told me that we didn't talk to the doctor about our medicine refills. We would have to come in again for another visit and pay for a doctors visit. All they want is the money they don't care about you all they care about is the money.  Please everyone don't go to this place they are not good doctors or staff. Big mistake if you go they rip you off.
5 The Woolston Wellness Center has been very instrumental in making my life staying on course for total and complete wellness!!! I will be starting my 5th year of adjustments (twice a week) next month! When I started here it was for sciatic pain, neck problems, lower back aches!!! I work in Banquets carrying lots of weight up on my right shoulder!! I started walking lopsided due to pain! Little did I know that it was all fixable through chiropractic care!!!! AND in the crossfire, I suddenly realized I didn't take aspirin and or migraine medications for the extreme MIGRAINES I HAD MY ENTIRE LIFE!!!! Those are GONE and haven't had a headache for going on 5 years!!!! And come to think of it - I don't go to my medical doctor very often either!!! At my age of 59, I feel better because I always feel well!!! Thank you, Dr. Jeff, for making such an extraordinary difference In my life!
5 I was recommended to this place and Dr. Holland from another office. Dr. Holland is very nice to work with. He takes the time to explain, makes sure the patient understands everything and I was not treated like a number or a simple in and out patient. I've been very pleased of everything and how detail oriented he is. Overall great to work with him and his team.
5 I got a 2-hr float last night--it was the best session ever! I usually get 1 hr but decided to double it.   Epsom salt float helps with flushing lactic acid so it's perfect combination for me who goes to chiropractor! I was even to "crack" some bones while in there and it feels sooo good!   Make sure you calm yourself and "let go" especially when you're like me who don't know how to swim or float--you will float in epsom salt float no matter what. Plus, less panicky, less likely to get salt water in your eyes. Trust me, it hurts! Also, all the scratches or wounds you didn't know you have will hurt like hell too.. just suck it up for a few minutes and then you won't notice it anymore.  They have shampoo, conditioner, body wash, washcloth and towels, ear plugs, cotton tips, slippers, robe and lotion. If you have sensitive skin like me, bring your own especially washcloth. Their toiletries are not bad, I was able to use them without flaring up when I forgot to bring mine.  They also have snacks and water. Sometimes almonds, raisins and/or Welch's fruit snacks.  Chris and Viance--they make you feel like family. I know how to distinguish a good customer service because they want tips and a good customer service because they love what they're doing. They're the latter, and even more.   I wish for them to stay in business for a long time because I want to keep going there!
5 I've had low back pain off and (mostly) on for years and never had any luck with other therapists. During the first visit with Nick I noticed a significant improvement. He is currently helping with my neck pain along with continuing low back/hip issues. I wouldn't dream of going anywhere else! The staff is awesome and I look forward to my visits. Such a fun, family environment. I'm so appreciative and highly recommend Preferred Physical Therapy!!!
5 I have been going to physiotherapists for the last 2 years because I had cancer on my left leg. I had to change four physiotherapists before I found the  the right one.  Elite Physio is the best clinic I found.  People who work at the clinic are professional, efficient and kind. Marco is my physiotherapist - he is amazing.  I have been going to this clinic for the last 3 months and I saw results shortly after my first few visits.  And it is getting better - much better.  Marco knows his stuff well and he is dedicated and committed to help me heal and get better.  in addition, when I have to do exercises at home, if I don't remember everything that I have to do, he e-mails them to me, so that I do them properly. It does not get any better - this is it people. I have recommended this clinic to all my friends.  Filomena P
2 My son was a patient of Dr. Vu, and we did see Dr. King once when Vu was out of the office.  Both docs are very friendly, but from my experience, Dr Vu spent very little time with his patients.  The past 4 appointments we had, the wait was long 20-30 min each time.  What makes the visit even LONGER is that a medical student usually visits first, gives your child a full exam, and then you have to wait again for the real doc to visit. When Dr Vu does visit, it's lightning speed.  The med student spends WAY more time asking you questions than the real doc, which is disappointing.    Bad experience on our most recent visit, I went in thinking my 2 yr old son had croup, told that to the med student and Dr Vu.  Med student kind of believed me, Dr Vu told me it was just very bad allergies and to give him Children's Allegra.  2 nights later, I rush my son to Urgent Care at 3am (Goodnight Pediatrics, love them! A++++) and sure enough, my son had croup.    Won't be back to Anthem Pediatrics....
4 Being in a walmart is a plus because i literally did not have to wait at all!  The doctors are nice and sincere and take follow up visits and referrals very seriously!   Great place to be! thanks again!
5 the core institute in gilbert is the best Dr. office I have been to by far. I have been going to this office now for 2 years. the front office staff is so friendly. and always willing to go the extra mile for all the patient's in the office, if they need to call a cab or need help with doors etc.   I have seen 2 DR's at the core. Jeppesen and Collins. they are both great. Dr Jeppesen has done 2 surgeries on my ankle. I am so happy with his care. he is so friendly. I highly recommend him if you have foot or ankle pain.   next the pt dept is the best....they are all awesome!!!!!I  I have no idea why this location ever got bad reviews. everyone is so friendly and caring. the xray dept the DM guy chris is awesome. give them a try
5 Jeff Moyer and his team at Foothlls Sports Medicine PT helped me fully recover from back surgery.  I would not be where I am today without the precise, detailed, attention that the entire staff gave me with regards to proper recovery following the surgery.  I can't thank Jeff Moyer and the others enough and will be forever grateful for the Physical Therapy experience.
5 Marlena is an Amazing doctor.  She is very patient with my son. She has been so understanding and accommodating throughout a very difficult ordeal. Thank you Marlena...I'm so glad we were referred to you.
5 For the past couple of months i have been working with Blaine, Jared, Cody, and Lindsey for hip pain. I can't thank them enough to get me to the point where i can jog again! Everyone is beyond professional and knowledgeable. I recommend this place for anyone who is experiencing pain!!
5 A few things:   1.  I have a low tolerance for pain.   2.  When in pain I want empathy AND a science based approach to a remedy   3.  I want to be heard.  I want a clinician who makes me feel comfortable, asks meaningful questions and sincerely listens.     I got all of this ...and more ...with Dr. M and her staff.  On the mend and so grateful!!
4 Today Husband and I redeemed the group coupons I'd bought us as Christmas gifts last year.  It was my first ever massage, and his first visit to Zen.  Both of us were very impressed.  Husband had Lisa for a Swedish massage, and complimented that she was very responsive and attentive to his needs and problem areas.  I had a Hot Stone massage with Daryl which was positively delicious.  The setting was comfortable and relaxing (and lives up to the "Zen" name), and all of the staff we interacted with were very professional.  Both of us look forward to coming back in the future for a treat.
5 Dr. Docasar is the best! Although I have been seeing her for awhile, this was my first time at her new location (inside the Flawless building) and it's gorgeous! She has a great bedside manner, always super friendly and available for questions. No wait, I was in and out in 15 minutes for my last appointment! Highly recommend.
5 I started seeing Dr. Kanelos 3 years ago when our family of 4 moved to Charlotte. Finding a doctor for me is the worst and scariest part of moving.  It takes a special doctor who can gain my trust and respect and that's exactly what Dr. Kanelos has done. He's the kind of doctor that when you are scared and concerned as a parent can walk into the room and instantly make all your worry melt away.   He has the kindest demeanor especially with children. He doesn't just give me an answer but educates me and even gives me all the options that are available. He always makes a point to give his best recommendation but I appreciate that he makes me aware that there are other options when available. He has always respected my delayed vaccination schedule with both of my children and has provided his opinion and expertise as needed.   We have since moved 4 hours away and I still see him. That's right I drive 4 hours to see him with 2 small children because he is worth it to me. His medical assistant is sweet as can be and always calls me back same day when I have a question.   I have also seen Nurse Spratt a couple of times and thought she was amazing as well.  I did see another nurse who I was not crazy about but I informed the front desk and they were proactive to solve my issue and have noted that we do not see her.  I recognize that you aren't always going to love every one in a practice but I couldn't have asked them to handle my situation any better than they did.   Everyone knows insurance has become more confusing and difficult. They did stop taking certain insurance and have since added many back. However in the mean time they created a plan for patients who didn't have insurance that they accepted which is what my family opted for and I found it to be easy and great for my family.  They offer a lot of help if you have any insurance questions as I did and they made it easy for me to
1 They actually advertise "the quickest medical treatment in Arizona"really?! Been here 1 hour 20 mins are still waiting. There is literally no other patient back here and they are taking forever for no reason. The "receptionist" was sitting on the counter at the nurses station with 3 other nurses (cause there is not doctor) just talking and one guy on a computer! Really? I cannot believe they can have such an atrocious customer service! They don't deserve their 3 stars on yelp. Should be 1 star if that.
5 Let me just say that I moved across town to the Southwest area, yet I will drive ALL the way to the Northwest just to go to this practice. They are super friendly, efficient, on time, and professional! I highly recommend them... As long as I can keep the amazing service!
5 I have been a patient of Dr. Adams since I moved to Vegas about 5 years ago. She really is a good doctor and I feel that she deserves better than a 3.5 star rating.   I do agree with other yelpers about the negatives here. Yes, the wait time is long. Unless you are the first appointment of the day, be prepared to stay here for 2-3 hours. Annoying, I know. But at the same time, I understand why the wait is so long because she really does take the time to listen and address all of your concerns. She's definitely not like other doctors who only see you for 3 minutes then rush to see the next patient. Yes, majority of her staff is rude and unorganized, which is unfortunate. They don't even give you a courtesy call the day before to remind you of your appointment. I always have to call them to make sure I have the correct day and time, which is very inconvenient. However, I do like Carli, who has been working for Dr. Adams for a long time. She is the only one who is actually nice and friendly.   Hopefully her staff will consist of better people and customer service will improve over time. Its difficult to write reviews for doctors, but I have nothing but good things to say about Dr. Adams!
3 I love love love my doctor! She talks to you, listens and gives feedback. My complaint is that I have never ever gotten into my appointment anywhere close to my appointment time! I work and can't be gone so long from my office! Even when I've tried to be first appt in morning. I've waited and waited, then been told shes called and said she's running late. Every time I'm here I almost walk out. But it takes weeks to get an appointment. And I really like her so I keep coming back. I wish they would look at their scheduling procedures and just be a little more respectful, of their patients time.
4 I've had to use the walk in clinic a couple of times for various reasons and have always been impressed with the service I received here. The reception area is clean, I've never had to wait too long to be seen, and the doctors I have seen are always helpful. The location is very close to several pharmacies.   The star lost is for the washroom, which is only accessible by walking through the waiting room.   If the nurse requests a urine sample you need to:  - leave the examining room and walk back to the reception area - grab the key from the receptionist - walk through the waiting room to the washroom - pee in your cup - wash your hands (very important) - exit looking as nonchalantly as possible walking through the waiting room with your pee in a cup - give the key back to the receptionist - open the door and walk back to your examining room to give your cup to the nurse  They should really look at a washroom close to the examining rooms.
4 Was referred to this location by my favorite chiropractor (Dr. Miller - Miller Chiropractic) to get some pain meds when my back got out of whack! The place is nice, comfy chairs to sit in, your typical wait area. I am pretty sure my wait time may have seemed longer than it actually was, but I was in paid and when you are in pain waiting is agonizing.  When I thought I was going in to finally be seen, it was only to take my temp and blood pressure, get asked a few questions and then got sent back out into the lobby to wait once again to be called in. Everyone was super nice though. I was asked if I needed anything, a wheel chair, ice pack. I denied the wheel chair because although it was very difficult at the time to walk, I still wanted to feel some what in control of what was going on to me =P I gladly accepted the ice pack though. Doctor was very helpful and informative. They have a pharmacy onsite that will prescribe you all the meds you need at $15 a pop. Good for those that do not have insurance, but if you do have insurance it is probably best to ask them to write you out a script to get filled elsewhere for a bit less. Overall a good experience =)
5 I am always skeptical of YELP scores that are perfect 5's.  Really?  No one has EVER complained about this vendor?  So, I waited and waited, for months, to come up with some reason to give Dr. Nemanic something less than a 5 star rating.  I can't do it.  He's truly exceptional and terribly pain relieving!  (Although I guess he could get a lower rating for being too far from my house, but really, that's not fair and he's overcome that objection by being so awesome.)  A few months ago I was in a lot of pain. I called 2 other Chiropractors near to my home and explained the pain and my severe, nearly immobilizing, discomfort.  Much to my chagrin, they mentioned that they could schedule time for me 2-3 days, even a few weeks, out in their schedule. I couldn't believe it. I was nearly crying on the phone.  That led me to YELP and to Dr. Nemanic.  What happened on the phone with him was as remarkable as what happened in the office.  "Can I see you in 45 minutes?"  he said!  Yes, in less than an hour I was experiencing less pain that I had experienced in months...and just weeks before my summer tour of Utah and Iowa and Wisconsin, I was able to sleep through the night without waking up in tears.    Dr. Nemanic not only adjusted my back and neck to ensure a predictable and continued recovery, but he offered additional advice on other areas of intrigue (my legs not pointing forward, my lower back pain, my workout efforts, etc.) and encouraged me to move forward slowly but surely into a healthier status that I was before the fateful "fall" that brought me to his doorstep in the first place.    I highly recommend this Dr. no matter where you live in the valley...drive there, enjoy the experience, and don't forget to thank me and the other YELPers who have led you to this place of blissful painlessness.
5 I need to come back and give a more detailed review, but I wanted to leave this to start.   Key Points:  Bowen Therapy specialist for almost 10 years - and it shows! Every small movement had incredible affects on my body.   Gifted healer, working with hands for over two decades. Laura understands the human body; her intuitive knowledge is evidenced in her therapy methods.   Kind soul! Laura makes you feel very comfortable, giving you a feeling of trust almost instantly.   Knowledgeable in natural and homeopathic methods. Her ways go against the typical 'lifetime patient' ways of Western medicine. She includes tailored recommendations in her therapy session, and not in a sales-y way; it is clear she enjoys sharing knowledge, even if that means sending you to an outside store.  Hope this helps, I'll be back later to pretty this up!
1 This place deserves negative stars.  I want once in 2013 and waited an hour and half past my appointment time.  Second last fast forward to 2015.  I just received a bill for 15 bucks.  Now I know it's a small amount but seriously two and half years later you send a bill for 15 dollars.  The rude lady on the phone says she sent me a bill in April 2013. I say yeah and apparently I paid 15 dollars.  How is it my fault that a month after the appointment date you sent a bill for the wrong copay and now 2.5 years later you send a bill for the other 15.  I guess this place needs every penny because the service and treatment is pretty terrible. So glad I am out of vegas.
5 Had my foot pain the other day. Dr. D'Alessandro treated me. She actually listened to my concerns and answered all my questions. Not many doctors in this town listen to their patients, and mostly of them only care about patient volume instead of patient care. This young doctor seemed very knowledgeable, and I felt very comfortable. I give her 5 stars!
1 WORST place to go. I broke my bicep tendon a week ago, they sent me back home without giving me anything for my arm. I had to wait a week to get a MRI done. Then, they called me the same day of my appointment saying the doctor who was going to see me wasn't going to be able to help me because I had broken my tendon. Why would they schedule an appointment with someone who is not a surgeon if I was getting a MRI done to check if I had rupture ????? They told me I had to wait another week to be seen for a Doctor who then could schedule the appointment for my surgery. If you are thinking you are getting surgery in this place in a short period of time. DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE
5 I've been a regular with chiropractors and massage therapists (and a few physical therapists) for over 20 years. This is in the top 2% of all the above. I do not say that lightly.  They provided excellent services and the people are friendly and accommodating - not that I've had poor service at competitors but just need to point out these guys/gals are top of the charts.  My only regret is not finding them years sooner.
5 What a great place!  Professional / friendly staff, super convenient, and very affordable!  I live and work in the area and noticed that this place opened a short time ago.  I bookmarked it in my head because it looked like a small walk in doctor's office.  I woke up with a sore throat yesterday and decided the best thing for me to do was to go and see a doctor right away.  The last thing I want to do is make everyone around me at work sick.    I drove over there without an appointment and walked in.  When I walked in I told the man at the front desk that I wasn't feeling well and asked if I could be seen today and asked what the price would be.  He said he could get me in right away and the office visit cost was $39.  I had to double check with him that I was in a doctors office that could write me a prescription when he told me the cost of their office visit haha.  It's a family practice medical office that is ran by a nurse practitioner that does not accept insurance.    I met with the nurse practitioner and she diagnosed me with strep throat and wrote me a prescription.  She gave me the option of buying the antibiotics there for $20.00 or told me if I go to Costco that I could purchase the antibiotics for $8.00.  All in all each person I came in contact with there was very friendly, helpful, and professional.  I was in and out of there fast and easy and I was able to avoid giving everyone around me at work strep throat because I could get in to see a doctor right away.  Yay!
5 I have never been so satisfied with a primary care Doctor, till I began seeing Dr. Kimberly Adams. My husband, oldest daughter, and myself have been seeing Dr. Adams for a few years now, my husband went to other doctors, if it wasn't for Dr. Adams attention to details, my husband may not be here today. She is an amazing Doctor! Yes, expect to wait up to 3 hours to be seen, if you want a quality doctor, you will obviously have to wait, there is a reason for the long wait, it's because she ensures you are taken care of. The staff is friendly and caring, every office has a process and expectations that are set, there is a reason for the delays.
5 East Valley Physical Therapy and Aquatic Rehabilitation has an excellent post Physical Therapy program, called independent care. For nominal fee, you can continue your therapy program after you have graduated from PT.  In independent care, you are on your own to do the same type therapy as before. However, the Doctors and Technicians are more than eager to answer any questions or listen to any concerns one might have. This has been a great experience from the day I walked in the door.
1 If I could rate a zero star I would. The most horrible, rude and absolute waste of time.  I gave them 3 chances and trust me when I say I am very understanding. I get it that they are busy but the lack of compassion and push back you get just isn't worth the time or effort.  I have never had such a mind blowing experience as I did with this place.  2 different locations.  Thunderbird location rude !!!! The one on 19th Jesus what a hot mess.  After having been told to find a primary doc I got a call from a friend who made an appointment and said it was an ok place. Well I was just excited that someone took our medical. It's not from the government it's a private employer insurance. Went down 3 weeks ago to thunderbird location mind you I was early and my appointment was at 9am there was just 1 other person there. I realized I forgot my wallet. Asked the receptionist if I could just run home and get it (I live 10 mins away) was told nope need to cancel. (Um I know it was my fault but I've got a kidney infection) I asked if I could just come back and wait nope can't do that either. Asked when was the next open appointment not until the following week. Yah I may be dead from this so thanks but I'll look for another doc.  Went in the following Monday tried getting a walk in appointment the place was packed. The receptionist the same one as the first time says nope not today. Asked when's the next appointment not until 3 weeks. Ugh!! Went home defeated but later got a text from a friend it's behind 2 hrs (I chuckled) called and made an appointment for the 19th ave location. The person I spoke to seemed disinterested and a bit confused didn't really even ask for my medical info so I asked do you need that? How about the spelling of my name since you know it's like smith or brown? How about my phone number hmmm?? . But hey I didn't feel like spending another 4K at the ER like I did last time. so I made the appointment for Friday. Mind you it's Tuesday and now I'm dealing with this kidney thing for 3 weeks did I mention I'm diabetic? Well well well what you know. I went down early scrambled around the 3 different offices up and down the stairs.....not one of the 3 offices had me in their system as having an appointment. Wtf! I should have known better and to save a few bucks I allowed it to over shadow my gut feeling.  Did I mention they were rude and zero and I mean zero help what so ever! Receptionist stated they have over 30 doctors and not one of them Was I scheduled with hmmm so can you help a sistah out??  Not even an offer to help, not even an ounce of care given. Next week try for another week? Hahaha yah no I'm not waiting another darn week. Kick rocks! Went to nextcare urgent paid 75.00 for my co pay did my follow up there and now I'm on my way to have my peace of mind back.  Do not use this place. Do not waste your time unless you don't mind waiting and wondering when,where  and or if you'll be seen. Or if you even have an appointment. Pack a lunch and have your phones charged. Got places to go ? don't make plans on that day.
5 I came here on a Sunday. YES. A Sunday! There was a younger looking girl at the front desk with brown hair who was so nice (which is such a rarity) and everyone I spoke with seemed to listen to me and was really pleasant and helpful.   I was in and out with in 45 minutes, and I really waited almost no time to see a doctor. I got just what I needed, and I am already feeling better. If I ever get sick again, I'd pass up my general practitioner for this place- quick, friendly, efficient.
1 Do not count on them to do what they say they will do. Stay on them. Call your pharmacy to make sure that they call in prescriptions. They will tell you that they've done it and they have not. Many of the front office staff are not customer service trained. They are pretty unconcerned and you will have to call back and insist on getting what you need. This after they refuse blood pressure medicine to get you in to see the Dr. There is no email or call to remind you to come in for your annual check up before they cut off your prescriptions. They just refuse to refill and then once you make the appointment, they don't actually call it in. I thought they wanted my email address for a reason. My dentist sends me reminders. This medical group is really self serving. I am looking for a new Dr. I told Dr. Padilla when I first started going to her that I will not except these practices. Now it is time to put my money where my mouth is.
2 I would tend to agree with the previous reviewer.  Wendi, the new Physcians Assistant was very cold and standoffish.  I was a little Leary seeing the PA since I had previously had great experience with Dr. Allen.  The only reason I gave two stars was because my appointment time was very accurate and ultimately I got what I came for - a prescription for my cough.  From the minute the PA entered the room I wasn't even greeted with a handshake or hello how are you today?  It was just "So why are you here today?"  No smile, no upbeat spirit for people who are there for medical treatment, not even what is your name?  Just was basically a get in, get out and hope to never see you again.  She was asking me what I needed for my prescription and I'm like aren't you the professional?  For being in the medical profession I would hope Dr. Allen would find this behavior unacceptable.  I honestly felt so uncomfortable that I won't find myself coming back.  It's a real shame too, because I originally found them on Angie's List and now I found out Dr. Allen will only be seeing cash payments at another facility.  This practice is going down the tube real fast.
5 I have been going to cryotherapy for years it has helped my muscle recovery and eliminated any aches and pains. Angelo is very knowledgeable I highly recommend cryotherapy if you workout.
1 They rescheduled my wife's morning appointment, just to reschedule again .   My wife had a morning appointment at 9:45AM, and was told when we got there, that the doctor had an emergency and needed to reschedule for 4:30PM.   Neither time did they call and alert us, and we live 25 miles from his office. That's 100 miles and time off of work to be told twice that she needed to reschedule, in the same day.   My wife was then told to go to the ER or urgent care.   I quit going to him for a similar issue and it's time for her to move on.
4 I am a fan.  I'm a massage therapist and having someplace calm & welcoming and less expensive helps me take care of myself the way I ask my clients to.  I've had several (Wanda, Fabiola, Christine etc) and Jules S. is right you might have to figure out who works best for you.  I like a nice, Swedish massage with no deep tissue. (which I've had to re-iterate a few times).  Both houses are quiet so I don't mind either one.
5 I see Dr. Handeguand at the 35th ave and southern location. All I have to say is, if you're looking for an open minded, understanding, and fun doctor. Visit him!
5 As far as I am concerned, there is no better practice in all of Pittsburgh.  It makes no difference what your ailment is; you will leave this practice feeling worlds better than when you walked in.  We have NEVER been turned away and are seen within minutes of calling.  Once, I called from out of state as my daughter was in great pain and needed to attend class (Pitt Pharm school and you cannot miss).  Dr. Foltz too her immediately and saw to it that she was well that week.  I really love your entire staff and practice, what you stand for and what you believe as it relates to wellness and health.  Wishing you all the best of health as well, so that you can provide us with the best health!  Sincerely,  Victoria Vitullo Baker
5 I came here with my aunt and at first was a little dismayed at the condition of the building, elevator and rooms. All was good however in terms of affordability as going with someone else allowed for both of us to get a $20 discount. Also, the quality of both our massages were excellent, my aunt liked having her hips attended to while I had a great shoulder and back massage from Cassandra. I would highly recommend these RMTs and plan on going for at least 90 min next time!
1 I went to this clinic four years and eight months ago as an urgent care issue, turned out to be a dehydration issue.  I called before going and was told by the staff my insurance would cover the visit and I would only be responsible for the 5.00 copay.  Two months later I received a bill for almost 100.00, called and was told don't worry it was billed wrong to the insurance company.  Called, left messages and wrote letters about the issue many, many time.  To just this date did DR. Fersowsian/dba Ferdowsian Global Services, PLLC address the issue.  I was told by his staff Delhi that "they would write it off, but from now on I am responsible for any costs if I go there again"!! WOW!!! If the staff FOUR years and EIGHT months ago knew what they were doing this would have never been an issue because I would have not gone there,dah!!! HEY SUNSET CLINIC, AKA DR. FERSOWSIAN.  YOU MIGHT WANT TO WORK ON TRAINING YOUR STAFF, STARTING WITH THE PERSON ANSWERING THE PHONE TO YOUR BILLING DEPARTMENT......
3 Here begins my tale of foot woe. I will have to agree with all previous ER reviews for this hospital - it wasn't that great. But, according to the nurses and hospital staff, after being "bumped up" from the queue, my waiting time could have been a lot worse. And yes, I am sad to say, I had x-rays done in front of people who were in the waiting room before me. With no rhyme or reason, I will chalk it up to me being sooo great (sarcasm).   So, the brilliant girl I am, I decided to jump off a 10 foot wall. Because you know, that's how I roll. The immediate impact to my foot was...immediate. The closest hospital was SM's and I was taken to Emerg and arrived at 1-ish. The emerg is old. It looks like it came from a set of some 70's movie, and the usual, small, kind of smelly etc.... I knew I was in trouble because my issue (broken heel) would probably be anyone's last concern. Not really an emergency, but I still needed to get it checked.  There is a reception lady who asks what happens. Then, I am to check in with another reception lady who asks for address, health card information etc... By the way, if you do not have your health card, that can be retrieved. I found it really cool how connected the systems were. Then, I was to wait in the waiting room to be called.  I was able to watch the Spanish UEFA game while waiting and 2 hours later, I was shuffled into another waiting room to wait for x-rays. An hour later, I was shuffled into yet another waiting room to wait for x-rays. One hour later, a 3 minute x-ray was taken. After that, I was put in the same small waiting room to wait for CT scans to be taken. Meanwhile, I was watching the end of the Spanish soccer game, sitting beside a convict in chains who kept grinning at me (I reminded him of his girlfriend) and two police officers.  An hour later, I was taken to some ghost-town floor for CT scans and another hour, the doctor told me I had a broken foot. A temporary splinter was put on my foot and 45 minutes later, someone remembered to get my pair of crutches. This was of course after my boyfriend went to ask someone where my crutches were. The nurse apologized for forgetting me.  I left SM's emergency at 8:45 in the night - 7 hours and change after admission. All for a fracture in the heel. I WILL NEVER JUMP OF WALLS AGAIN!
5 My Nana was in this facility recently, and our experience was excellent. We brought her in for rehab and she was progressing really well. The therapists were a blessing always there to encourage her to keep going. She ended up staying there for long term care as well since we liked the facility so much. The compassion and caring from the staff was on a level I would never expect. My nana unfortunately passed, but one of the nurses sat with her until her last breath allowing for our family to know someone was always with her. This facility truly cares for their residents and their families. I would highly recommend.
4 I have been a patient here for nine years, starting when they were in the old Gilbert Rd. office.  The new office is bigger and better.  What has stayed the same is that all the doctors and nurse practitioners provide me with the same great care.  It means a lot when you are afraid of needles and women's yearly exams, like me.  They have helped me come up with a plan to lower my LDL cholesterol naturally, as I didn't want to use prescription drugs to do it.  They are gentle with my yearly Well Woman exam.  When I'm sick, they get me in that day, or the next day if there's a better time available.  The patient portal they use is very helpful.  The office staff are very friendly and they remember me, even when it's been almost a year since my last visit.  The downside is that they can get busy, so wait times tend to be long.  Also, some of the doctors are very popular and you need to schedule an appointment a month or more in advance to get a specific person.  Aside from that, I would recommend this practice to anyone.
1 I wanted to take some time before posting this review because I wanted it to be based on facts and not emotion.  Now that about 2 weeks have past, I feel I can write it.  Never have I felt "scammed" when going to the doctor...until now.  I needed a new doctor and after reading the reviews on Dr. Cadaval I was happy I found one close to my house with such good reviews(I checked other sites besides Yelp, too).  I made my appointment for a new patient and annual exam.  When I went it, I waited almost an hour by the time I checked in and saw a doctor..."a" doctor...not Dr. Cadaval.  I figured maybe she was on vacation or personal day or something.  The doctor examining me(I use that term loosely) didn't really care to know much about me or my medical history.  She then asked if I had fasted so they could draw blood.  Well, since no one told me to fast, I did not.  As such, I was given a blood work request("Requested" by Dr. Cadaval) and told to return in two weeks.  When I returned, I saw the same doctor I saw the first time.  She handed me the lab report and said "here's the range of numbers you should be in and here's your numbers.  Your cholesterol is high.  You need to lose weight and exercise more and eat better."  Mind you, she asked nothing about my diet or exercise habits.  If she did, she might have found out I weigh 165lbs and have 17% bodyfat.  I do crossfit and am a vegetarian that doesn't eat wheat products.  What exactly would she suggest?  After leaving, I checked Yelp only to find out Dr. Cadaval does not even work at this office any longer and had left before my initial appointment.  Why didn't they bother to tell me that when I first made an appointment and why are they still ordering lab reports under Dr. Cadaval's name?  Needless to say, I will not be going back and am certain it is the worst money I ever spent on medical expenses.  Do yourself a favor...avoid this place.
5 It's really hard to find a chiropractor this good...  Truly a diamond in the rough!   I started visiting Dr Steve a few years ago, I was in constant neck and back pain, also suffering from headaches.  I also was on blood pressure medicine but I will get to that later...   I had visited several chiropractors before with average results, I never truly was in relief.  Once I stated visiting Dr Steve, I immediately understood that there is a difference between a good and a truly great chiropractor!  After a few visits to him, he suggested that my core muscles should be stronger to help my back remain in alignment.  I was also overweight and asked Steve if he would help me with a weight loss plan. He immediately put a plan into action to help me lose weight, now I am 63 pounds lighter, within my goal weight for my height and much more physically fit. To top it off,  I was able to stop taking the blood pressure medicine that I was on! My general physician went over my blood results and said I made huge improvements on cholesterol levels and my overall physical condition was excellent.  It's hard to think I started this path of improvement by visiting a chiropractor, but with Dr Steve he shows you that anything is possible!
5 I began going to Blankinship Physical Therapy in late December to help with a recent knee injury. I chose Blankinship due to a recommendation from my wife, who had seen them in 2015 to rehabilitate from a broken ankle. When I first started with them, I was still experiencing a lot of pain and swelling, and a lack of stability in my left knee. My assigned therapist was Craig Blankinship, although I did spend a lot of time with the other professionals on staff throughout my course of treatment.  After about the second week of PT, I began to notice a lessening of pain and swelling, and I could tell that the strength and stability of the knee was improving. I not only did the exercises recommended while at their facility, but also did them at home in between visits. In total, I made about 10 visits to Blankinship and have completed their program. I do not have any pain or significant limitations in my knee at this time, and I feel that the treatment I received from them is directly responsible for my rapid healing and improvement. I left there with a better understanding of what I can do to maintain the health of my knee(s), and a good program of exercises and stretches that I can continue on my own.  The staff of Blankinship is friendly, supportive, and demonstrate a high level of professionalism and competence at their jobs. I really appreciate their level of care and how welcome they made me feel during my visits.  I highly recommend Blankinship to anyone needing help with their physical therapy needs.
5 Look no further! Dr. Sharma is an extraordinarily kind and compassionate doctor. He never ceases to amaze me with the scope of his knowledge base. I have a lot of serious health issues and he has addressed all my concerns with the utmost compassion. His diversity and ability to address health concerns with expediency and professional-ism is unprecedented. He treats his patients with respect, and takes as much time as needed to resolve any issue that presents itself. You will not be disappointed.
3 Pros: the sequence is good - it's a set sequence, doable yet leaves a lot of space for your practice to grow. The location is excellent for me Plenty of amenities (2 showers in the women's bathroom, shampoo, lotion, etc.) A LOT of class times to fit almost anyone's schedule *Mostly* friendly & welcoming staff Great retail The most humid hot yoga I've ever done (invest in vinegar for your laundry if you plan on starting a practice here).  Cons: A bit pricey. I wish this studio had a better system for sanitation. A teacher brings out an ominous bucket & a swiffer/squeegee thing after class. It's kinda icky. I only practiced at the 5:30AM classes because of this... but even then, there were cloudy dried drops of mystery fluid on the mirrors & hair on the floor. But perhaps that's the price one pays for pursuing a hot practice. There are staged, sepia-toned family photos everywhere (I assume they're the owners?) Its a little much... Maybe its just me, but it seems like kind of an off-putting & bold act as a business owner.   This isn't necessarily the fault of the studio... but some students convey an attitude of "I'M A VERY IMPORTANT AND BEAUTIFUL YOGA PRACTITIONER". (Think: sweaty Regina George.) So... there's that. This could intimidate new yogis (maybe?)...  Also, in my last class, like 4 people were repeatedly blowing their nose into their towels in between asanas. For a room that hot & wet, I'll take as few mucuous membranes as possible.  All in all, I'd practice here again, but it's not my favorite...
5 When I saw the name of Luana's business on Yelp, I hoped for something more than the chain store/strip mall experiences I had had in the past.  What I got was far more than that.  No sudden overeager knot grinding here.  From the start Luana put me at ease.  Her caring and healing energy glows and flows through her.  I had a remarkable spiritual and emotional experience.  Something I hadn't expected. She was very supportive and reassuring.  She did some craniosacral therapy on me that opened my lungs more fully than I had experienced in many years.  Truly the best massage of my life.
4 I had twisted my ankle and visited Sharon-Anne for my first initial assessment and treatment for physiotherapy session. She was very professional, knowledgeable, thorough in explaining her approach with my treatment and made sure I was comfortable.  She prescribed some home exercises for me to do to help my healing process and strengthen my ankle. I would definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for a physiotherapist and especially Sharon-Anne for her professionalism, knowledge and making me comfortable.
5 I really love the people who work here, they're incredibly nice. Dr Steve is very talented at what he does and has helped me with a lot of back pain over the past year. I love that they have walk-in. So convenient.
1 My experience with the St. Michal's doctors, nurses and staff, has generally been very good. However, this review is of single experience, namely, of my visit to the Emergency Dept last Saturday.  The triage nurse was far from welcoming, in fact she was quite hostile and she practically hit my hand when I didn't remove it right away when she asked. The registration person ignored me for about five minutes, all the time looking at the computer screen. She could have acknowledged me by saying "Sorry, I will be with you in  a moment". The resident doctor was condescending and not that knowledgeable.  The staff addressed  patients by their first names, while the patients are expected to address them as Dr Scott or whatever. It is demeaning, undemocratic and archaic. This is the 21st century and the hierarchy established a hundred years ago should by now be done away with. Everybody,  patients and the staff should be addressed by their last names. This is a respectful way when  dealing with adults. Small children are addressed by their first names and their teachers by their last. And not always, sometimes children call their teachers by their first names. The hospital should look at these issues and address them.
4 I took my son here because I was told by a friend that they could help with foreign objects in eyes.  This meant a lot to me because the last time I took my son for this issue to an urgent care, they told me that they couldn't help me and sent me to the ER to be taken care of.  The people at this urgent care were very nice and treated my son very well.  The service was quick and when the doctor prescribed an antibiotic, they told me that they could fill it right there at the urgent care for me!  It was ready for me before I was done checking out!  This is such a awesome thing to do for people because taking a sick kid to a pharmacy after they already spent an hour or more at the doctor is never fun.  The only thing I didn't like was that the room I was in needed some repair.  The electrical outlet cover was completely missing from the wall in the room I was in.  I can't believe a medical facility would leave such an obvious hazard like that!
5 Celia helped me with my post-pregnancy woes! back pain and diastasis. She is very honest and warm. She is knowledgeable and caring. Very happy.
5 I've been treated by different chiropractic doctors and Dr. Steve is definitely, by far, the best and the most knowledgeable! He takes his time with the adjustment treatment and each time he analyzes the back/neck again to ensure that the best results are achieved. I've also taken my 12 yr old in for neck pain and the results were amazing! We highly recommend that you give him a try! You will not be disappointed! My neck, back and knee are very thankful!
4 There are two separate practices within the same building. So don't get confused between the two! I'm registered with Dr Tolley who are on the left hand side when you're facing the waiting room door.  The reception, doctors and nurses have always been great and I've never had too much trouble getting an appointment.     You can request to see the same doctor but I'm usually happy to see whichever doctor is available as I've only been in for fairly minor issues.    All the doctors have been friendly and have been good about listening to what I've had to say. The nurses are always relaxed and kind and good at making sure I'm comfortable.  No complaints at all.
2 Service is very mediocre .. The therapists are mostly back rubbing than anything else ... Not sure if it has something to do with the promo pricing where they put you on a monthly withdrawal plan for cheaper than anyone else and perhaps it leads the therapist not to work as hard... Either way as a customer it's sad because customers come with pains and issues and they leave with just a back rub ... They should seriously look at either not offering such deep discounts so that therapists are performing appropriately for all customers
5 Best physical therapy in Phoenix. Everyone working there is awesome an they know what they are doing. A big shout out to Eva and Felicia for being the best therapists and Jose and Andy for the best PT techs. The receptionist Mary is very quick and helpful
5 This Desert Valley Therapy ATI is the best. I had a very bad case of vertigo. I had a hard time in my balance and walking very slow and with a cane. I could not drive and had to have a friend take me to my appointments. I had 5 visits to this ATI and with a big help from Suzanne Ocariza PT DPT Clinic Director, she cured me of my vertigo. I could drive again and got my balance back. If you ever have vertigo, Suzanne is the therapist to see. She was so helpful and was trained to make your vertigo go away. She is the best. I would highly recommend Suzanne and this ATI to my family and friends. All their staff including the front desk are so helpful and caring. I now have my active life back because of Suzanne. Thank you Suzanne.
5 Highly recommended place!!!! The staff is extremely knowledgeable and they really take the time with their clients! Personally dealing with Ryan is an absolute pleasure. He is very patient and really takes the time to pinpoint the root cause of ones chronic pain. The acupuncture treatments are comparable to none. Absolutely amazing results with the skill and treatment Ryan has and is continuing to provide. The facility is extremely clean and inviting with all the state of the art equipment! Give Symmetry a try, I promise a  positive experience and you "feeling" better after your visit!
5 EVPT was great and helped me recover fully and quickly. I highly recommend this physical therapy practice!
1 Horrible place with such old equipment and careless rude people in it, better off finding a better place if you want to get better and keep your mind at peace...  The oc department doesn't care about your well-being or progress...They do care about their 5 minutes massage times to not go over even by 3 seconds which was the only thing they were sticklers about
5 The best that Vegas has to offer! This practice is not only good it is awesome! Dr. Yee and his entire staff go out of their way to make all their patients feel comfortable. They always take the time needed to insure that each patients medical needs are met. They all are so professional and wecoming. We have never had a long wait. Highly recommend this highly trained group of professionals.
4 I see Kylie at the Scottsdale location and she is Awesome!  She is very caring and really takes her time with you.  I have been on bioidentical troches for years and Kylie is very careful about my labs and keeping everything at the right level.  I have never waited more than 10 mins for my appts and always leave feeling good.
5 Great service from the whole staff. The best attention I have received from  a clinic. The wait time in the patient room was kind of long before  doctor Nori helped us, But when She came she was very attentive and knowledgeable, I felt like she really care for our health,   I will definitely reccomend Her to everyone and I will come back if I need medical attention ,    Great doctor
5 I've been going here for a few years now, and I always get a massage from Keja. I think she's amazing! I highly recommend going here. It is kind of pricy (especially for Keja and I think the owner), but if your insurance can cover it, I definitely recommend this place!
2 Book your appointment at your own risk!! The place is nice. But my experience wasn't very pleasant. After the deep massage i had a pain for the rest 4-5days. The lady from the head office agreed yes some pressure point might have been pressed but not settled, so i should be using the heat/cold pad (which i already was since 4 days) and then went on to say i cant offer any free massage or any discounts I would have to pay the full amount! I could have taken a paid massage as this is covered under my insurance , but really doesn't make sense to get a massage and be uncomfortable for another 4-5 days..
5 The staff is outstanding at Jackson. They take time with you and really care about your progress. They are all great to work with and make the process more enjoyable.
5 Big shout out for My Care Clinic!  I had the rare opportunity to visit,as I haven't been to any Dr's for 5 yrs, and was wowed at the excellent care and surroundings of this clinic!  My practicioner Mary was so thourough and genuine ....and I was also lucky no waiting.  The entire space and restroom is immaculate, and they even called to see how I was doing:)    Highly recommend this clinic!
5 Dr. George has been my primary for 5 years. Yes, it can get busy. It is well worth it. He focuses solely on you when he's with you. He now has Dr. Parker in the practice; and, I've heard great things about him. You will need to make your appt at least a month out. Once established as a patient, Dr. George is great at squeezing you in instead of referring you to urgent care. He's genuine. He's kind. He takes care of his patients.
5 Dr. Eldridge is compassionate and always encourages his patients to come in regardless of what may come up! Office staff is friendly and professional!! Thanks!!! -Molfetta's
1 Facility is new and clean.  That's all I can say that is positive.  Unless there is an advocate with you, NEVER, NEVER, NEVER allow yourself to be transferred here on a WEEKEND.  No doctor available to evaluate and prescribe pain management meds, no dispensary for meds anyway, no therapies actively done, FOOD is not only horrible, but no attention paid to clearly noted dietary restrictions.  Just imagine the horror of receiving foods loaded with gluten such as a hot dog, rolls, cake, bread etc, a patient somewhat disoriented, and the ensuing diarrhea!  Short staffed, or lazy untrained staff on weekends, no PAIN MANAGEMENT plan, no walker, no potty chair, made available for my sister after major joint replacement.    Have good rehab facilities become a thing of the past?
1 I understand being a walk-in they take you if they can and you have to wait, but in no way do I believe that waiting 3 hours for a doctor to see you for 10 mins is ok. I'm extremely disappointed in the lack of care they have for their patients. Leaving a sick person in a cold room for hours not only is wrong but also runs the risk of making them even more sick than when they came in. I don't write reviews but lucky for me I have had three hours of time to fill. Thank you for making this review extremely easy to write. I would rather stay sick than waist any more time at this ridiculous excuse for healthcare.
1 Now that Dr. Chad Campbell no longer with this group, i can say that i tried another doctor there and just not happy at all :( really bummed!!
1 What a scam! I did have an issue with my care but that can be chalked up to needing a specialist and that's now what this place provides. My largest issue with this practice is their billing guidelines. My first visit back in 2015 was on a Saturday when the office had POSTED hours for Saturdays. I was charged $50 for out-of-regular-office-hours-care despite there being new posted Saturday hours. In the early part of 2016 the issue was resolved by having the extra fee removed from my account. Now it's August of 2017 and they are back asking for the money. Mind you there was no communication between 2016 and now. I asked for a copy of my billing records and got no response the first time. The second request took almost 3 weeks to deliver. After verifying the requested amount is in fact the previous mentioned fee, I am going to pay it, but be weary they will surcharge you any chance they get.
5 Dr. Cohen is great. I generally only see her once per year for my physical but she spends a lot of time with me and has really helped me reach goals like quitting smoking and becoming physically fit. She takes the time to listen and she's very easy to talk to.
5 I've gained more leg flexibility and have less knee pain after just two sessions here compared to weeks of work at a physical therapist. Thanks!
5 Amazing therapy session with an amazing and very professional therapist ! Thank you so much Rotem ! I loved every minute !!
5 Always a beautiful experience  Atmosphere is serene and calming Dr Lee is one of the best Highly recommend
5 After trying two other massage therapists in the area, I finally found Adriana. She is friendly, but not overly chatty (I don't like to talk too much while I get massaged). The massage itself is just right, and she is very good about asking if more or less pressure is needed. Best massage I've ever had, and I've had many.   The building itself is clean and welcoming.
5 I had the pleasure of working with Dr.Rose Moeser from Absolutely Chiropractic for knee pain/ sprained MCL. She was generous with her time, and has continued to try multiple interventions until something works to alleviate the pain and get me back to my active ways. She worked her magic on my first visit and was so knowledgable and explained the purpose of everything she was performing on me as she was doing it so that we were both on the same page. I would highly recommend her to anyone - especially athletes as she seems to have a knack for that!
5 Having been to a few physical therapy places I can easily say this is the best.  It starts with the owner Doug.  These people are here to help you.  It is not fun or easy to go to physical therapy.  I have gone from stiff and sore to asking if my form is right on what once was a difficult stretch.  They are here to help you especially if you want to help yourself.  It is a team effort from the scheduling desk to the pt technicians and the physical therapists to get us motivated and back to better than we thought we could be.
5 So, this here genius ignored a knee injury / some functional deficits for over six years.   See my Orthopedic Clinic Association review, hooray dyskinetic chain and patella femoral malignment! http://www.yelp.com/biz/orthopedic-clinic-association-tempe#hrid:wm7FN8FkYeWy9SedrvAMHw   Had the opportunity to work with Dave Hogarth, the Clinic Director. Well, more like Dr. Cummings said, "See Dave and ONLY Dave. Your athletic career depends on it, missy. Do it for your own good, or your right leg will EXPLODE!"   Joking aside, very nice and knowledgeable guy.  Also, I forgive him for being an ANGELS fan!   A former Decathlete (Track & Field for everyone out there thinking 'whaaaat!?'), I appreciated his more in-depth knowledge of the hammer throw and its mechanics. Dave "gets it" and when he didn't, he asked thoughtful questions.  Effective and varied home program, never static, didn't get bored. Fusionetics Sports Science is a great platform for visual learners, because you can compare your form with the video demos.  While Dave was fun to work with . . . Just thinking about the manual therapy techniques he used on my knee / foot / ankle / hip makes me want to go hide in a corner somewhere. And the FAT stick of doom. *shudder*  Can't complain too much, because I haven't felt "injury pain" while throwing, walking upstairs,  deep squat in my clean + jerk, snatch, back + front squat in weeks. Plus some gains in range of motion; oh yeah!  What sets this place apart from their competitors? Giving patients a maintenance program upon discharge so they don't lose their gains. This is the first time I've had this happen, and I'm impressed!   Also, pleased to report that Dave turned me loose when things improved for me, and didn't attempt to capture more co-pays and sessions. Listen to your patients, PTs.   Everyone from the front desk crew to the techs to the AT's were always very helpful. Steve Arias and Mallarie Hanna were always fun to work and chat with.   Excellent customer service with a recent billing mistake.   Overall, very nice, no frills, "gets-the-job-done" facility. It's also nice that I was able to meet a nice variety of athletes from the community, not just a "runner's club" clinic.  I recommend Dave and Physiotherapy Associates Chandler for your rehabilitation needs, full stop.   Hopefully I won't have a reason to come back, but it's nice to know this resource is available on my journey the next three years!
5 My husband and I have been patients of Dr A. Katz for 14 years. He always treats us well, never makes us wait long to see him and listens. He has a good bedside manner and is extremely intelligent. We have always been pleased with his front office staff, RN's and NP's. Now that he's got a new location at Thompson Peak Parkway he is closer to our house. Dr Katz is just good people and a great doc.
5 WOW! Dr. Nemanic really helped me. I live an active lifestyle and was experiencing hip pain. I did not understand why this was happening and I was getting frustrated not getting any better. I went in to see him and he treated my problems with the utmost care. I felt instantly less pain after my first visit. Now I have no pain at all! Thanks for your attention to detail and care.
5 I really enjoy this clinic n staff. The are prompt when arriving. They answer all my questions. They do an awesome job. Great medical office!!!
5 The facility is beautiful. They are still pretty new so they can be short handed at times but almost every employee was amazing to my mom who was in after an accident. The food had good days and bad days but I would bring my mom snacks. The biggest pet peeve is with the actual therapy. Occupational and Physical consistently went against each other and there was never a set schedule which was frustrating for my mom. The techs were wonderful. Shout out to the 2 guy techs who worked with my mom the most. They were wonderful. I know 1 of their names was Kerry (sp?) He was the sweetest and always remembered my mom's drink. I don't remember the other guys name but there aren't many men there. Anyway if you have to go somewhere like this,  this place is amazing.
5 I absolutely LOVE Dr. Bakty and Linda her assistant office manager!!!  I had never been to a doctor that treated me like family until I started seeing Dr. Bakty. She is extremely knowledgable, understanding, gentle and truly cares about each of her patient's wellbeing. With other doctors I had always felt like I was just a copay and that they tried to spend the least amount of time with me possible, just to squeeze in another patient. I never felt like they had my best interest at heart and they certainly never took the time to listen to me. Dr. Bakty ALWAYS listens to all of my questions and answers each one thoughtfully. I talk a lot and ask tons of questions which I'm sure can be annoying at times, but she never seems to mind. She is extremely patient and it is quite obvious that she is passionate about what she does. I also loveeee the fact that she didn't just look at one aspect of my symptoms. She assessed everything from my physical state to my mental/emotional and spiritual states. Ever since I started seeing Dr. Bakty I have felt like a partner in my journey to wellness for the first time. I feel like I actually have a say in my treatment plan and am able to implement the information she gives me to make positive changes in my life. It is very empowering.  Linda is also amazing! She is super sweet and goes out of her way to make sure you as the patient are getting the best quality care and supplements. I have been struggling financially and she has made it work so that I am still able to receive treatment, God bless her. Every time I go in to the office she is extremely friendly and greets me with a big smile. Their phone line goes through a company cell phone and Linda makes it easy for me by texting. I work in a setting in which I can't step out and make phone calls, so by texting I am able to schedule appointments and such when it is convenient for me. She even checks in on me to see how I am doing! I bet you've NEVER heard of a doctor's office doing that!   Together they are a perfect duo and I couldn't ask for anything more in a physician or the front desk staff. I definitely plan to continue seeing Dr. Bakty for health maintenance even after my ailments have resolved. She is a vital asset to my health and general wellbeing. Do yourself a favor and trust your health with the skilled, professional and incredibly caring Naturopathic Essentials. :) I promise it will open your eyes and put you on the road to powerful natural healing.
5 I moved to AZ from another state and went to a doctor recommended by a co-worker.  In three years, I never saw the dude and he always had med students or some random PA take his appointments.  After they lost my medical records (25 years' worth), I threw a dart at the authorized doctor's list for my insurance company and ended up here.  I have never met my PCP and don't care to.  PA James Harris has been awesome for 15 years and I've never had an issue with billing, office staff, or scheduling.
5 I saw Dr Rosenstein for the 1st time.  He is very compassionate, ease of talking about my health issues, listens to what the patient needs and spent the time with me about my concerns with previous physician.
5 My Left Foot Children's Therapy has a great sense of community involvement. The office/center is nice, and they offer a wide variety of services-not just personal therapy, but special classes such as yoga and tae kwon do. Super cool. I feel like many places do not offer what this place does. They are also open 7 days a week, which is really convenient.
2 They do not take appointments for sick visits.  You have to do their "prompt care".  That really sucks.  They tell you about a hour wait and 3 hours later you still haven't been called back.  So basically there is a waiting room full of sick people.  Great for the well people who have appointments who are waiting.  My last visit was for a bad cough that wasn't going away.  The ladies at the front desk are super nice and friendly.  I don't know how they do it.  I couldn't handle dealing with sick, cranky people who have been waiting for hours.  One of the women brought me a cup of water because she heard me coughing.  I thought that was really nice.  When I finally got seen, I was given 3 prescriptions the most important being cough syrup.  They only do prescriptions electronically you cannot get a paper Rx.  I go to pick up my prescriptions and only 2 made it.  They have no record of the cough syrup so I call the doctors office and they say they will get it called in.  By the next day it is still not called in so I call the office again, they say it was sent the first time so I call CVS who assures me it was never received.   I call back to the office and they say they will send it over right away, by the time I get off work it still hasn't been sent so I go in person to try and get it taken care of.  They take my id and I wait for 20-30 min.  Finally they give me id back and say it has been sent to CVS and give them about a hour to fill it.  4 hours later and CVS still has not received anything.  I call the office for the last time (thankfully they are open late) pretty much begging them to please get me this cough syrup since it is the whole reason I waited for almost 4 hours the day before.  The woman I spoke to was very nice and finally got it called in for me.  Everyone I dealt with was super nice and friendly but the wait and Rx hassle is just not worth it.
1 AVOID AVOID AVOID!!! Seriously the most incompetent doctor's office I've ever had to deal with in my life. Absolutely terrible. They place you on hold forever and never get things done in a timely manner. You'll never see the doctor and only see assistants the whole time. Choose a different office and save yourself hours of wasted time and pain meds from having headaches due to the ridiculousness you'll have to go through.
5 Very good experience here! I'm from out of state and he saw me on short notice. He was very nice and thorough with my service.
4 I have been living in Toronto for two years now, and until stumbling upon Emkiro I couldn't find a family doctor who would answer my calls, lets alone take me as a patient. One call to Emkiro and I had found myself a warm, trustworthy family doctor (Dr. Sara Cook). I went to my initial appointment with Dr. Cook was was honest, open, warm, and has taken a pro-active approach to my health in the short time I've been seeing her. Not only does Emkiro have my medical health covered, I have also been seeing Dr. Sapna Siram as chiropractor and for medical acupuncture therapy. Dr. Siram is knowledgeable, friendly, genuinely passionate about her work, and has made solid strides in helping me with my neck and back.   The prices aren't cheap (and I don't have great coverage) but for a downtown family doctor who can almost always see you same-day, I'm more than willing to pay a premium for fantastic chiro care.   Strongly recommend if you're living or working in the downtown core.
5 Great Family Doctor for my mother and I . My mothers English isn't the best so we make our appts together and get our follow ups on test results. I help explain what is going on to her and orders test snd treatments , then we follow up when it's time for my checkups . He is genuinely concerned and wants to make sure every possible route is tested before we make a final diagnosis and med routine. He won't over write to many meds if not needled and as long as our health is in line be happy.   Thank You Dr Tsai and your lovely assistance . You live nearly 25 miles away from us but we Both lnow we are in the best hands
2 We am have visited this urgent care twice.first time I had no wait and the NP was great. I had pneumonia she gave meds and was out quickly. Overall had a great experience.   Why low rating is my husband went back and when they were busy, they gave poor care. He indicated he had high blood pressure and was light headed. They wouldn't even let him talk to a nurse, they sent him away saying he needed a ct scan and go to the ER! How would they know, they didn't even ask him anything about him symptoms. Basically they were busy and didn't want to help or take another patient.   Also, they don't have an actual doctor, both time only a NP was there. Super disappointed at the second visit. Thought we found a place with good service.
5 I've been battling some back pain over the past month or so. At the advice of my doctor, I sought out physical therapy.   A friend recommended I visit this clinic, and since they took my insurance, I made an appointment. My therapist is Traci.   I came in with a TON of pain throughout my back and shoulder. After my initial and very thorough consultation, Traci helped prepare a roadmap for my recovery so I can be normal again. Already, after one week of therapy (along with my homework exercises), I am noticing reduced pain, increased motion and I generally feel better.  I've been back a few times, and will need regular therapy, but I really think this clinic is THE best!  They do a lot of listening after asking you questions. The facility is very clean and modern. The rest of the staff is very friendly.  If you need physical therapy, you should definitely make an appointment. Traci rocks!
4 A very good medical practice. Gp's very attentive and patient care to a very high standard. Would recommend.
2 I purchased a package where you meet the doctor, have labs drawn, discuss diet, & receive phentermine to aid in appetite suppression in addition to a series of 8 weeks of B12/Lipodene injections. At first impression the receptionist don't appear to be happy in their position, the MA who weighs you is in a hurry and just weighs you, does the measurements, & only says "okay" when you verbalized an issue. When I met the doctor the first time she was very personable & friendly but I've been there weekly for a month & she doesn't even bother to lift her head to greet the patients. I paid about $200 & I've lost 9 lbs but I can't take the phentermine. The benefit is it keeps me accountable for my own weight loss but after I complete my course there I plan to go somewhere else. The shake mix prices are affordable & tasty (cinnamon roll is my favorite) but if you need that friendly, personable experience you should probably find another weight loss center.
1 Poor Communication. Poor Customer Service. Discussing patient details without regard for who is around.  Seems very disorganized. Misrepresentation of clinical staff. There are plenty of better options in the area
5 I love Dr. Bradley! I have been going to her for the past few years and could never think of changing. She is always cheerful ad happy and makes you feel comfortable in sometimes uncomfortable situations! She always provides you with additional information and printouts about the reason you came in to see her. She genuinely cares about her patients and it shows. My entire family goes to her and we all feel the same. We love Erin!
5 Unbelievable results! I can't thank these guys enough. They spend the appropriate amount of time with each patient to address their individual needs. I would highly recommend!
5 So so easy to book and appointment and they always take last minute clients. Such a soothing and relaxing atmosphere and I have not once had a bad experience there (have been going there steadily for the past couple of years). Highly recommend.
1 I'm from out of state visiting family and needed to be seen for my sinus pressure I had been experiencing all week. The front staff was neither abundantly helpful or neglectful, very average so no complaints. Different story when I got to the back. Dr. Ainsworth started looking in my ear and noticed I had a lot of built up wax. She starting digging around with what seemed like reckless disregard for the fact I was a human being, and scratched the hell out of my ear while trying to scrape out the wax. Immense pain was caused due to this which I made clear to her, she didn't stop or change her behavior. Her ability to miss the wax and hit my ear was actually quite remarkable. The rest of the visit was decent, but I couldn't get over the physically body shaking pain I was forced to endure.
5 Dr paul is amazing and can help you! He can treat your pain or any discomfort you have !
5 Drs. Lee, Wolf, and Komar work out of this North Scottsdale office and are consistently referred to as some of the top pain management/spine physicians in Arizona. They are very well educated, compassionate and take the time to understand your chief complaint and concerns. They have numerous options for your treatment plan before you have to resign yourself to the surgery table. They have non-surgical solutions for sports injuries, back/neck pain, herniated discs, joint pain, arthritis, work injuries, nerve injuries, carpal tunnel, and muscle/ligament injuries.  They do many diagnostic tests under one roof so that you don't have to make multiple trips to different building. They can do EMG, Ultrasound and X-Rays at this location. Some of the treatments they employ are Radiofrequency ablation, PRP, epidurals, botox, and acupuncture (yep, Dr. Lee is also certified in acupuncture).  The Drs. will go through all your choices and the risks/benefits of those decisions. They will explain to you how every procedure works and what to expect. They also work closely with many physical therapists around the valley and Dr. Lee will send you to the PT that fits your needs and personality.   One of the most telling signs if a person truly believes in a physician is whether or not you would send your mother or father to that doctor, and I would completely trust them in Dr. Lee's hands.  This office is easily accessible off the 101 and their offices are comfortable and upscale. The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. They also have offices in Glendale and Tempe that will meet your needs as well.
5 I love this place, as does my son! Dr. Robertson was amazing, very knowledgeable and so great with my son. Is did not think the wait was bad at all. The staff had excellent customer service. I am so happy we found a great new place for my son!
1 THIS PLACE IS AWFUL, UNORGANIZED AND NOT FRIENDLY. I went to this facility after I was in a car accident and received sub-par treatment. Additionally, after I ceased treatment, I was sent on a six month long nightmare battle with the billing department. I was sent to collections twice after personally paying bills, my med-pay satisfying bills, etc. I eventually had to physically go to the location and send a huge copy of bills/received payment, etc. to the collections agency. DO NOT TAKE YOUR BUSINESS TO THIS LOCATION UNLESS YOU ARE INTERESTED IN RISKING YOUR CREDIT AND SANITY.
1 I would like to give them more stars, really I would.  The therapist I had was fine. The problem I have with them is they are outrageously expensive and they don't tell you until you' do racked up 5 or 6 visits. I kept asking and they kept telling me it depended on my insurance. While I'm sure I have pretty bad insurance, I has no idea I would be paying between $85 and $200 to share my time with 3 other people. I think the therapist spent a total of 10 minutes with me personally. I have no idea what I'm paying for because nothing is itemized. If I had known it was going to be that expensive I would have gone elsewhere. I could have paid $50 for a month of visits instead of being charged $500 for 5. I' not even sure why the last one cost more than the others. I know why the first one did, but... $85 to be told, "okay, go do this, now do that..."  I've learned a very expensive lesson. Thank you so much for taking advantage of me and my ignorance about my new insurance.
5 Hands down the best urgent care I've ever been to. I went to Concentra a few weeks ago, and it didn't compare with East Valley Urgent Care.  The wait was short, doctors were friendly and knowledgable, and they give you any medicine you need right in the clinic (don't have to go to a pharmacy!).
1 STAY AWAY from this disorganized and callous place. I made a new patient appointment to see the podiatrist - Dr. Kuruvilla, 2 wks in advance. I was told that my appt is at 3PM. On the morning of my appointment, I received a rude call from Dr. K.'s office, alleging that he is leaving at 3PM today & the trashy receptionist asked if I can show up early, as if I don't have a busy life w/ work, graduate school, etc. I skipped lunch, in order to arrive at AOSM at 2:15pm (in addition to taking sick hours from work).  I printed the new patient paperwork from the emailed document & checked in, paid $100+ for deductible, and submitted completed new patient document. At 3:24pm, one of the front desk receptionist called me up & told me that Dr. Kuruvilla had to leave for an "emergency surgery;" therefore, he will not see me today!! What an umbrage for making me leave work early & waiting for over an hour, then telling me that I cannot be seen!! I am absolutely disgusted by AOSM!
5 I was really stunned how great my shoulder felt after being rolfed by Jill. I was skeptical of my friends evangelism about Rolfing, but it really does make you feel like a new person. I would give Jill Coyne 81 stars if I could.
5 When I attended my orientation on October 29th before my challenge started, I had no idea what I was getting myself into.  But I did know that I was ready to make a change in my life.  After a cancer scare back in August, I had been desperately seeking ways to get back in shape.  I was ready to give up and just let myself go, when I saw the post on Facebook, seeking challengers for the next class.  I took a chance and attended the interest session.  While I was there I went through a series of emotions, doubt and worry, and questioned myself on whether or not I could actually do this.  I talked to Kirk Huggins Rogers who assured me that I would be fine, and answered all the questions that I could think of.  My primary concern at the time was not having to get up early, but Kirk told me he would make me a morning person (which I now am; I have no difficulty getting up anymore).  But when you get that nervous feeling of the unknown that lets you know you're doing the right thing, you just take that risk. I got that feeling and made the decision to make a change.  Over this six weeks, I didn't really have ups and downs, just ups AND I lost 22.8 pounds.  The trainers WILL keep you motivated, and they WILL challenge you, but it is worth every effort. You get out what you put in, and as long as you FTDI you will be successful!!!!  Thank you SO much for everything and this life change!! I will forever be grateful!!
1 Don't go here my dr Shilpa Gujrathi told me I have kidney cancer and would need it removed next week!!!!  I told her I have great anxiety over this please give me something she said "NO" I will give you something for depression--I said I'm not depressed  WOW!    After seeing a specialist there is no concern of cancer at all I just have an abnormal shaped kidney!! The place is not very clean----just don't bother with this place!
5 This facility is very well run and staffed well. I'm always treated with respect. I've been seen several times and always leave happy
1 Do yourself a favor...stay away from "Doctor" Korcal. My first visit had blood work scheduled and once the results were in,  they called me and told me it was urgent the doctor see me. Turns out the urgency was because I was pre-diabetic and my cholesterol was borderline high. They weren't at all worried that my TSH level was almost non existent (TSH levels would affect everything else since it has to do with metabolism). My next visit was when I got Bell's Palsy...Korcal insisted it was Shingles masquerading as the Bell's Palsy. This is literally impossible and any layman that knows anything about Bell's  Palsy can tell you that. If a doctor can't tell the difference between Bell's Palsy and Shingles, he's not a very good doctor.
5 Mike is great, very professional and warm. My neck and back already feel much better after just a few visit. He also give me a few pointers and some excise for everyday that helps a lot, and can be easily done. Highly recommend.
5 I love this office! I went for my first Botox appointment two weeks ago and I'm so thrilled with my results! Janet Wildemuth was extremely knowledgeable, answered all of my questions, and was really thorough with explaining exactly how the Botox worked. My biggest concern (and my boyfriend's) was that I would look frozen, but it is over two weeks out, and not only is my forehead wrinkle free, but my face is not frozen! The shots didn't hurt at all and I started to notice the results within a couple days! Janet was also super conservative since it was my first time getting it which made me feel a lot more confident! I had zero bruising or swelling after, just a little bit of tenderness between the eyes. I keep talking all of my girlfriends into going to see her :) if you are considering Botox (especially as a preventative measure like me!!) I would highly recommend this office! The staff is incredible and really care about their patients!
5 Been to my doctor now four times this month. Everyone from the med assistants to the doctors are great and very professional loved all my visits here 5/5
5 All I have to say is "WOW"! :D  I had an accident in 2011 and suffered from neck pain ever since.  I heard of Max Health through a couple friends and decided to give it a try and I'm so glad I did.  I had a massage by Meagan and an adjustment by Dr. Lucas.  They both were so informative and explained everything in detail!  I will definitely return!  Look no further, you will not be disappointed.
1 If the Core Institute accepts appointments to see and physician but instead gives you a PA, go elsewhere. The difference in training is monumental. This is a practice that should stop immediately.
1 Took my one year old there had a high fever wanted about 30 minutes. They examined him said he had an ear infection . So today he woke up with a rash took him to his normal pediatrician was told he had no ear infection stop the antibiotics because he has rosieola. Our dr. Pretty much said those urgent cares just tell you that because you can't look into there ears as parents so if what my dr. Saying is true it's a big joke I will never go back to that place again not to mention there is no doctors there it's a bunch of people who just through antibiotics at people because they really have no clue
5 Friendly and experienced staff and doctors make this a very inviting place to go.  My chiropractor here is Kelly Robazza, he's very friendly and extremely knowledgeable in his field. I came here after my wife mentioned how amazing Kelly was in treating her pregnancy back pains--which Kelly does specialize in. I've been to about 5 chiropractors in my life, Kelly has to be the best.  Not only does he attack the problem, but he also tries to identify and address the underlying issue...in my case tight muscles pulling at my back. I would recommend to anyone to go to Kelly as their first stop for chiropractic needs.  Additionally, his services cost the same as anyone elses despite being located in the upscale beaches neighbourhood.
2 I got here at 7am for a physical, the "physical" area is only open 8-5 (a fact that was not shared on their website) so the 24 hour one is supposed to do them any other time, they lied. I waited over an hour for the other department to open, as multiple people who came in after me were seen first with no explanation or even apology.  While the waiting room is nice I did not want to sit there this long.  Once 8am got here they took 2 guys that came in literally 45 minutes after me first.  Service is not a high point here and if you come, bring a book or something because you will be here for hours.
1 I scheduled a deep tissue massage...so disappointing. What I received was an extremely inexperienced therapist that did not provide an even adequate massage. This by no means was deep tissue.  The music she played was jarring to the experience. I will not be back.
5 My family has been going to see Dr. White for a few years now. At first I chose Dr. White because of my insurance and his office was only a block from my home. After meeting him and his staff I was so happy that everyone was so nice, professional and accommodating. I was never left waiting for more than10 minutes once I've checked-in. Dr. White has also made excellent recommendations for specialty physicians. He recommended a wonderful Oncologist for my mom when she was diagnosed with Cancer.
5 I highly recommend megan. She is the best. I recently had a spinal fusion. Megan is professional and extremely knowledgeable. She  reduced the numbness and the pain that I experienced my surgery.  The office is very friendly and efficient. I have never experienced a billing issue. When it was necessary to reschedule my appointments the staff was very accommodating.  This is a great place to fix the broken place in your body.
1 Worst place to go. Last time I needed to go I called for an app and was kept an hold for almost 30 mins and at the end I had to give up because I was being place on hold without asking if it was ok. I wouldn't recommend this place at all to anyone. Staff is never friendly you always get treated like your health don't matter. If I could give a NEGATIVE million star.
2 I got my first massage ever here and I won't be going back. Walking in I came in 10 minutes early to fill out paper work and the front staff were really helpful but pushy about their membership even before I got my massage. My masseuse was good, very informative but he talked way too much. During massage you are supposed to follow the client's lead and when I stopped talking he would keep talking and while he talked he would stop massaging. If I was looking for a friend I would give this place 5 stars but since I was looking for a nice place to relax I'm giving Massage Envy two stars. If you are thinking of coming back for another massage at a decent price, you'll have to be under a contract and become a member which is unreasonable to me.
1 This place was listed through my insurance as a provider.  I called for an appointment and they were able to get me right in.  This was just a wellness exam but being a new patient I would have thought some discussion would have occurred about past medical conditions, family history, concerns.  Nope listened to my heart, lungs and poked on my stomach and told me what labs he could order for my yearly exam.  Less than 5 minutes was spent on my eval.  I have been a nurse for 16 years and have never seen anything of the sort.  I'll get my lab results and be taking them elsewhere if there is something wrong.  Don't waste you time or money at this hole.
5 I started seeing Dr. Nemanic to treat migraines, and he ended up fixing a 20 year old injury that I had given up on years ago.  I have been through many chiropractors over the years, and Dr. Nemanic is far and away the best and most effective doctor I have seen.  His knowledge and patience have been transformational for me, and I continue to feel better than I have in years after every visit.  Beyond the immediate fix, he has also taught me how to care for my injury so that I can continue to live pain free in the future. I am so grateful I found him, and highly recommend him!
5 I am athletic and push my body hard. And most of the time, I forget that I have scoliosis and throw my back out quite often. Dr. Badger sees to it that my back is always aligned and adjusted so I can keep doing the things I love to do. I finally found a chiropractor that I trust to take care of me. I like that he diagnoses you like a sports doctor would.
1 I was experiencing upper back pain that was interferring with my day to day activities.  I went to see Dr. Sutton hoping to get some relief that day. He yook xrays and told me he couldn't do any adjustments until he looked at the xrays the next day. He did offer to put the muscle stimulators on my back but that doesn't really help much.
2 I have attended Forte Practice about 4 years many great doctors have come and gone. For my experiences their front desk is horrible, you're waiting over 1hr and more no one addresses you to say sorry for your wait, nothing just rush you through your appointment.  Dr Joe was wonderful at the beginning of my visit. I don't see him anymore.  For a Family Practice I feel and others I know. Feel that we are just ATM and Credit Card junkies. Using our hard earned benefits for no quality service. 2 days ago the Dr.wrote me 6# prescription I left with 6# she wrote one that was over the counter, not the cough syrup with codeine I called to bring the Dr's attention the front desk told me she wasn't in get something over the counter. Or make another appointment  for what I went in initially.
5 I found Michael to be very knowledgeable and helpful for a recent ankle injury requiring therapy.   To advance my healing he also included exercises to do on my own. During the course of my therapy,  Michael also used therapeutic massage on those areas of tightness related my injury. He is a compassionate and caring therapist.
5 We have been seeing Doug for a few years now and I love this office. No over booking, friendly staff. Never had an issue with meds or appointments. Best drs in town
5 Awesome knowledge and Amazon doctors that know my disease and how to ease my discomfort! Dr Liu and Dr Kuruvilla rock! Jenn J is a great helpful and attentive ma! Thanks for the service!! New knee soon please n thanks!
5 Everyone in this company is very professional and knowledgeable they explain what's happening so you know how your body is healing and why you need to do the procedures they have you do. They always call you by name because they want to not because they have to I would recommend them to anyone and everyone. If you haven't heard of dry needling it is very therapeutic and I've been to three physical therapy companies and this was the only one that used it
5 Nice doctor. Good hours. Uses ultrasound and massage therapies. Helps me with my chronic glute pain. Doctor has helped me order X-Rays and MRI to uncover disc issues and help me work with a pain management center to get an SI joint injection that has helped with my chronic pain. Friendly staff. Easy to make and reschedule appointments if needed.
1 This clinic is in my office building. I made an appointment for next day. The day of the appointment, I received a call first thing to cancel - the doctor I was due to see had an emergency and they would have no doctor at the clinic that day. While I understand doctors having emergencies, a medical walk-in clinic is usually used for an immediate need, so is pretty useless not to have a physician on site. I was told they would call me back to re-schedule in the event I had not found another place. I received no call, so good thing I didn't wait for them.  First and last time I will attempt to use this clinic.
1 If you want a doctor that feels like a medical factory and you can put up with awful attitude, this is a practice for you. The staff is arrogant and useless. Switching !!!
5 Had an amazing massage with Erik and I get regular facials here. I have since referred both friends and family to this location, all of whom have wonderful things to say. Very clean and quiet, really friendly front desk staff and the owners are lovely people who pop in now and again. Highly recommend!
5 Had an awesome experience my first two visits with Dr. Josh! I felt like he wasn't just trying to set up a ton of visits just to make money but he was honest and let me know that I only needed a few visits and I'd be good! He was super honest and extremely knowledgeable. He's super down to earth and makes the appointment very fun as well talking about sports, personal life, and other interests. He also gave me some exercises to do on my own at home to help with the neck issues I've been having and I've already seen a huge improvement after just two visits! I will recommend them to anyone. And the pricing is very fair and in fact a lot cheaper than I thought!
3 I have been going to caremore for 5 years....  This past year I have been through 4 doctors. dr, Bertoli was the worse. I had prior back issues so a MRI of my whole back was needed. He refused to send me for a MRI.. Only a Xray.. Knowing I just had prior surgery on my Lumbar.. he had the gull to argue with me that a xray was needed.... Good thing my surgeon sent me for a MRI straight away I had 2 bulging discs in my neck ..  That FYI his Xray didn't show..  Also this Dr would keep his patients waiting sometimes more than a hour after their apt time. I wasnt sad to see Dr, Bertoli GONE...  The Maryland parkway facility is much better as for their staff the wait time is less.  now I am off to my 4th caremore Dr. wish me luck.. I couldn't even find the Dr's name on the internet,,  I dont know what to do anymore one more crappy dr, and I am out he door.
5 Our family has been seeing Dr. Perez for over two years now and he is truly a gifted physician. He's patient and thorough with the kids and they get so excited about picking a prize from the treasure box after they're appointment. He helped my husband figure out some complicated health issues he was having and has made a huge difference in treating several issues for me as well. If you're looking for a caring, compassionate, thorough and brilliant family care physician, I highly recommend Dr. Perez at DC Ranch Family Medicine.
1 this office refuses to call back customers to cancel dr appointments. i have called 6 timed today to get a ph call back to cancel. they refuse to call back so they can bill you. i did make sure i have a record of my ph calls to show i have called them. this is the worst office i have delt with ever. no one seems to have no manners to call their customers backs.
5 I have received excellent care from MD24 House Call.Since my first visit everyone has been Professional and knowledgeable.After my first visit I found out I had Stage 3 Kidney Disease.My PCP Dr. Hughes is an excellent doctor and I feel much better after getting closer to my weight loss goal and lowering my blood pressure.The Office Staff and all of the Techs have been great!I am very fortunate to have found MD24!
5 Dr. Kinel and his office are excellent medical providers. He always follows up on testing promptly and I when I forgot  to renew a prescription on a weekday, the pharmacy called him on a Saturday and he was there to approve it. When you are a patient of Dr. Kinel, you receive the best care possible and get the best service in town.
4 Seriously.... I like coming here for my regular checkups... Haven't had an issue so far but will update as time goes long. So far I have been vising since Feb for regular monthly checkups. (I just like to make sure I am in good health)  I was having issues with depression, ADHD, took him 3 months to iron it out. Now I am doing Great. Thanks Doc
5 I thought I clicked on the wrong business when I saw the reviews. This place is amazing.   I went in because a displaced a vertebrae and could barely even move. Within the week I was walking better and by the end of 2 weeks I was brand new.   I also broke my wrist a couple years back and have had wrist pain constantly ever since. Again, within 2 weeks, no pain.   These other reviews are irrational. They are not mind readers; if you have something you would like them to focus on, TELL THEM!  A personal shoutout to Dr. G, Kendra, and Pam for fixing me up when I thought I was on the verge of disability.
1 Going to have to go with other reviews I've seen here.  They need to change the name of this place to UMC Long Wait Rushed Care.  My wife and I waited 4 hours. Watched someone at the front desk joke about how someone was gonna be here a long time because they were at the end of the list.  A real lack of empathy and compassion here.  Finally got in and the Doctor Liu seemed like he was on some kind of gameshow where he needed to get 50 diagnosis' in a minute.  I doubt he even looked at what the nurse wrote up because he completely skipped over note about a possible hang nail we wanted looked at as well.  Find any alternative if possible.
1 One hour wait for an Urgent care?? Vegas doctors all suck. This is no exception. Coming from DC where we have the smartest people working in the important industries, this is insane. Simple things aren't simple. Getting a RX is impossible.  This place should be shut down. 8:20 am and already hour wait.  This west coast attitude towards people's health is absurd. I fly to Dc no lw for anything serious. Good luck to people who can't do that. Maybe UMC is good. Who knows anymore. Broken foot last month and to get any pain medicine, I had to act like I was asking for cocaine. Abusers and idiots have ruined things for the people who work and actually need assistance. Las Vegas is the worst I've ever seen. Lazy doctors
1 In my opinion, Dr. Darvez should really take a look at the practices that she instills and should consider each patient individually with the utmost of care. To be honest, I really liked the PA that was there last year. Unfortunately, she is no longer at this location. Dr. Darvez literally spent six minutes with me when I came in for an infection. She spent half of this time trying to discuss why I'm not on birth control. It's obvious she hasn't ever reviewed my files. Ugh!! She refused to give me a prescription for my infection until I I took an x-ray and said she would call me that evening with the results. Of course I had the x-ray taken right away. Thank goodness I didn't hold my breathe! The technician even stated that I my doctor should have prescribed me something for an infection. I never received a call back despite leaving messages with the secretary. Communication is horrible, both with patients and other medial facilities. I wasn't impressed at all by Dr. Darvez; It's too bad the other PA is no longer there.      Pros: 1) They can typically get you in on the same day; however, I'm not sure how much that matters if she doesn't listen anyway 2) The PA gave me a good referral for an endocrinologist (the endocrinologist's office had to call them three times to get my referral docs though) 3) You can get blood drawn at office if necessary 4) Office staff was kind
3 Went in with a respiratory infection that just wouldn't go away. I have asthma and it had gotten so bad that my asthma inhaler wasn't even helping me be able to get a full breath of air. The wait wasn't too long and most of the staff was nice but I was not a fan of the doctor who saw me at all. He completely dismissed everything I had to say and lectured me for ten minutes about how I was using my inhaler wrong. Look, I know you're probably tired of people coming in with chest colds this season but it takes a lot for me to go to the doctor and if I say something is wrong, I'd like to be taken seriously. Still though, I got the medicine I needed and I'm already feeling better so it wasn't a horrible experience overall, I just would have appreciated a little more compassion.
5 Today my wife had her knee operated on by Doctor Lutul Farrow. I have nothing but excellent things to say concerning this physician. My wife was involved in a serious motor cycle accident in July 2015 resulting in her knee to be severely injured.  Thankfully the Veterans Administration refered her to this wonderful doctor. The initial consultation he was attentive to her concerns. He showed compassion and answered her questions in a manner that was easy for both of us to understand. At the end of the consultation before he left, he asked both of us if there where any questions. At that point the nurse came in and gave her instruction concerning the upcoming appointnents. The staff in the reception area was,also very professional, while at the same time friendly and welcoming.  Today as we're driving to this facility they called to make sure we were on the way, and to make sure she was ok. Upon arrival the reception staff again greeted us both in a very nice manner as well making sure if,she had any concerns.  My wife's procedure was completed about 30 minutes ago, Dr. Farrow came and explained to me how well the procedure went. He showed me photo of what the knee looked like before the repair, and after the repair. The prognosis he indicated is excellent.  Dr. Farrow is not only an excellent surgeon, but also is very caring individual. As well as the staff.  At no time did anyone here ever dismiss our concerns whatsoever. They showed nothing but kindness and compassion.
5 This location is awesome, open on Sat & Sun for sick kiddies! Been coming here since 1999, cannot imagine going to any other Pediatrics office. Dr Duddy has always been the best! He never changed, 15 yrs and still the same caring & smart doctor for my kiddos! Love the staff, especially his MA Patty, she is such a wonderful nurse.
5 Had an amazing time doing a drug test here! Went in at 730 signed in with the helpful lady that always had a smile. Was soon fully checked in. Called in by another helpful young lady to the back and she made peeing in a cup more comfortable because we just talked throughout the paperwork instead of having awkward silence. Quick and easy out before 45 minutes. Overall such an amazing place amazing super clean, they provide water, individual coffee packs so you choose your own flavor, and snacks all for FREE! Definitely glad I did my drug test here would recommend and would return for future drug tests
1 Waited for over an hour only to be told they couldn't tell me how long it was going to take. The iPad kiosk they had me check into was putting me two hours out at first and it kept bumping up my time more and more the longer I waited. It was me and two others in the waiting room so I'm not sure why the long wait and why the wait time kept getting stretched out.  Meanwhile, the guy at the front desk didn't get off his phone the entire time I was there.  I ended up just walking out and dude at the front desk was still on his phone as I left. He almost couldn't be bothered when I asked for my insurance card and ID back so I could leave.  This place is a complete crap show and nothing but a joke. It seems like anything Banner Medical related is a complete joke.
1 Went here as a walk-in. I handed the lady at the front the forms she needed me to fill out and she told me there were two patients in line in front of me but wouldn't give me an estimate of how long it would take me to be seen. I waited in the lobby for more than 2 hours before the woman who was number #2 in the line of 3 patients snapped (understandibly) because she had been told that there was one person in front of her 3 hours earlier, she then left making me 2nd in line. At this point I decided to stay for another 10 minutes before leaving, as I had to be at work soon. They finally called me back and I informed the nurse that because I had waited so long, I needed to be out within the next 30 minutes. She told me that there were 2 patients in front of me (doesn't even make sense). I left immediately after this point. I can't imagine a more incompetent staff, and I had no idea places like this even existed. I now have to wait until next weekend to be seen for the worsening skin condition
2 This place is alright but nothing special, the facility is old and haggard, they are understaffed and they do not respond to the call lights.
5 Good Years Family Medicine has been my primary place of healthcare for quite some time now. I have been seeing Dr. A and Dr. Greg for over 10 years now. They are always very professional, friendly and very knowledgeable. The staff makes you feel like you're part of their family. The new office is super clean, well taken care of and makes you feel like you're at home. Always in awe of the professional service that I receive here - something one rarely sees now a days and I highly recommend seeing them. I will be seeing them for years to come. Thank you for making it hassle free to see a doctor!
5 I had the very best care from Desert Hand Therapy.  Camie, the Physical Therapist and Manager of the Scottsdale office, sets the tone for a totally pleasant experience. She, along with the other therapists, really puts forth the effort to provide a detailed therapy specific for individual needs.  Camie understood my desire to return to work and knew what was holding me back was the swelling that persisted in my wrist following my bicycle accident.  She skillfully manipulated my wrists which provided incredible increased range of motion and reduced swelling.  She constantly observes other patients and quickly makes changes to different exercises when one isn't effective, thus reducing the amount of time necessary for each session.  You will receive excellent physical therapy care at Desert Hand Therapy, professional timely communication with your physician for insurance and return-to-work documentation, and you'll appreciate the friendly greeting from Donna when you walk in the door!
5 My very first time seeing a chiropractor and I'm glad I came here! As soon as you walk through the door the atmosphere is nice and peaceful. The Christian atmosphere is delightful and I love it! Dr. Steve was amazing. He explained to me everything that would happen considering I'd never been to a chiropractor before and made sure I was comfortable. He was very thorough and made sure I felt fine before I left. I've never been to a chiropractor before, but I definitely will not see anyone else. I was satisfied leaving and my neck and back feels wonderful. I would definitely recommend this place for others. Thank you for such a great first experience!
5 They made my dad well again. The rooms are spacious. The staff is friendly and attentive. Food was ok. The physical therapy people were top notch! They had my 91 year old father in the pool and it helped so much! I would highly recommend Wellsprings.
4 I sat in the waiting room for three hours and watched a Packers playoff game while dude almost died of pneumonia in the back. Took an hour for him to be seen and almost two hours for treatment. Everyone else was in and out in a fraction of the time compared to my walking corpse though so he's a special case. Smelled super funny but you get used to it. TV reception ain't great--I believe they use a paper clip chain as an antenna? But hey they're open late and on Sundays so what can you do.
5 Great experience at the Calm. Super friendly staff, amazing customer service (Mike happily rebooked me after I made a scheduling error online), and incredible massage treatment.   The care I received from Krista was perfect. She was attentive to my pain points and really worked them out. She gave me some helpful stretches and advice to relieve some of my regular pain, and guided me with some of my posture issues. I regularly go for massages and have to say that this was probably the most therapeutic treatment I've ever received. I will definitely be coming back.  Facilities were clean and tidy, staff was professional, and overall a great experience. Would highly recommend!
1 Very horrible experience during our traumatic health scare.  My niece was having seizures but they let her go from the ER.  We were back few hours later because she continued to have seizures.  The children's hospital ER put my niece on a blood encrusted ER bed the second time we got here. Around midnight they finally admitted her to the hospital. Then they played musical rooms and switched her room 3 times.  My niece is sick with an infection and high fever and they don't employ kid friendly nurses.  The nurse couldn't handle my niece's crying and kept asking is she always this bad?  Why did she have to keep asking us that every time she had to check my niece's vital signs?  We brought books to donate but we had to throw them away because the books were not clean.  So you can put sick patients and dirty blood encrusted beds but the books are a health hazard?  I got kicked out to the family room and when I get there the room was littered with food rubbish from the previous people.  But again books are a health hazard when the hospital is filthy.  Some of the nurses were friendly but most of them treated us like dirt making comments about my niece being bad, and not even responding to requests for clean sheets and vomit bags.  We were cleaning the bed and just needed clean sheets and a gown and we had to change it,  not the nurses but it took us five times of asking before we got some of what we needed.  Next time, nurses,  just show us where everything is located so we don't have to bother you.
5 This facility is the best. It's like going to a reunion of friends every time I go.    The owners are there every day.  Ed and Amy the owners are very, very,very nice . Did I say very nice,    If you want personal attention and professional results then you gotta go here.   I'm from Texas to ..I didn't know anyone here. Now that I've met them, there staff and many others under there care. Can't say I have seen anyone more happy than me.
4 I have been to many thyroid doctors, including the world-famous Mayo clinic, and this office is one of the best.   I have been going there for about a year and have had very positive experiences with the staff and my individual treatment.  I recommend them to anyone with hormone issues.
5 I saw Dr MCConnell a few times over the last few months. She really listened to my ongoing health issues and helped me feel much better.  Not only am I sleeping better, my skin has cleared up dramatically. She's the type of Doctor you can trust and I highly recommend her to anyone who would like to find someone who can help you feel and look better.
1 Dr. Swaine and STAFF are the worst.  Please do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.  LAZY staff and extremely unresponsive and slow.  Did I mention LAZY, unresponsive and slow?!  By the way......they are lazy, unresponsive and slow just in case you missed it.  Google Dr. Swaine and decide for yourself.
5 I went today for my 1st time and I was very impressed with the clinic.  Everyone is very friendly and down to earth.  From the front office staff to the nurse/medical assistant to the doctor, they all were genuine.  I really liked that even the nurse / medical assistant who brought me back into the exam room and checked my vitals was very attentive and caring about what I was there for.  She asked questions like a doctor would, she didn't just take my B/P, temp and run off quickly.  She was genuinely concerned. Dr. Som was awesome, I've never ever met a doctor like her.  She took the time to listen to me as a person and a patient which I've never experienced from a doctor or other health care provider.  She was also genuinely concerned and took the time to understand what I was dealing with and was very attentive with helping find ways to deal with the problems I presented.  She took the most time with me that any doctor ever has.  Normally a doctor is in and out of the room in 5-10 minutes, Dr. Som sat with me for at least a half an hour, it was refreshing to have that sort of attention from a doctor.    I will most definitely return to AMC, they really did a great job and I would definitely recommend them if you are not insured and need inexpensive health care.
5 Best urgent care I've been to. Had a fight with my stairs and ended up messing my knee up pretty good. Shot up to urgent care to get some X-rays and turns out it wasn't broken, but did have to get the knee drained. The doctor was amazing. Had some issues maintaining consciousness from the pain, woke up to the doctor maintaining my airway, getting me fluids via IV and had me on oxygen immediately. My wife was terrified as she's never seen this happen first hand. As bad as it turned out, I am very thankful I was there, and extremely grateful for the care I was provided.   Not something I "want" to say about visiting an urgent care, but if/when I need to go again, that'll be my first stop!
5 I have been working with Dr. Matt and I appreciate all he has done for me and my knee pain. He always follows up when it's unexpected and has the best bedside manners. He and his partner, Dr. Alex have a growing practice and I recommend them highly.
5 I've been through 8 rounds of physical therapy now at several places for various issues. This is my 5th time going though shoulder therapy following my 3rd shoulder surgery so I have plenty to compare this place to. They're off the charts here and I can't compare them to anything I've experienced before.   I saw the difference on my first visit in that the physical therapist actually listened to me. No recovery is exactly like the next. They pay attention to the activities that I want to return to and focus my recovery and exercises around that.   The staff is awesome! It's a team approach here between the physical therapists, assistants and massage therapists. This isn't the typical PT program where you're there half an hour and spend 5 minutes with the therapist while they tell you what exercises and stretches to do at home.   They do it all in house from gentle care immediately after your surgery to putting you through the paces several times a week as you get stronger. There's no routine here, they keep you on you toes as you recover and I'm quite sure I'll come out the other side stronger than before I injured myself in the first place.   One of my problems is, at my age and after the things I've put my body through, I have other little issues creep up from a stiff back to pulled calf muscle. They don't blink an eye, but treat the little things while still focusing on my bigger issue, my post surgical shoulder recovery.   It's a fun atmosphere with lot's of great folks. It's motivating as well to see all the high level athletes training in the same environment.   Highly recommend!!
5 My wife bought me a massage from this place and it was best and most painful massage I ever had. I do crossfit 4-5/days a week and i'm constantly sore. After the 90 minute session, I felt so much looser and relaxed. All the knots in my muscles he smoothed out. If you are an athlete who needs to gets some muscles smoothed out, go see Scott.
5 I would like to thank Dr.Elena Garcia she is like an Angel staff very friendly and helpful.Altought she was busy She removed my skin tags today.I really appreciated and would  definitely recommend Calderon medical group.
1 For those of you who had the 3 decompression group on deal this was my experience:  The front desk receptionist was very helpful with scheduling and in person. however I could not say the same for rest of the operation.  First it became very clear that the group on deal was essentially a bait and switch. The deal sounds great with THREE decompression sessions, x-ray, and some miscellaneous items. However majority of the time it turns into the monetary value of the group on deal.  Your first appointment will go like this: you meet with one of the doctors and he implies that decompression sessions are used only if the doctor himself and "other doctors" who review your x-ray says you need one. It says in the fine print that if the business finds a decompression is not needed the deal translates into monetary value, which was $40 for me very convenient as their adjustment is also $40, which I'll get to later.  I only wanted a simple adjustment for my neck which I wanted on the first appointment but he said that's not how they do things and won't do any treatment until next time. He took two x-rays and did some stimulation which I couldn't help but laugh that they would actually advertise this sort of thing. So I went a whole week and came back a second time just so I didn't waste my group on deal.  Second time was all sales pitch, he put my x-rays on screen and told me I had a forward head issue pointing out the poster they had right in front of me (I'm guessing everyone has this issue) and told me it would take 12 sessions for them to fix it. AS SOON AS I made it aware that I did not want to spend more money than I had on the group on deal he literally walked out and got one of his staff to come in and do his sales pitch. At least he knows how to be efficient and with his time to maximize profit.  Second guy came in and he was friendlier, basically said with 12 sessions you're looking at light therapy $20 and adjustment $40 per session, which totals to $720. They wanted to charge me $360 a month for light therapy which is basically working out on your own with a trainer telling you what do do, and adjustment which literally took 15 seconds that I paid $40 for with my group on deal. I will say that the adjustment gave me temporary relief for the day but it literally took 15 seconds which he could've just done on the first day like I asked for.  In all this business practice is indicative of a company who only wants to maximize profit by prolonging your stay as much as possible without any genuine concern for your well-being. Be wary and find another place.
5 Now, before I start, I have to say this:  I have had PLENTY of less-than-positive experiences at this place.  That said, my most recent visit was so positive that I have to write a positive review instead!  If you are going to see a doc at this clinic, PLEASE have the sense to ask to be seen by PA "Joe".  He is new to the practice (as of mid-February 2012) and is a great addition to their team.  His level of care for his patients (or at least this patient) went above and beyond what most physicians, historically, have offered me and he spoke to me like an adult as opposed to an ignorant child.  I highly recommend his services and will certainly request him every time I am there!
1 A very scary practice. The doctor preformed a spinal procedure on me that made me very sick and consented me after the procedure, which is illegal. When I called the office the day after the procedure to report that I was getting sick, I had to leave a message. It took the office more than 3 and a half hours to call me back and by then I was in the emergency room because the symptoms were so severe.  When they did finally call me back they told me I was having a reaction to the sedation I had received. I did the procedure without sedation. Three days after this I had to be hospitalized due to uncontrollable vomiting. Finally, 3 and a half weeks after the.procedure someone from the procedural center made a follow up call to see how I was doing. Who calls 3 and a half weeks after a procedure to check on their patients? I have made my PCP aware of all this so that they are careful not to refer to this group again. There are plenty of reputable, skilled groups out there. This is not one of them so look elsewhere.
1 I had physical therapy today. Then I had an appointment for a follow up visit right after my PT. I've been waiting for over an hour. My scheduled appointment was 2:45pm. I finished early with my physical therapy so I've been in this room at least since 2:15pm!!!! As I'm writing this review, I still haven't been seen by a doctor. Don't worry I'm not hungry or anything.
5 Both my wife and I have been to Dr. Johnson at Ark Family Health. Not dealing with insurance has been dreamy, and Dr. Johnson worked to make it as inexpensive as possible for us. The best part has definitely been the access we've had to a doctor. A few text messages saved us the usual couple of weeks of appointments and waiting. We were both able to be seen when we needed, for as long as it took to actually discuss our health concerns. So refreshing!
2 My wife and I were patients for several years, until they dropped our insurance.  The doctors were Ok, nothing exceptional.  My issue in retrospect is that the office was always overcrowded, and we were treated like cattle.  You can't call and talk to a person without getting very lucky- you maneuver through a phone system and leave a voicemail, which may or may not be returned in a reasonable period of time.  We are now at a smaller practice with a caring doctor and a staff that is responsive.  You can do better than this office.
5 this pediatric is the best place I've ever took my kids an when coming to emergency calls same day they put you in right away. my son almost died an I called I was so scared I went there asap. they saw him right away and rushed him to the emergency and no wait. I was so relieved. dr. Robertson is the doc to ask for this place cares for your children like there own.
2 I had gone a few times for tennis elbow and received cortisone injection. The follow up appointment, the receptionist failed to tell me that there was construction and the main entrance had been relocated and there was no address outside. I ended up walking all the way to Bay St. and back looking for the address. I was 12 minutes late to see a Dr. Woollam and he refused to see me because I was late. Meanwhile, he could be seen from the waiting room, sitting playing on his computer doing nothing and I was told to rebook; for a guy who is sitting right there, idle. I have never gone back. What about my time and TTC tokens? used for nothing.
2 I found this place by going to Zoc Doc....I know, I know, shame on me for not checking Yelp first. Anyway, I didn't really get the family doctor feel from this place. It seems more of like a walk-in clinic than anything. I recently moved to Chandler and am searching for a new primary care physician. Sadly, this is not it.   The first issue I had was when the woman checking me in tried to charge me $35 for my co-pay instead of $20. When I questioned it she kept insisting that it was right, despite that my insurance card says $20. I immediately called my insurance company and also logged into my online account to show her that it was $20. She wound up voiding the $35 charge and running my card for $20. Pretty annoying! If they can't even read an insurance plan correctly, they're probably in the wrong business.  Next came the doctor. I'm not sure why I waited for 15 minutes when my doctor was sitting at the desk outside the door...but when she finally came in to look at me she did so with a puzzled and confused look on her face. I went there to get a mole checked as it was inflamed and red. She touched my neck with latex gloves (despite my latex allergy, which I noted on the form) and just wound up prescribing an anti-biotic, which I did not fill. Basically, all I wanted to know if it was cancerous or not.   This place is good if you're looking for a walk-in clinic that's open late...and if you're suffering from something common.
5 This guy... Dr Chris.. saved my life.  I used to think Chiropractors were quacks!  NOT any more. I went from chronic pain to NO pain.  I recommend you GO!!!!    Life is TOO short.. live better!
5 After many unsuccessful visits with a previous physiotherapist, I reluctantly booked an appointment with Orsi at Rebalance to help with my achilles tendonits.  I am so glad that I did.  I can't say enough about how happy I am with the results.  After 6 sessions, the pain I have suffered with for over a year is absolutely gone.  I can resume all the activities that I had to stop doing because of the pain.  Orsi was extremely friendly, knowledgeable, helpful and professional and I am so thankful to her for all she has done.  All the staff at Rebalance goes above and beyond and it doesn't go unnoticed!  I would highly recommend Rebalance Sports Medicine and Orsi Timar :)
2 Good doctor if you can get in to see her. Average wait time 1.5 hours. I had to change doctors due to time restraints. Staff scheduling appt. didn't seem to care that I had to move my charts to another facility due to doctors lack of availability and on time appointments. Oh well I guess if they can charge anyone's insurance what do we matter.
1 Waiting on Hold for almost 10 minutes just to try and get an appointment is not reasonable. The staff at this IMS location apparently must be overwhelmed and underpaid because they are not the friendliest people around.
1 If I believed in hell this would be it. They are the most disorganized and time wasting "urgent care" I have ever had to go to. If this wasn't my job making me come here I would definitely pick some place else.  I have currently been waiting going on 2 hours for a physical. Takes them forever to see people and the waiting room smells like an infection waiting to become airborne.
5 So I used to be a member to Planet Fitness and for the past year I've been a member to Eos Fitness. The daycare is awesome and the people that work there are nice. I have no complaints about this gym.
1 This review is a running commentary of my initial visit today (6/13/2016). I arrived 20 minutes early for my 3pm appointment with Dr Rogers, so I could fill out the required new patient paperwork. It is presently 3:45pm and I am still grumpily ensconced in the small waiting area for my appointment. So far, the only positive thing is the receptionist; she is very friendly and positive with everyone I have seen pass through the office (about 5 people so far).   At 3:49pm, my name is called and I walk with the medical assistant into an exam room. Ruth, the med assistant, takes my vitals and leaves, telling me the doctor will be with me shortly. A couple minutes later, Dr Rogers walks in. Honestly, I'm a little unimpressed because he does not look like he's in great shape....and yet he's supposed to be telling his patients how to be healthy. He's a nice enough guy and was receptive to my questions, but didn't offer any enlightening responses. My reasons for visiting included getting a pulmonary breath test to check for (exercise induced) asthma and to see if I may have food allergies that may be contributing to bloating. Dr Rogers sent me to another room for the breath test -- the assistant in this room was not very pleasant and I had to wonder if she enjoyed her job at all -- then Ruth the 1st med assistant drew some blood (icky).   I left the office at 4:30pm. I spent way more time waiting and doing paperwork than speaking with any one person. I like the location of the clinic because it is close to home, but one staff person could be a bit more "professionally pleasant" and appointments could be spaced out more so that patients aren't waiting for almost an hour. In the business world, being almost an hour late for a meeting is unacceptable. Why do we tolerate lateness when at the doctor's office?
1 Strengths: Kind; Thorough and Knowledgeable with current research; Compassionate; Will consult with specialists often; Truly wants to help. Weaknesses: Long waits for appointments - not Dr.'s fault, the problem is with the health system; Lacks time management skills - long waiting times in clinic; Bills  patients - for sick notes, immunization, diagnosis notes; etc.) ;disrespectful to patients' time - more than once I have scheduled an appointment, and upon arrival or after waiting for a couple of hours I was sent home because Dr. G. had a meeting; Needs to improve on diagnosis; Needs to improve on structuring recovery following diagnosis.
1 Called to make an appointment and without any word from the other person on the line I was immediately placed on hold. Was then left on hold for 10 minutes and then they hung up. Tried calling again, this time someone actually picked up and just said "please hold" just to be put on hold for another 10 minutes and then for them to hang up again. No call back. Unprofessional.
5 Everyone from the front desk, to nurses to clinicians have been wonderful. Fast, efficient, friendly. Couldn't ask for more! Sometimes I get it, folks get really sick and there may be short staff, but hey! This is a clinic, not a hotel.
5 Until this year, I had never been in a hospital more than a day.  When I woke up I found myself at Kindred Sahara I knew this was going to be long term.   My fiancé had researched local rehab hospitals and chose Kindred Sahara based on reviews and doctor's recommendations.  I was awakened after being down for 52 days and I began my (conscious) experience with my new home away from home. I can't say enough about the folks who work here.  "Culture of Caring" is not just a marketing slogan.  It's how the people here are each and every day.  Yes, it's very clean, the response time is excellent and the attention to detail is apparent but it's the people, the one's that care for you when you're most vulnerable, who are Kindred Sahara.    I want to thank everyone and hope I didn't miss any names. * Deborah * Angelita * Leah * Steven * Meron * Maddie G * Maddie V * Bebs * Jeremy * Debbie U * Orlando * Marilyn * Sheila * Allison * Josh * Terri * Marietta * Krizzy * Christy * Pene * Kellie * Nelita * Stacey * Cora * Efstratios * Kirston * Vivien * Oza * Anna * Jay * Ron * Royna * Excell * Scott Thank you for bringing me back to life.
5 Dr. Webber and his staff are amazing. I had such a good experience in the months I sought treatment. Dr. Webber is very laid back and explains everything thoroughly. He is easy to talk to and an overall great chiropractor. The office staff / front desk are very efficient in their duties. I highly recommend this place for chiropractic care.
5 I have been a patient over a year now at Apex Medical Center. I have nothing but good comments and high praises . I see Dr. Oruene who is an excellent Dr. very compassionate, great bed side manners. My pain has been managed very well since I been treated by Dr. Oruene. Highly recommended. Thank you!
5 I HEART JILL! :)  I would have done this years ago if...  1. I didn't think Rolfing was painful -- Well, it doesn't have to be! I feel like Jill has eyes in her hands that peer into your body to find the disconnects & ooglies, then lovingly & gently coax them back to where they should be!   2. It didn't cost so much -- Helloooo, how much have I spent on massages & chiropractors for their temporary relief!? Duhhh!! Once Jill helps your body's fascia remember where it belongs, it STAYS THERE, relieving long-existing & what felt like chronic issues!  3. I'd met Jill at a party! -- What a great person Jill is. Friendly, devoted, expressive, kind, professional, tolerant, focused, passionate and GREAT at what she does! Why wouldn't ANYONE go hang out with this amazing practitioner!?  Go See Jill Coyne! You'll feel a lot more comfortable in your own skin!
5 Dr. Boothe is a pretty awesome dude. I went to Dr. B for several months to address some nerve damage that was causing tingling down my arm. We found him and went to him initially because of his location... though he's more expensive than others. We loved his energy and personality and care. He was very intentional. He seemed to help with some of our pains. I stopped going to him, though, because of the cost and his limitations in regards to what he's able to offer. I look forward to him building his business and being able to offer more therapy to his patients and potentially offering a more affordable price.
5 Although I have just had my first visit, I can only say, what a relief.  For over a year, after an auto collision, I have had minor aches, pains, and migraines. I have had several Dr. Appts with a family physician. Well after reporting all symptons, and ekgs and xrays, I hear nothing is wrong. So I make excuses. Maybe its migraines and weight gain from hormones or I need a new bed so my back doesnt hurt. My hands go numb because I had them in the wrong position, my eyes blur cause I need glasses, my foot hurts because of weight gain. Ugh. Then they gave me a questionairre for bipolar disorder and I didnt go back! So that was it. Long story short, life lead me to Dr. Blanton. Im overwhelmed and delighted to know I am not bipolar, I am in fact not crazy. We found the answers. And relief has begun. Thank you
5 I have been a patient of Dr. Amy Sparks since 2004. My daughter, mother and grandmother were also her patients. She is a competent,  compassionate and caring physician. She is very knowledgeable and believes in educating her patients. I have never felt rushed or pushed. She has spent as much as 35 minutes listening to whatever concerns we had.  Admittedy, I see less of Dr. Sparks than I would like to, however I know that she has filled her office with equally competent, compassionate and caring physicians and staff. I know that she is with patients who may need more critical care than I. When I do see her, she never fails to greet me and inquire about me and my family.  Dr. Sparks was awesome with my Mother, who was a retired family physician, herself. I hope she will keep me as a patient for as long as I reside in Las Vegas.
5 OMGGGGGGG!!!!!!! I got in and out within an hour! Andddd I got a free prescription for CHECKING in on YELP!! Whoooo hoooo. What a steal.   This place is clean quick and has great customer service. The guy up front cleans the chairs in the waiting room when the customer leaves, Nicee! Two thumbs up.
5 I have had treatments from Rowena before and know her to be a well informed educator on MFR while taking an attitude of student when it comes to understanding the individual client needs. During my last trip to LV in October, I was pleasantly surprised to have an extremely profound treatment from Rowena and Rosemarie, her sister who is a licensed physical therapist.  They treated me together, and exchanged no words but I had the greatest release that night.  I saw familiar and old faces thru visions in various parts of my body during the treatment and awakened the intuitive self within.  I released and forgave, and even saw my ancestors in a vision towards the end of the session, as well as things to come.  I was left with a feeling of hope, looked lighter and younger and slept so well for the next few days.  Can't wait to return and continue the healing.  Alohaaa...
4 Fast, efficient and clean. Hands down the best walk-in clinic I've been to because I have never waited more than 20 minutes to be seen,  have gotten my urgent/"day of" medical needs met here, and have never wanted to hold my breath for fear for breathing in germs . And we all know, when we have to crawl out of bed to see an MD while we are off work sick with a high fever, last thing we want is to sit in a waiting room with so much sickness particles floating around you can practically see them with your naked eye!  One star off for their limited hours - luckily I can pop by during the day as I live closeby and have certain daytime hours free, but I imagine folks might run into trouble finding time to pop by. And truthfully, many of us turn to walk-ins for urgent issues we can't get in to see our family docs right away, right? So I sincerely do wish the hours could be expanded.  Docs that I've seen here all seem to be relatively new in their practice but I have not really run into problems. One time I was referred to ultrasound imaging nearby whose office had some complaints about the referral system and reception of Patient Networks but that still worked out in the end.  All in all, as a walk-in clinic, they are doing a great job.
5 Awesome experience! I have made this my regular place. Excellent customer service, very professional, clean, and relaxing experience! No hassle and exactly what you expect when booking your appointment!
2 Dr.Adams is great! Rest of office parley run. Long wait time, violations of patient privacy, loud staff!
5 Kristen has been my physical therapist here three times per week as I recover from a ruptured Achilles tendon caused by the antibiotics Cipro and Levaquin (both quinolones). The FDA has black box warnings that these types of antibiotics can cause tendon ruptures, but I was still shocked when it happened to me. After a month in an immobilization boot, my foot and ankle were stiff and weak. Kristen's program of stretches and exercises increased the flexibility and strength of both feet and ankles, so I was ready for the transition back to walking shoes with heel cups. She started slow, was patient, and adjusted treatment as needed.  The facility is clean, with ample rehab equipment, lobby, beds, parking, and friendly staff. Bonus--the always have fresh popcorn in the lobby for patients.
1 Met with orthopedic doctor today and my wife's collarbone is broken...he showed me the x-Ray, I could tell it was broken! Don't go here to Brown Family Medicine!
5 I just had the best massage (if you can call it that) by Carlos. The reason I say this is because he more or less did an hour and a half physical therapy session with me. His knowledge of anatomy and the bodies muscular structure is top notch. I work out 5-6 times a week so my body always needs deep tissue work and stretching to perform at its best. Having Carlos as a massage therapist guarantees that I'll continue to be able to push my body at the gym and be able to recover properly as well. The front desk receptionist was also very friendly and accommodating.
1 This is the second time I have been to this doctors office and I am unimpressed. Money grabbers all the way. No care for you as a person.  I went in today after calling for an appointment yesterday. I talked to the lady at the front desk and asked if they did quantiferon TB tests and she answered yes. She said I needed to make an appointment to ensure that they had the material there to perform the test and so I went in today to get it done. I paid my usual copay of $15 only to be weighed and have my BP taken to then wait in the room for thirty mins TO THEN be told that I need to go to lab Corp to get this done and that my insurance won't cover it. Fine. But the. I don't get my copay back? You guys didn't do anything and you lied to me when I called and asked about the test!  Extremely unpleased and will 100% never step foot in this doctors office again. I would highly recommend you take the time to find a different Family care office.
1 I would give it 0 stars but the computer won't let me.....  I was told it would take 3 hours when I checked in at 8pm. It's now 1am and they put me in an examination room 2 hours ago and suddenly two emergencies came in. I thought you where supposed to call 911 in an emergency and not come here!  I guess it's lucky they have the market cornered on DOT exams and drug screens because if they had competition no one would choose to come here and they would close for lack of business.  A short edit I have now been in the examination room for one hour and they even closed the door so they won't have to look at my pissed of face.  We sorely need a new DOT physical and drug screen place in Las Vegas until then this place will never change it's lack of service or get extra help to make wait times shorter.
5 My mole healed very quickly and I have no scar or anything!!! I'm so happy with this place that I am probably going back to get another mole removed. I attached pictures so you can see the before after
1 horrible treatment. they dont call them croakers for no reason. worthless doctors just like every doctor
5 Dr. Jones has been my doctor for about 6 years now (since 2008). I stumbled upon his office by chance (had just gotten insurance and moved to a new city!) and boy did I hit the jackpot. His office staff are incredibly friendly, knowledgable and sweet. (They  remember what I do, and ask about my daughter, joke around, etc).  As for Dr. Jones, he has always maintained a professional yet easy going bedside manner. We swap stories while he examines me, and he explains things clearly and succinctly.  I recommend him to everyone I know, and no one yet has had a complaint.  Jones makes going to the doctor enjoyable.
1 Terrible place . Said my issue wasn't an emergency that the Dr . (Dr. Banuelos) Would see a patient. Upfront lady (Tamara) was not caring nor worried about my needs. I don't recommend this place to anyone and I feel sorry for anyone who is seen here !!
1 This is the WORST doctors office I have ever been to! I have been a patient at TPC for over a year and boy can I tell you horrifying stories!! The staff doesn't care about you as a person, they have no regard for your time. I began as a patient at the Mesa office and the doctor (Dr. Tom) was so rude, had no bedside mannor and was very unpleasent to see.I found my blood preasure gets dangerously high just pulling into their parking lot. I made the decision to transfer to the Gilbert office. There Dr. Cooksy was awesome but I find the staff to be the issue. I once had an appointment at 1pm, I was called and advised the doctor was going on vacation and I had to come in early, at 11am. I agreed even though it now caused me to leave work 5 hours early instead of just 2. The doctor did not see me until 2pm - that's right 3 HOURS AFTER MY SCHEDULED APPOINTMENT TIME!!!! That's 3 additional hours of pay I missed out on just sitting there. Then at my last appointment I requested to see the actual doctor rather than a PA so I could get an actual plan in place rather than just here is your perscription. They moved my appointment and assured me it was booked with him. Today I showed up and guess what.... my appointment was NOT with the doctor and I AGAIN saw a PA. The office manager didn't seem to care as nothing was done to correct it. I was told I can come back in 2 weeks and pay another $50 co-pay just to chat with the doctor but then I'd have to come back again 2 weeks after that to get my scripts....? Does that make any sence? They screwed up but it costs me $50....? I have since called my primary doctor to get referred to another Pain Clinic, I feel dumb enough having delt with this for a year already. Be advised- you will regret going there.
4 I didn't read reviews before I went and I am glad I gave it a chance, we've been going here for about 6 months now and I haven't had one problem with the staff or the doctors. My kid loves Dr Culpepper she is such a nice lady and I am happy we found this place.
1 This is zero stars! Terrible customer service! They NEVER answer their phones, NEVER return messages! When I finally got in, the DR sent me home with a script for pain pills! I've been waiting for 6 weeks for a follow up appt. to no avail!! Beware Don't go there!!!!
1 Concentra "Urgent" Care... Boy, that's a hoot. Nothing is urgent here. This is one of those places where a patient could die in the waiting room and go entirely un-noticed. Everything moves at a snails pace But they keep insisting its busy. Everything takes an hours wait. You'd think they'd never done this before and were totally unprepared... Someone, just shoot me. 41/2 hours and counting. Finally leaving.... A combined total of 12 minutes with the doctor.. The girl at the checkout desk... Young and Cute, but unfortunately spent 20 minutes looking for a form to fill out. What a nightmare.
4 I was in desperate need to find a doctor in my area, and turned to my health insurance website and I have to say it was useless..... SO, I turned to Yelp!! I was hoping that my fellow Yelpers would have posted something great about a practice in my area, but I was sad to see that I didn't find to many reviews :(, so I turned to my friends (I turned to Yelp first cuz yelpers always speak the truth:)  A friend of mine recommended Nurse Practitioner , Carrie Smalley at Desert Bloom. So, I called in and spoke to the front desk girl. I did not catch her name, but she was WAY helpful. Told her my urgency and said she wouldn't be able to get me in that soon, BUT they did take walk-ins the following day. She gave me the walk-in times, and reminded me their were two teams that work their (not to sure whats thats about) and stated if I came in the morning that Carrie would be working that morning and it would be good possibility that I would get her. She advised me that the early the better, I got her drift!  I showed up the next morning before opening and was impressed to see the door already unlocked and 2 people waiting in the waiting room. I noticed the 2 sides of check-in, realizing the 2 teams. I walked-up to the desk and was greated. I stated I was a walk-in, the girl was like "ohh you called yesterday, I recognize your voice..." AWESOME! But damn me for not getting her name. She took my info (since I was new patient there) and within 30 mins was brought in. I waited a bit to see Carrie, but I assumed much since I was a walk-in (actually thought I be their much longer waiting). Carrie came in and tried to get some background info about me and we got down to the reason I was their....   Gotta say my friend was right and Carrie was great and easy to talk too. I am very glad I was able to get seen as well as find my new medical provider :)   My only issue would have been is when you check-out. The girl at the check-out was on the phone and completely ignored that I was looking right at her. Not even a hand gesture saying "1 sec," which I would have totally understood. Ackknowledgement is key in any customer service business, just a note. Other than that would totally recommend!
4 Offering  an hour long Swedish massage for only $49.95 is just something I couldn't pass up. As you pull into the driveway it is a bit confusing. There are two houses that have been converted into the business. If facing the street the right one is where you check in. It has a quiet waiting room and my message therapist came and got me right one time. He was extremely professional and did an amazing job. He told me to let him know if the pressure got too much. My message was almost more of a deep tissue than the Swedish message I had signed up for but I loved it even more.
5 My family has been going here for here for 3.5 years now. We see Tracy Stevenson, PA. If you're looking for a respectful listener who won't rush you out of the exam room, she's your woman.  I have a 15 and 18 year old son and they trust and are comfortable talking to her as well. The office staff is efficient and friendly. They do a good job remembering their clients. I saw comments complaining about wait times. I am in this office at least every 3 months and I have had a bad wait time once or twice, and that was late in the afternoon, typical for most offices to be running behind.  There is a new Dr there and she is almost always behind, I understand. I will not see her. However,  Stevenson- PA, Smith-MD, Carroll-PA, these are the ones I see and trust. I am a self pay and found their office visits to be reasonable and Stevenson is sensitive to costs for self pay patients.  Stevenson is practical, down to Earth and treats you as if you have intelligence. Don't you hate medical professionals who talk as if they are the end all? She isn't that type. She is sharp, stays in the know, but is humble. She knows when it's time to go see a specialist and your situation is beyond her expertise. She will educate you and let YOU make the final treatment decision. I can't say enough good things about her professionalism and mannerism. I can't stand condescending doctors and that's why we stay. I loathe disorganized, overworked grumpy desk ladies. They don't work here! I find this office and it's staff in general to be  competent, respectful and affordable. I had a problem once with a staff member, reported it to the administration and they treated my feedback with respect and gratitude and I never had a problem with that particular staff member again. I recommend them to everyone looking for a place for the whole family. No office is perfect if they hire mortals. This place is pretty fantastic. They do have a lab in house for blood draws and that is convenient. I can usually get a same day appointment when I call first thing in the morning. The phones open at 8 am but if you walk in at 7 when they open you can get an appointment for that day. Give them a try.
1 I am rating this place 1 only because it gives a quick appointment. But i stongly believe that if you are suffering from something critical don't visit this place until and unless you are ready to risk your health and well being at the cost of just being able to show a doctor. I showed Dr. Ryan Pallett 2 times during last week. He is the most clueless doctor i have ever come across. Also i fully believe that he earns commission by referring tests to Toronto Centre for Medical screening. When i was having severe menstural bleeding last week he could have acknowledged that he did not have the medical expertise to treat me cause he had the most stupidest blank look i have ever seen on the face of a doctor while going through my records. He did multiple tests the first week and even when i told him that my condition is really bad and i am almost bedridden to earn more commission he twisted my report results and suggested me to go for more tests at Toronto Centre for Medical Screening without giving any importance to my serious condition. Thanks to him my life was more than a nightmare for the last one week. When a doctor looks so clueless you can make out from his face he does not nave ounce of idea what he is treating. Atleast he should have had the decency to suggest/refer me a gynaecologist instead of making me go through the unnecessary trauma and suffering just so that he can keep me scared and earn more money by doing more tests. I went there as a patient and not a guineapig i believe. The people who are worser than the doctor are the plastic faced and horrible receptionists they have kept at the place. I had to collect few reports from their centre to take to hospital as i didnt want to go through medical tests twice. When somehow i managed to get out of the car and walk to their reception and sat down my husband went to the counter with my health card. The receptionist bitch asked me to walk to the counter to her to take the reports from her. Looking at my condition she did not even have the basic human decency to walk to me ( i was 3-4 feets away from her).  Never in my life would i ever set foot inside that place again. St Michael's hospital is closeby , in case of urgency visit the emergency section and you will be in good hands. Avoid these cold corporate money making places who only try to make money by referals and doing more medical tests. Its ok place as a feel good boutique clinic where everybody smiles and try to appear professional, but if your health is at risk dont make it worse by visiting places like these.
1 This place is a HELL HOLE. My husband spent two weeks in a hospital with a bout of pneumonia  and copd. He was sent to kindred for some physical therapy so he could come home. In 4 days kindred managed to undo all the progress he had made in the hospital. Medication not given, most days my husband was left gasping for air, left sitting in feces because the nurses didn't bother answering his call. I was working on getting him transferred out of there when I got a call-he had been taken to emergency because he couldn't breathe. He passed away 2 days later. I will be letting Medicare know what kind of place this is that they are paying good money for, and will continue to tell anyone who will listen about what a disgrace this place is.
1 I had seen Erin Bradley many years ago before she had either taken a break/retired. She had referred all her patients to Dr. Togancci at that time. I recently found out she was back in practice and wanted to switch back to her. I tried to set up a new patient appointment today and the front staff receptionist was so extremely rude to me that I would never consider going to her again. It's sad because the doctor is very good, but I would never go to her because of the rudeness and unwillingness to help of her employees. Doctors should care and demand respect from their employees to their patients. It's sad that one bad interaction with the front staff can ruin a doctor's business.
4 I had a short wait on my visit to Dr. Harris and the staff was helpful in getting all my paperwork done. The Dr. was awesome, very personable and knowledgeable. They have a streamlined system and set me up the very next morning with bloodwork.  I had my results available through their phone system 24 hours after that.  Nice, helpful staff, and good doctors is almost all you can ask for in a clinic.
1 There are only two positive reviews (read: shills) for this company; both are from nearby in AZ.  I bought socks from them. Not cheap socks, but $60+ Jobst socks. They developed a hole on the third wearing. I tried to contact customer service online, but they want you to call. After lots of calling and tons of time on hold, I got a guy who coud have cared less about my defective product. He said he would follow up with me later that day. I heard from him 2 days later, via an email addressed to an unknown woman (I am a guy) referencing an entirely different order. I responded to his silly email and have not heard from anyone since.  They request reviews on their web site. I have submitted two different reviews for this product. They have yet to publish either.  A totally dishonest and bogus company from my standpoint. Stay away. I can't wait to sue.
3 I've been coming here for awhile. They are good at getting you in if you are sick or need to be seen on short notice. However, they are bad at getting you in on time. My appointment today was at 3:10. I arrived at 2:50. I wasn't taken back to a room until 2:25. I didn't see a doctor until 3:45. The irritating thing is that as I waited in the waiting room 10 mins after my appointment time, a patient walked in a few minutes late for his appt and was told that he couldn't be seen anymore because he was late. So a patient can't be late, but you can make me wait half an hour to see a doctor?  Do I get a discount since my time wasn't valuable to you?  In general in happy with the doctors here and the service. Just a little annoyed by the situation.
5 Dr Fabito, (AKA Dr. Fab-ulous), is a fantastic Pain Management Physician and person. He never misses! I've referred several friends and neighbors to his office and all of them agree that they've never had such a wonderful, dedicated physician. There's 1 simple reason: Dr. Fabito LISTENS to his patients. He then clearly and thoroughly explains his findings and suggested treatments. In fact, he anticipates any questions you might have later and provides the answers during your office visit. After years as Dr. Fabito's patient, with originally an emergency and now routine visits, I've never been so happy as a patient.
2 At My Dr. Now, you are just a number. On New Years' Day, my fiance was in a lot of pain from a chronic condition he has which flares up from time to time. We thought about going to the ER, but then decided to check to see if My Dr. Now was open to try to avoid the expense of an ER visit. They were open, but only the office in the far South East corner of the valley - over an hour drive for us.    We arrived 3 minutes after they closed, in part because we passed the office (No sign on the street) and had to turn around. They refused to see him, and as we sat there trying to figure out what to do next, three other families came to the door whom they also turned away. It was pretty obvious to me that the place has enough business to warrant extending the hours a bit more.    By the time we got to the ER, my fiance was shaking and sweating due to the pain. Because of this, the hospital decided to admit him to run a bunch of tests.He ended up spending three expensive days in the hospital from something that could have been handled easily with a few simple prescriptions.    I understand that it was a holiday, and that people want to get home. I could understand the strict closing time a little better if this was a free clinic in an inner city with a line out the door and 'round the corner. I don't understand why the only clinic they chose to have open that day was not closer to more of their patients, and I don't understand is when it became more important to follow a policy than to observe and meet the needs of real people.
5 I have been seeing Dr. López-Benitez for about five years now.  He has delivered my two babies and has been an amazing and professional ob-gyn. Very personable and will always hear you out if you are looking for a specific pregnancy journey.  He is also very honest and will talk out the pros and cons of your decisions. I saw him today for an annual exam and was seen very quickly. He answered any and all questions I had.  I highly recommend him. He has always had an amazing support staff as well,  the girls are on top of it,  and friendly.
1 They say you can use coupon for checking in on Yelp then send you bills for amount of prescription. Try to call their billing office, no one ever answers or returns calls. Then they send you to collection agency. Crooked crooked place, I will not return.
5 While I haven't done PT in the past, I have lived long enough to know a well-run business and quality staff when I see it.  This group works like a well-oiled machine under the skilled direction of Casey Bartolo, the "on-site manager" and head physical therapist.  They waste no time getting you back for your treatment and then getting you out into the gym.  You are in and out on time.  The gym staff is amazing, friendly and fun.  They make it their business to know you and what you are there for and they spend time teaching you how to do your exercises.  I hate to exercise but these guys are a joy to be with and make working fun.  They have an easy and amazing chemistry in working together and clearly enjoy their work.  I highly recommend this group if your doctor prescribes physical therapy.  I'll miss them.
3 Wie bereits erwähnt, ist die Praxis sehr modern und stilvoll eingerichtet ein wenig fühlt man sich in dem offenen Wartezimmer wie in einer unwirklichen Soap bei RTL. Die ruhige Chillout-Musik, die leise durch die Anlage in den Räumen zu hören ist, wirkt ebenfalls sehr positiv.  Die hübschen Dame am Empfang allerdings sind eher weniger positiv, ein herzliches Willkommen ist kaum zu spüren, ein kühles Hallo und ein angespanntes Lächeln.Der Doktor ist sehr freundlich aber wie auch die Damen am Empfang eher etwas unterkühlt, was auf manch anderen leicht arrogant wirken kann. Behandelt wurde ich trotz allem immer gut und war im großen und ganzen soweit zufrieden. Die Lage der Praxis ist perfekt, direkt an der S-Bahn Stadtmitte.
2 I only had 2 appointments with Dr. Sadowsky. The first one was wonderful! The front staff was very polite and helpful and the doctor really seemed to listen to me. I scheduled a follow up appointment for a few weeks later and was optimistic that I had found a doctor that would actually get to the bottom of my issues. She had me fill a prescription to have on hand just in case I needed it (for an illness I had never shown symptoms for, it was only $20, so I got it). The second appointment was not just bad but upsetting even. During this appointment, Dr. Sadowsky decided to "diagnose" me with an illness that I had never experienced symptoms for. She asked if I had used the medication and I said that after listening to the pharmacist and them explaining to me when to use it, I never needed it. The doctor got upset with me and began patronizing me. She even said that if I failed to use the medication I would die young and leave my children without a mother! I asked if there were any tests that could show me, even without symptoms, that I actually had this disorder (I wanted hard numbers). She said I could go see a specialist at the hospital and inferred that I would be uncomfortable there. I said I didn't mind going to a hospital and that I would love to have the tests done. She huffed at me and ripped the paper off the request sheet and told me that she would have to send the form over the next day. I said I could wait. She also told me to wait for the hospital to contact me to set up an appointment, only they never did. Dr. Sadowsky never sent the form. I found a new doctor, although farther away from me. The first thing that doctor did was order blood tests, Dr. Sadowsky never even offered to run labs. On top of that, I got a letter from collections 6 weeks later saying that I needed to pay my office visit fee, which I had done the same day as my appointment. My husband called to dispute it, as we had both receipts from the second office visit, which I had to pay for both the first and second appointments (the office messed up and told me I didn't owe for the first appointment even when i told them i should have a copay, they figured out I did need to pay at the next appointment).
5 Dr Boothe has an incredible gift and talent for healing and restoring the body to its optimum function and peak performance. He uses a combination of modalities such as soft tissue work, Graston, joint adjustments, and demonstrates/suggests exercises to ensure that you are feeling the relief and alignment you need to be on your "A" game. Dr. Boothe has been an essential part of my success as an avid runner, hiker, athlete who pushes herself to the limits.  I highly recommend Dr. Boothe to anyone needing relief from joint/muscle pain/discomfort, a boost in athletic performance, good postural integrity and to maintain optimal function. I am so incredibly grateful to have been blessed by his healing.
5 I took my new puppy here on the whim of a Groupon and a recommendation. I love my current vet, but they are so outrageously priced. I've tried other vets in the area, but was never as happy with the service as I was with said current vet, so I've always ate the cost. After my visit today, Greystone will be my new primary vet.   The facility looks pretty unassuming from the outside, but the inside is really nice! The staff are friendly, as is Dr. Kostal. We just came in for an exam and a mild illness so I obviously can't speak too extensively of the services, but being that I'm very picky and take my pet's healthcare pretty seriously I checked their Facebook page and between the reviews and wall posts, it's almost unanimously positive.   The pricing is very reasonable, what cost me $107 (not including Groupon discount) here would have cost me nearly $300 at the vet I've been going to. But, more importantly, I don't feel like I am sacrificing quality of service/care!
1 The Doctors here may or may not be great. You won't have a chance to find out because the office staff will frustrate you so badly you won't care to ever come back. We have given this office a few tries, hoping that our previous issues (terrible communication regarding test results and incorrect prescriptions sent to Walgreens twice) were just one offs and not a reflection of their business practices as a whole. When I called to inquire about an appointment today I was instantly dissapointed, again. They were clearly distracted and not listening as I had to repeat my questions a few times. She admitted she was "faxing an order". We will not be coming here again.
5 I have been coming to see Dr Marquard for about 1 year. Prior to that I had been doctor shopping for 3 years or so. I would either find an office with great staff, but a mediocre doctor (or one who runs late, or doesn't listen, or has bad bedside manner) or a nice doctor in an office with terrible staff. This office is the perfect combination!  Dr Marquard has a really great bedside manner. He is kind, cheerful, and a good listener. I really felt like he heard me, and we were actually able to have a discussion instead of just a lecture like some doctors do. I ended up getting a Nexplanon placed (which is a procedure that he actually does in the office - so hard to find!) and it went really well! He did a great job, it was a really fast, painless procedure. To top it all off the staff is so great! Everyone I interacted with was kind and answered all of my questions. I didn't wait long at all, maybe 15-20 minutes tops at my appointments. Labs are done in the office which is really convenient. One thing to keep in mind is that the office can be a little hard to find; on your first visit, come a little early to make sure you can spot it.  Overall great experience, and love to see continued improvements here. It's nice to finally find a doctor who is a great fit!
4 I just moved to Vegas in February and recently have been needing to see a doctor. I went to an urgent care about 2 weeks ago and was terribly unhappy with the doctor I saw. He didn't listen to me, didn't treat my condition correctly, and required a follow up appointment,  On the day of my followup appointment I decided I didn't want to return to that doctor so I took to a website called ZocDoc to find a doctor near my work that would take me same day. I finally ended up making an appointment to go to Community Family Doctors Ltd.  I had come here before, but ended up having to leave before I was called due to having to go back to work. I had filled out the new patient paperwork. I filled out the new patient paperwork again this time prior to my visit in order to save time if they hadn't kept it on file. To my surprise when I walked in the lady at the desk already had me checked and had verified my insurance! I was called back within 10 minutes. My nurse was friendly and personable, made me feel very comfortable.   I was seen by A.J. Marlon, and as a first time patient, I was nervous about whether or not he would actually listen to what I was saying. Not only did he listen to me, but he took notes on everything I said and made me extremely comfortable. He was knowledgeable and warm. He gave me referrals to other specialists in town that he trusts which I really appreciated because I have been having a very hard time finding good doctors.  I proceeded to get blood work done, and the phlebotomist was very good. Usually people are not able to locate the veins i my arm and have to get it through my hand, but she nailed it on my arm first try.  Overall I was very pleased with my experience and think I have found a great doctor in this area. I would definitely recommend Community Family Doctors Ltd.
1 Total fraud they charge you your copayment and then send you a bill saying they are not contracted with your insurance 4 months later.
1 Not sure about Dr. King but the receptionist Micah was one of the rudest people I have ever spoken with
1 Have been going there for years - Dr. Gardner is 3rd doctor I've seen there. (1st left practice, 2nd one could never get appt. as he is/was booked months in advance).  All the horror stories others have listed I've experienced.  Dr. Gardner is better than others there. Don't understand their NO FAX or online prescription refill policy as other doctor's offices usually emiail prescription to pharmacies directly. Last week my pharmacy faxed Forte Family Practice - Dr. Gardner 3 times for prescription renewal and Forte Family Practice never called either pharmacy or myself to say they don't accept FAX requests. Had to call doctor's office this morning and talked to nurse, told her the situation. Was told to come in this afternoon after her lunch and she'd see what she could do. Have sat in waiting room for over an 1 hour and then anohter hour in exam room when I missed appointment - it was at 11 AM and I thought it was 1 PM - and staff never said anything until after 2 hours I inquired why it was taking so long.  Response was: we were trying to fit you in.  Still no one said anything to me during the 2 hours I sat there.  I walked out without seeing doctor.  One day got call from medical services saying they needed to schedule a colonoscopy for me. Doctor had not discussed this with me when I last saw him 2 months prior to call. Refused to make appt. and called Forte to find out who ordered test and why I wasn't consulted.  Told they would look into it and get back to me - well months have gone by and I'm still waiting for their reply. Best one is I had 8 AM appt. with 1st doctor. Arrived 7:50 AM and was told doctor was running late. I assumed it was medical emergency or held up in traffic. Finally about 8:30 he breezes through waiting room carrying box of Duncan Donuts and cup of coffee. When he finally showed up in the exam room I said, "Where's my donut and cup of coffee."  He wasn't amused. So patient's time is not a concern to them. Only reason I continue to go to them is they are close to where I live.
5 My son who has Autism has been going to Nelson for about 10 years now and I just love coming here. From the front desk to the providers are wonderful.
3 It's not that Yuu Beauty is bad, because it's not. I've been quite a few times as the salon is quite convenient for my work and it's good and quick and handy.   The beauticians are friendly and the salon is pretty, tasteful etc, but I think the price is what's keeping the fourth star off for me. It's a bit expensive, but then I suppose all salons are ramping their prices up regularly.
5 Fantastic staff. Incredible doctor. Had really bad neck/upper back pain, got an adjustment & now feel great! Appointment was on Christmas Eve, they were very busy, but they still got me in and out shockingly fast.  Definitely recommend these fine folk for their services. Top-notch work.
5 The great folks at Back Fit Health and Spine helped me through a tough year last year after a severe auto accident.  I highly Recommend them for all of your Chiropractic, massage,  and pain therapy needs.
5 After a tibial plateau fracture and two surgeries to rebuild my knee with plates, screws, and bone grafts, I went through a year and a half of physical therapy.  Two different physical therapists and my surgeon told me that I would probably never regain my full range of motion and that I had to accept that my leg would never be 100% again.  As an active, healthy person, I was not willing to accept that!  I found Scott through a Google search and within a few sessions, I could already feel the difference.  He was able to get me back to a full range of motion and I have been able to go on extended backpacking trips carrying 30-45 lb. packs, wake board with no knee pain and, most days, I feel stronger than before I had my accident.  Scott is a lifesaver and extremely knowledgeable about how to fix problems efficiently.  He fixed (in about 8 sessions) what couldn't be fixed in a year and a half of 3x/wk physical therapy.  I highly recommend his services!!!
5 I started going to see Steve and his team in June and ended my therapy in October. They always made me feel welcome and made me laugh when I was in so much pain :-). Steve assured me he would get me back to where I was before my accident and he didn't disappoint. The staff is very professional, knowledgeable and caring - something that is hard to find these days! I would recommend Carling Aquatic & Physical Therapy to anyone who needed PT.
1 Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.  Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees.Normally I don't write reviews, good or bad. I see a lot of bad ones about wait times, but waiting is normal at doctors' offices. This appointment had me waiting about an hour, but I've had way worse. But this review is about the doctor, not the wait time. Dr. Imani Williams-Vaughn had the worst bedside manner I have ever experienced from a medical professional. I went in nervous and left fuming. To start with, she came in, didn't smile or shake my hand, and slouched down on the stool in the corner. She put off an air of a bored, lazy teenager and her attitude was no better. I told her I thought I may have had a miscarriage and she didn't say anything so I went on, telling her my story. I said that I had irregular periods to begin with, and that, after a missed one by a few weeks or so and some other side effects, I took a pregnancy test. I said that the test was positive, but I had heard store bought pregnancy tests were unreliable. Then, after about a week, I started to have a very heavy, clotted period. Then I said, "So I think I was pregnant..." And was about to finish by saying that I thought I had a miscarriage and wanted to get checked out to make sure. But I got interrupted by her saying, "Uh, ya THINK you were pregnant?" She had a look on her face like I was an unbelievable idiot. So then she goes out to check if my pregnancy test was done and she comes back in and says, "No more prego," shrugs, and changed the subject without even asking how I felt about it or letting me know what to do next. I thought, after a miscarriage, that one was supposed to get checked out. But she couldn't be bothered. So we went on to the second reason why I came in, which was to have a hormone panel done. I told her I have struggled with my weight all my life no matter how well I eat or exercise. I eat less than 1200 calories a day and work out five days a week, and the foods I eat are low carb. I shouldn't have to work that hard and only be able to maintain a heavy weight. So she asked me what my activity level consisted of. I started by saying, "Well first of all, I am on my feet all day..." I was going to finish by telling her that I work in a warehouse and walk 5-8 miles a day, and then tell her about my actual workout regimen. However, she immediately interrupted me and rudely said, "Nuh uh. What else ya got?" I just looked at her in disbelief. When we went on I had to ask her many questions because she didn't offer any information on the tests she was ordering on me, and she gave me one word answers. Finally she left the room, making me think she was coming back, but she never did. Her nurse finished with me and the doctor never even finished with me or said good bye. It was the more horrible medical visit I ever had. She was rude, disrespectful, and unprofessional. This review is long, but I hope it was helpful to anyone thinking of going to this doctor. Finally, the practice charges you $25 for copies of your medical records, which I think is unethical. Bottom line, I'll never be back.
5 Right next to Dundas Square and the line moves pretty fast so even if you're a walk in, chances are, you'll be able to see a doctor.  Staff at the front desk aren't chatty by any means but they're friendly and have big smiles ready for you. After meeting Dr. Jessica Yu once, I switched over to her as my family doctor immediately. She looks pretty young but she takes her profession very seriously. She listens patiently while you explain what's going on and she always has tons of recommendations. She explains her thought process in very fine detail to make sure you're fully informed. She's all anyone could possibly want in a doctor. Also, she has wonderful bedside manners. She remembers me even though I go in maybe once every few months.  I highly recommend this clinic. I've moved uptown since I switched over but I refuse to switch over to another doctor.  After I switched over to her, I called my sister and she went in a for a visit and came out with a new family doctor too with the following text 'i love her' and this is coming from a very hard-to-impress sister.
1 Service sucks and the Doctors could care less. They just want the money!
5 I moved to Peoria, AZ in 2013 . . . Please see review in Peoria account.
5 Where do I start there so many wonderful and great things I could say about Dr. Burroff. My mother who's 78 has a lot of health problems especially she has a severe heart problems and she insist only on going to sunrise Hospital. I had to look for a doctor that's on staff at sunrise Hospital and that's how I found Dr. Burroff.  The day I found him to be my mother's primary doctor I feel we were blessed. I could say he is the best primary doctor I have had the pleasure to meet in all of southern Nevada. I could tell you that in the 30+ years that I have lived in southern Nevada I have been to a lot of primary doctors with my mother's health and as well with my husband's health. Any doctor we have ever gone to we always feel rushed, that is not the case with Dr. Burroff. My mother ended up in the emergency room at sunrise Hospital and then was admitted to the hospital  Dr Burroff visit her every single day that she was in the hospital and she was there over a week. And unfortunately in the past three months she has been in and out of the hospital a lot and he always has been there every single day to see her. Again he never seem in a rush even after his long days at work and then going and visiting his patients at the hospital. I highly recommend Dr. Burroff
4 The facility is very new and nice. Some of the staff are exceptional and some are what you'd expect to find at the VA... The guy who did the blood draw on me was super friendly, did an awesome job, and was very professional.
5 Went to just get established and have some blood work done for nursing school. The staff was friendly and cordial. The PA I saw I can't rave about enough, she sat here and talked with me about everything I wanted to clear up. She was friendly and caring, and thoroughly explained things to me! So happy I chose to wait a few weeks to get into this place!
1 No stars is more like it. Run people, run. If they treat adults the way they do, I can only imagine how they treat your kids behind closed doors. Candy or Candice is the rudest Christmas elf I have ever encountered. We pulled out son out of speech under the promise they had reoccurring appointments for him. We did this back in May. Today December 23 was the first time they could get us in. We had another appointment back in October for his occupational therapy. We had to cancel due to a fever. They wanted 10.00 bucks. For not giving 24 hours notice. Hello kids get sick. We told them we will pay when he gets his appointments . They said we would have to wait until one became available. 6 days a week. 3 for speech 3 for occupational therapy. Needless to say they can go scratch. They then told my wife I refused to fill out paper work or pay the 10.00 bucks. Which I did do because I knew this was the last time I would ever walk into the door.  Then at the end of his appointment which was only 30 minutes although we had an hour scheduled. I was informed they couldn't finish the evaluation because she didn't have enough time. Appointment was 10 am we arrived at 940am. Place is a joke. A meat house for your children. Just read the other reviews.
5 Dr. Petrick and his staff at the Las Vegas Pain Relief Center are amazing.  I hurt my back and was in a lot of pain from taking care of my mother before she passed and along with Dr. Robey and Ay San, Dr. Petrick helped me feel better and got me back on my feet in a few visits.  What makes them even more special is that besides being so skilled and talented at what they do they express care and genuine concern for all of their patients.  In fact, they are currently one of five nominees in the Chiropractic category of this year's Silver State Awards XIX - Health & Fitness, which will hold its Awards Ceremony on June 10th at the South Point Hotel and Casino.  Also, in case you re closer to Summerlin The Center has another office located at 4015 S El Capitan Way in Las Vegas.
1 I hate the office staff here. They have no idea what it is to be helpful. They care more about finishing their conversations with each other than helping out the patient in front of them. The only reason I am still at this office is because of one of the PA's. Nicole is so helpful and caring. Her and her nurse are the only reason you should go to this office. Dr Shockey is an ass.
5 I had PT at Kelly Hawkins Physical Therapy Works last July until around September.  I had broken my ankle in two places.  Kim Wilkes is an excellent PT and I enjoyed having her.  Staff is so great!  My ankle is getting little better, but unfortunately, I went to see ortho specialist in Henderson for follow up due to stupid NYS Human Resource representative is bitching at me on going back to work.  I was being transferred to Matt Smith PT in Henderson for more PT sessions.
5 I saw NP Bell and she is fantastic! She is a wonderful listener pays, attention to details and evaluated my condition completely.  When I left I knew what was going on and when my test results were returned to the office they called me immediately.
1 Patient BEWARE!  I am disgusted with MD24. Specifically a Podiatrist that came into my family members Dementia Care facility and told them they were going to die and have their foot cut off!  Seriously who speaks to a dementia patient like that!! Several Nurses and Care Givers spent the rest of the day trying to calm down my family member after this incident.. This podiatrist was asked by the Facility Director to leave and is not allowed back....ever. MD24 has non existent communication and I call at least three times before the Dr. calls back.  Scheduling is usually a problem and billing is ridiculous.  Again, Patient Beware!
2 For the 2 times I went there, I would have given maybe 3-4 stars, and a positive review. I used Groupon and found them by the way...they had a deal going on for 2 days of chiro, massage, x-rays, etc for a certain price. On day 1, my first red flag was them asking for my insurance card and taking down my info.  The reason I'm rating so low is because I do not like the "car sales" man pitch on trying to make me purchase their "package". Yes it costs money to go to the dr, but it was too pushy and weird for me. I also was the one to remind them hey what about my x-rays? Can I see them? And I also asked if they could give me my notes/findings both days I went to have for my record (the whole point of going is to know and find out what is wrong with your body first) but they said that they couldn't, or even create a file for me unless I signed the paperwork and became an actual patient with them first. Seems like a scam to me. The massage portion was nice though and everyone was friendly enough.
5 Did a lot of research and finally decided on Dr Duddy. So thrilled we came here.   We arrived 30 min early for paperwork and the office staff were really sweet. I believe I spoke with Marilyn.   We were seen on time and had very little wait between the nurse and Dr.   Nurse was really great, I think her name was Renae. She interacted with my kids a lot.   Dr Duddy was awesome. Answered all our questions and didn't make us feel rushed.   Only con was that we called a few weeks ago because my daughter had a swollen lymphnoid after she got the flu and the nurse wanted us to come in for something that didn't even resemble her symptoms.
5 I have been a patient of Dr. Sameera Sbaih, since she use to work over at Genesis Medical Group/Parkway Urgent Care on Green Valley Parkway. It was wonderful to hear she was establishing her own private practive. She is an excellent, caring physician. With her new practice (moved there in October of 2009). She spends plenty of time with all of her patients. You never feel like your rushed or bothering her, unlike so many other places I've been or visited over the years.
5 After being diagnosed with a bicep tendon tear from playing tennis, my doctor recommended that I find a Physical Therapist who could help me rehabilitate my arm without surgery.  I searched around for options and ultimately was referred to Landmark Physical Therapy by a tennis friend.  I can highly recommended Landmark Physical Therapy and Mark and Jordan who helped me.  Both were very qualified and were good at explaining the physical therapy I needed.  In addition to the office treatments, they provided me a detailed set of exercises to perform at home.  After 6 sessions, I'm back to playing tennis again.  Thank you very much!  Al E.
4 Delayed getting to this review-maybe I was just too relaxed after the massage?  I was really happy with the whole Toronto Bodyworks experience. I love it when companies are contactable by email and they are super quick to respond. Booking an appointment was simple and they managed to get me in on a Sunday at a time that suited me. I love it that booking a massage to relieve stress was so stress free!  I know people have mentioned it being above a restaurant and I did notice the aroma of food as I walked in the door downstairs but didn't notice that at all by the time I got upstairs to Bodyworks. There's a small waiting area which is cosy with hooks for coats etc and a reception desk. I was greeted warmly and wasn't waiting to be brought into the treatment room. The room itself was bright and clean. I also found it pretty quiet despite facing onto the street.  My therapist was Ada and we did the usual intake form and had a chat about all my aches and pains before she got to work. I had only booked a one hour massage and that might have been a bit too short. She spent a long time on my legs so I probably didn't have as much time as needed on my neck and shoulders. I think that was more because my legs really needed work than a criticism of the massage. In retrospect a longer massage might have been better when I had so many problem areas! Ada is tiny but managed to get out lots of the knots and was really knowledgeable as well as friendly and sweet.   Payment was easy-card or cash and you get an RMT receipt for insurance claims. It's a little steep at $85 for 60 minutes; but it's hard to find a good massage cheaper than that anyway. Everyone I encountered was professional, friendly and seemed to be enthusiastic about actually helping people. If I wasn't flat broke I'd be there every week!
3 Need better customer service at front desk. Insurance approval didn't take that long so why book out the appt.  Came in for appt and girl at desk was on phone with a potential client for so long she should have put them on hold and checked us in instead she stayed on with no sense of urgency and when someone who did not have an appt walk in after us she helped her first and got in her in...and don't pick and choose who to fill out survey.
4 AZ Chiropractic is my first experience with a chiro. I had a pinched scapula nerve for a couple weeks that was making my fingers numb. I tried a massage, but didn't even touch the issue. All suggestions were to go to a chiropractor. I Groupon'd my first appointment for a massage and adjustment. I HATED the massage because it hurt so much, but did feel better afterward. I went back a couple days later for trigger point injections of a holistic compound. I had hope after just two appointments that relief was a possibility. They worked on me and with my insurance and got me back to "normal." I cannot say enough wonderful things about Ana's masseuse skills. The place is casual, friendly and accommodating. I've referred a co-worker and she's thrilled with her results as well.
5 I just want to share how awesome the staff are at Spooner Desert Ridge!! Heather and Cole treated me and addressed all my concerns, I can't say enough wonderful things about them! Heather explained what was going on and causing my problems; she guided me through exercises and therapy that helped me to achieve great improvement!  All the staff are friendly and welcoming providing a very positive energy. I highly recommend Spooner at Desert Ridge, I know it will be my go to for physical therapy!
5 This is my go to spa for a relaxing massage. I was introduced by a family member and have enjoyed both visits. The client's experiences are pleasurable and comfortable and massages away all of your tension. The spa is clean, relaxing, and professional.
1 HORRIBLE. If I could give negative stars I totally would, the only reason I came back to this particular chain of urgent cares was because of how amazing the service was at the Henderson location. Well definitely not the case here.. These girls are as rude as can be and I work in the Medical field so I have a tiny bit more patience and understanding as to why things can get backed up. But this is ridiculous since I've been here (2 hours) they have called back a whopping 2 patients but a total of 6 patients have left wtf are they doing back there? Front desk girls are horrible and rude and clearly don't know how to do their job, lose the attitude because there are plenty of people who would love your job. I went up to check how much longer it would be and why I still haven't received my ID and insurance card back, well because instead of verifying it like they should have two hours ago they stacked people that came in AFTER me on top of it and are taking care of them first.  I'm so ridiculously over this place it's not even funny but I'd rather wait it out here then step foot inside UMC..
5 I actually found Dr. Reed on Yelp last Fall.  I was a bit wary about seeing a chiropractor but was really stiff and uncomfortable. I had always had "crunchy neck" from hunching over a computer most days & began to have hip/back problems as well, which was affecting my sleep.  I have been going for 6 months & have seen great improvement. Dr. Reed & Michelle are very nice & put you at ease. I am now visiting 2x month & always feel great after my adjustment; I have confidence in his skills & care.  I also appreciate the emphasis on health, exercise & nutrition + love the rolling massage table, so relaxing!  I will be a continuing customer at Reed Chiropractic.
1 Terrible wait times. It's absolutely absurd when you make an appointment, have three people ahead of you and still have to wait over an hour and a half!!! Not like the doctors in this town spend more than 10 minutes (tops) with a patient anyway... Ridiculous.
1 This is not a family medical facility. More like an Urgent Care facility at best. Appointments are always late, you can only discuss one issue per visit and only allowed 10 minutes!  Although you have a primary care person, there is no relationship what so ever with that person. It always feels like your visit is taking staff away from there free time
4 Like this place a lot! Appointments can feel a little rushed, but that's more due to volume than the doctors themselves. Dr. Yu came highly recommended by someone I trust and I really like her - she never talks down to you or invalidates how you're feeling.   I've had great results with the physio clinic and even the Thursday night yoga classes are excellent. So nice to have all of my health and wellness needs consolidated in one place!
5 This is truly deep tissue massage Worked out the knots / pain / injury Very Thorough Work 90 minutes was the "right" amount of time Suzi/Teressa really understands where the pain is coming from and what else if affected One of the best massages (muscle therapy) I've ever received - wish they have this in my town With all the great choices in Scottsdale - the bang for the buck was phenomenal Full body release - she worked not just the problem area, but the entire body.
5 I've been here twice now because one of my doctors works out of here part time and it always happens to be when my schedule allows! The man working the front check-in desk is literally BEYOND friendly. This isn't always the case at medical practices and I really really love it! I wish that I knew his name but he checks in patients for Dr. Mourad and deserves some major customer service kudos!   This facility is always super clean - like I could eat off of the bathroom floor clean. Parking is SUPER easy, there is plenty of it, and right next to the entrance. I don't mind making the extra drive to come out to this nice facility versus dealing with Midtown Phoenix craziness! :) Especially for one of the best docs around!
1 I went because I needed a note for my fibromyaltia.  The woman Dr./practitioner was very ruid.  I think she thought I came in for pain meds.  My sup needed 1 for hr to explain the fibromyaltia.  She came in with attitude and left with attitude stating let me look at your chart and I'll get you a prescription.  She thru me off first like she was attacking me.  I work for a living 7 days a week and I definately didn't need to be treated that way.  I walked out with nothing.  I guess when you treat most people that are on welfare you automatically expect people are wanting pain meds.  If I sound angry I am.  No one should be treated that way period.
1 Would give them zero stars if I could. I have been here twice and both times was not seen until over an hour after my appointment time.
5 I've been to multiple chiropractors in the past and Dr. Boothe is the best. It's like going to see a physical therapist, massage therapist and chiropractor all in one. Prior to seeing him I had horrible neck pain for almost a year despite continuing to see a chiropractor. Upon a friend's recommendation, I hesitantly went to see Dr. Boothe truly believing he couldn't do more than what my current chiro was doing. Glad I was wrong! After just 3 visits I noticed a difference and before long I was feeling better. In short- if you're in pain and tired of it go see Dr. Boothe.
5 First time here. My experience was amazing. I used to be a member at Massage Envy for 3 years and cancelled my membership because it was extremely hard to get in at times that worked to me. I had Eddie and he was GREAT! Probably one of the better massages I've ever had. My massage was therapeutic and relaxing. Their member program is AMAZING. Way better than massage envy and you can share your massages with friends. I HIGHLY recommend going here. I will definitely be returning to Eddie.
1 I have been a patient of Dr. Adams for about 6 years. I do like her but her staff is awful. They never answer the phone and never give you a call back.I was having terrible back pain and tried to get an appointment but they never called me back or answered the phone. I had to go to another Dr. I really wish Dr. Adams would know what is going on with her incompetent and rude staff.
3 Good people but lousy wait times. This is my second time I've waited an hour or more to be seen. Over scheduling appointment times seems to be the norm. I do not like being held over the barrel to be seen by the doctors' assistant for a progress check. Patients get stacked up in the waiting room as if our time isn't valuable or important. This needs to be fixed!
1 I had a follow up appointment here at 1:00. I was called back around 1 and they took my blood pressure then told to go back to waiting room until a room opened. At 1:15 I asked front desk how long it would be because I had to work that day.  She looked at the files and said there were 7 appointments a head of me!!! 7!!!! Why even make an appointment if you can not see the patient somewhere close to their appointment time??? Not only did I waste my time but wasted gas driving there for nothing!
4 Travis is very nice and helpful
5 I have been at Sunview since November in the activities department. As with all things coming into a new environment has taken ajustment, but the staff has been so supportive and helpful it has made my experience amazing. I have seen first hand how staff put their heart into their work. The willingness to grow and continue to strive for the best is what makes this place work wonderful.
5 Dr. Johnston is a terrific physician. He takes time with his patients and is thoughtful and compassionate in his treatment. In the past I have had a few issues with billing/scheduling as mentioned by posters below - however it seems that they have recently revamped their office staff to correct this and to increase the friendliness/effectiveness of their operations team. Sarah at the front desk is especially calm, friendly, and excellent at her job. Really fortunate to be a patient at this terrific practice.
1 I'm sitting in the office right now. It's 12:00p, I arrived at 11:05a and my appointment was at 11:15. Someone please tell me why I'm still in the waiting room? Ohhh and I'm sitting next to another patient with the same appt time, also still waiting. Office staff and doctors should make a point to respect the time of their patients.  Scheduling several patients for the same time is bad for business and very unprofessional. This is the third time I've been here and will be the last.
4 So I'm not a big doctor person for a few reasons. One, doctors scare me. They make me feel all insecure assuming that they scold you for not properly taking care of your health if something is wrong with you, and I hate being scolded. Two, the wait I'd always so long and I feel like you are just one of the hundreds of people they tend to on a daily basis so I feel like I am just another patient. Three, doctor bills give me heart attacks. If I could sow my arm back into place if I could I would just to avoid the doctors, but I'm sure my doctor wouldn't approve of that.  Dr. Jimenez was recommended by a family friend so when I had to go to a doctor I thought I'd give him a try. If a trustworthy person says he's cool then I'll pray he is. A long wait was unavoidable so I did have to wait a few hours being that I was a walk in. The nursing assistants are so friendly and chipper! Being that it is a family practice center I guess I shouldn't doubt that seeing as though they're not all frantic with caring for a whole bunch of people. They made me feel at ease and comfortable there, and from the looks of it, the staff seems like theyre all just one big happy family. It is a really small waiting room but it makes up for the big flat screen that plays good movies (I got to watch the whole RED movie which I was glad for because I never get to finish it). When it was finally time for me to get checked up the nursing assistant was very friendly and nice she even let my mom take her blood pressure and weight herself for fun. Then dr. Jimenez walked Into the room with his million dollar smile and his pimped out leather weaved loafers and matching button up. He was very perky, and asked me questions in a friendly manner. Then quickly diagnosed me and made sure I come back for a check up. He didn't tell me in a stern way to where I felt awful and pressured. It was more like he was concerned and wanted to make sure my health was up to par. I'd definitely recommend him. This place just makes you feel comfortable being in a doctors office. The wait is the only downfall, but then again he is the only doctor.
1 BEWARE! RUN AWAY ASAP!!! Have been a patient of Kochy Tang for over 10 years. Had a concern about some very sensitive information (HIPAA) being shared unnecessarily. Reassured by staff it would not be shared. Well, it was shared & by Kochy Tang herself.  When I voiced my concern, instead of Kochy Tang addressing the issue like an adult, and as a professional should, she discharged me instead. Quite the cowardly move. One can only assume the doctor feels like you're beneath her, so how dare you question her?  I have since filed a complaint with the Office of Civil Rights at the Department of Health and Human Services.
1 Disappointed and offended doesn't begin to describe my experience. First appointment was great. Second appt felt like I was talking with a car salesman. To top it off, I was left waiting for 45 minutes to meet with them. The first guy was supposed to tell me what the X-rays said. He never made eye contact and kept scribbling on s piece of paper. Weird! Guy #2 was the salesman. I will not be back!
5 I visited only because i was referred by a good friend.  I can honestly say I was impressed as much as from the results as from Dr Greg taking the time to explain chiropractic care and the adjustment process.  Excellent!!
2 Staff is sweet and Dr. Pingol is very nice, but plan on a VERY long wait. I have been to this office twice now and I have waited over an hour past my appointment time without anyone acknowledged me. I know they are physicians and unexpected things come up but its just not acceptable.
1 Over 2 hrs waiting to see the doctor. The doc tried to take x-ray even I had one a month ago. I told the receptionist that I waited over 2 hrs. She just said "oh its one of the days."
5 I get both chiropractic adjustments and massages at the Center, and I highly recommend Dr. Darr and his staff for their continuing high standards of quality chiropractic care. Dr. Darr is very personable and he thoroughly explains his recommendations for your treatment - providing a reassuring, pleasant experience, especially for first-time patients. His support staff, from receptionist to massage therapists, add to the overall friendliness of the office.
1 Awful!!   They denied me care because I had insurance they did not accept, which I new this.  I was always going to pay cash like I always have in the past and today they told me, "it's ILLEGAL for us to see/treat you as a cash pay patient."  I HAVE NEVER IN MY LIFE HEARD OF THIS!!! NOT ONE OTHER PERSON I KNOW HAS HEARD OF THIS EVEN DOCTORS!!!   My plan also has a Non-Plan Provider Benefit so this just blew my mind!!!
5 Atlas Mens Health Institute is a wonderful place to fell energized and get that boost of health you need.
5 Great Dr. I been there 5 times and not disappoint at all 5!  Dr. Work from her heart and soul . Don't listen to what you hear . My point is....it's hard to find a good Dr. Like Kimberly Adams, and just because she's alway busy! Give her a break about her employees, I am sure she'll try to improve everything.  Not thing can change me from loving her. She is AWESOME!!!
1 Scheduled an appointment several days out as a new patient. Gave them all my insurance info over the phone and then showed up for my appointment and they told me they couldn't see me because it's the weekend and they had no way to verify my insurance. Don't waste your time with these clowns.
5 Follow up review: had occasion to bring my wife in, got an appt within 2 days (for the PA), and at her appt, she got in and out in 27 minutes!   1. The good: Dr Shreder is fantastic, best PCP (and AME) I've had. He gets 5 stars. :-) 2. The bad: too often my appointments have gone way beyond normal. Today's appt was 1045, got in at 1125, out at 1205.  I know he's good, that's why his practice is so busy, but  scheduling needs to improve. Then the practice would be a 5 star
5 I tried Rehab Plus out after injuring my shoulder and I really can't say enough great things about the place and staff.  Throughout my baseball career including: high school, collegiate, and semi-professional, I thought that I had experienced what I thought was some of the best rehabilitation and training in the country, but after visiting Rehab Plus I was wrong.  From the first time I went in to the last time, the staff was very knowledgeable and very supportive in helping me get back to full form.  The trainers and Physical therapists at Rehab Plus are second to none.  After only about five sessions of doing unique strength, rehab, and stretching exercises I had already felt ten times better.    Being an athlete my whole life I have always been a huge believer in positive thinking and having a proactive attitude.  I can tell you first hand that the personnel at Rehab Plus share this fundamental belief.  The atmosphere at Rehab Plus is very supportive and positive created by the trainers, physical therapists, and residual staff.  A couple of things that give Rehab Plus an edge over similar places is that the personnel are progressive and are so well versed in their areas of expertise.  Many places I've been to in the past are stuck on old philosophies that don't get optimal results.  Rehab Plus strives to be the best by catering to the needs of their clients such as: rehabilitation, sports performance, strength and conditioning, and much more.
5 Fast, competent, thorough. One stop shop. Reasonably priced for the uninsured. I've been here 3 times now and our experience has been consistent. First, the waiting room is a winner...large so you're not catching what your neighbor has, and the chairs are thick and comfy. You wouldn't mind if you had a long wait because the chairs are great and there is a big screen tv there too. Never waited more than 15 minutes. Usual wait has been 5! I've been on weeknight, weekday and a Sunday night. The docs and P.A.'s treat you like you've got a brain. X-rays on site if you need them. Fast! Pharmacy too, and they give you the option to use them without pressuring you. There's a CVS right next door. We have never felt rushed during exam. When you leave, they give you the best follow up sheet I've ever seen which includes your diagnosis, what it means, what to do when to come back if necessary. It's thorough and easy to understand. This is an outstanding clinic all around. They've earned my trust and my recommendation. You won't regret working with this office.
1 The worst. I went to Dr. Charniga because I was looking for a new primary care physician. The office is clean, and I was taken back to the appointment room within 10 minutes, so I felt good about it. Then it went completely downhill from there. The nurse was rude, moving me between 3 different rooms, with nothing more than a "get your stuff". When I FINALLY saw the Dr. after another 30 minutes, she didn't once look up from her laptop. I told her I had three things that I wanted to talk to her about, she said "no, you can only pick one".  After 4 minutes of asking me questions and answering none for me, she leaves. I get moved to yet another room, have blood drawn and am told "you're done". No follow up from the Dr., no "this is what's happening next". Just get told to go to the waiting room. I have to find out from the secretary that I have multiple referrals for issues. The secretary tells me this. Not the doctor or even the nurse. The secretary has to do it. And come to find out a week later when I actually get the referrals that half are for wrong types of doctors. I've followed up twice with her office to correct this and it's still not resolved. Don't go here unless you enjoy wasting your time, money and emotional reserves.
2 Our fam doctor is here. She's fine.   The receptionists are useless. I waited 20 min on hold before they simply hung up. When you show up for scheduled appts, they're pretty surly.   But surly reception is to be honest, one universal of our health care system. I think it's so you don't WANT to call.
1 I too have had to wait over n hour almost each time I went there and after my last experience of being extremely misdiagnose we will now be going elsewhere. Would never recommend.
5 Awesome urgent care. After leaving the urgent care on 83rd and Thunderbird for ridiculous rude treatment came here and so soso soso happy!!!! They were fast and friendly and  respectful to my son and our urgent need. Thank you thank you. So glad your close to me.
5 Great place! Friendly supportive staff, flexible appointment options. KT really helped me with my elbow, and got me back on track. Highly recommended this place :)
4 I had knee surgery a month ago and have been going here 2-4 times a week for a few weeks. The staff is great. You truly feel that they want to do everything in their power to succeed. They also set you up with exercises I can do at home. As far as staff I would give them a five. The reason I'm giving this place a 4 is because I think that it could be bigger. It feels very crowded in there and me having just having knee surgery have to be careful moving around with all the tables, stools and other equipment.
5 My wife Sherry started here for post surgical PT.  While driving her over I got interested in working out to develop my core for golf.  I have been at it for four months and I can definitely feel the improvements.  Golf game is improving and gaining distance.  This is a group oh highly professional and dedicated people.  Very positive and friendly atmosphere. I rarely  write a review,but in this case I made the exception because of the great experience my wife and I have had.
5 I love Dr. J!!! He's been our Family Care Physician for almost a decade now and have recommended him to family and friends. He always takes time to every health issues and concerns which I believe is his #1 trait that is why he has a steady flow of patients. I hate doctors who asked you to wait forever and then see you for only 5 minutes without even explaining what's the actual cause of your concern. More power to Dr. J and his wonderful staff!!!
5 Dr. Chrystal Taylor is the most empathetic and best doctor I have seen. She knows how to listen to her patients and really cares. Thank you so much everyone at this clinic. You are the best.
1 The most awful place if you need help and want to speak to someone about urgent care needs. If you are insured no problem, but if you are in transition and need help with your medications, they will close the door in your face and WILL not call you back   to see if there is anything that can be done to help you.   When I was was with them, they gave me every test imaginable that my insurance could pay even if I didn't need it! You eventually become a "number" to them and not a human patient.   I will never use the services at that facility again. Beware and stay away!!!!!
5 I have attended to the Chiropractor on site there, Dr. Eric Marcotte.  He is simply one of the best clinical practitioners in the business.  He lives the chiropractic lifestyle and is excellent with his hands. The difference in his abilities include the knowledge of healthy protocols, coordination and application of his adjusting technique that re-aligns the spine for my optimum performance.  I am a recreational runner, logging about 100 miles a month and keeping things lined up keeps me from wearing out.
3 Friendly staff. The physical therapist, Dr. Holly, is very competent. Same goes for a couple of the chiropractors, particularly Dr. Radi, and a massage therapist named Christina. The MA's are also very personable. However, I had a pretty lousy experience during one of the tests they did on me - some sort of muscle transduction test where they  pressed a tool against my foot, then ankle, then leg (hoping to determine how fast my muscles picked up on signals from my brain), but the nurse who was supposed to be a pro at it seemed to hardly know what she was doing. At all. She was training an MA on how to run the test, and the MA seemed more confident, coordinated, and intelligent. It was a painful test run by someone who didn't seem to know what she was doing. When chiropractics/PT/and massage weren't improving my lower back, they suggested injections - PRP or prolo, which are both offered by someone in their office. But after my experience with one of their nurses, I decided injections to my back by someone else in that office was not a good idea. So I left, found a prolo dr in Scottsdale, and never turned back.
3 Front desk staff likes to help without a smile...  They are the first contact with this establishment.  A little smile would be nice.  They're all young and just plain inexperience.  Scheduling staff is very efficient and very helpful, they work with you and give you all the info needed.  The doctors and PA's are awesome!  They know what they're talking about and when asked for a clearer, in layman's terms explanation, they take the time to explain what the problem is and how they are planning to resolve the problem.  Now if we can only improve on the reception issue... :)
5 PA Kim Brabentz is great.  We've been with her over 10 years. Love this new office, Aveon, that she's with now.  With every visit (3 in the past 6 mos) the check in process was efficient and wait time less than 5 minutes!  As always, Dr Kim takes time to talk and listen and always asks if there's anything else of concern.
3 My son has been going here for about 4 weeks now and we have seen some changes in him. They did recommend 3 speech and 3 occupational therapy sessions a week which would be great if we could get appointments for them. They are really hard to get into due to how busy they are. We are hoping to get on a more regular schedule soon or we may have to look into someone else for his therapy.
1 By the time you read this review I am still waiting to see a doctor... Look at the date this was posted.
1 I missed my appointment yesterday because I was in another appointment with my MD and had my phone turned off since. I have both a urinary tract and sinus infection and have been bed ridden with complete exhaustion. I received a call from the office yesterday and once again today. Thinking that they were calling out of concern, I quickly found that they were simply calling to tell me that they're charging me a no show fee. Clara was quite snarky in telling me this. There was no concern whatsoever about why I uncharacteristically didn't show for my appointment or any empathy whatsoever about being so ill that I can't eat or even get out of bed.   The lack of compassion for a patient is unreal! I've often felt like just a number when I've gone to my visits and now it's been confirmed that all Dr. Bates cares about it making a quick buck. If you're looking for a chiropractor who cares about their patients, look elsewhere.   I've also noticed that there is a lot of staff turnover, which makes me wonder how he treats his staff.  *Dr. Bates response is a lie. I did not miss any appointments prior to that one. He is callous and is only concerned about his financial bottom line. He has written two responses, the first one included the original date I saw him and the number of visits I had. Medical history is private and he is jeopardizing a patient's ability to obtain a job by demonstrating that you need time off for all the visits.
4 The actual location on a side street and the office is quiet, clean and zen.  The support staff are professional.  The price was much more reflective of going RMT rates compared to spas that overcharge just because.  My RMT, Hilary, is younger and just started working in January.  She is very strong and was helpful after my massage by talking about some stretches and strength exercises that I could do.  I will definitely be making this my regular place for RMT.  Only down side is that room 6 had a noisy vent fan that could not be controlled.  Would recommend!
3 Es gibt ja Allgemeinärzte und Allgemeinärzte. Die erste Sorte sind die die mit einem Blick den Patienten scannen, durchleuchten, einschätzen und geniale Diagnostiker sind, sie finden alles, egal ob eingewachsener Zehennagel oder Magenkrebs. Die zweite Sorte sind die die ziellos heurmwursteln, nichts finden und sich schließlich in Allgemeinplätzen verlieren wie mehr Ruhe, ausspannen, mal ein paar Tage kürzer treten, heiße Bäder.  Rauchen Sie? Nein? Dann lassen Sie mal den Alkohol ein paar Tage weg.  Heh? Ich trinke nicht täglich Alkohol, nehme keine Tabletten, trinke nicht literweise Kaffee, ernähre mich bewusst, bewege mich wirklich, wirklich viel - zu dumm auch für die Dame. Sie ist sehr nett und freundlich, bemüht und alles  aber zur ersten Sorte gehört sie nicht. Da gibts besseres hier oben..
5 Dr. Holder and his staff are fantastic.  they have been taking care of our family for the last few years.  We have also seen both Kelli and April who are Dr. Holders PA's and the quality of the care is fantastic.  We have referred many of our friends to their office and everyone agrees they its a top notch family practice.
5 The bad review got my attention.  I have nothing but good to say about this place.  I was actually a patient of Dr. Rea in the late 80's.  If you understood this kind of allergy testing you would be thankful to find this place as I was.  Yes, Sharon is the owner, but she was also a patient at one time.  She is so full of knowledge, it amazes me at times.  I just changed primary care doctors to Dr. Liszewski.  He is one of the best doctors I have been to.  He doesn't just give you a pill he gets to the problem.  Between the two of them my health is getting back on track and I am so thankful I have found them.  My husband and I both go here now.  I recommend this place to everyone, even family and friends out of town.
1 I had a 4:30pm appointment and it is now 5:45 and we have not seen the doctor YET. We were told, "The Doctor is running behind you can wait or reschedule." WOW! Meanwhile I see the doctor walking back and forth casually. There aren't any patients in the back or the lobby. Why did you set the appointment if you had no intentions on honoring it? Really sickening and sad. Nevada's healthcare is a joke.
5 Seit einigen Monat ist das Ärzteteam der Praxis Widmaier in die neue, schön eingerichtet Praxis (ein paar Häuser weiter unten in der Bebeslstrasse) umgezogen.    Der Vater (zeitweise, nur für Privatpatienten) und die Geschwister Widmaier sind sehr einfühlsam und kompetent. Ich hatte hauptsächlich mit Frau Dr. Bettina Widmaier zu tun. Kann sie nur wärmstens empfehlen. Auch über die Terminvergabe und die Wartezeiten lässt sich nichts Negatives sagen. Nur das wird sich jetzt wohl ändern, wenn alle dort hin wollen... ;-)
5 I have been a patient at Generations for 8 years. I saw Dr. Jones for the first couple years and still do if Heather Smith is to busy, love them both . If you need a Doctor who cares this is the place to go. Never have, I experience any rudeness or never wait to be seen.
5 Exceptional doctors that are extremely personable and take plenty of time to discuss your issues... Highly recommend Family Practice Specialists!
5 I have been here only for a physical. The staff and Dr Perez are very friendly. Dr Perez listens carefully during the examination, and patient portal makes communication very easy.
5 The staff are so friendly especially Erika and Ana in the front office. They are so helpful! The appointments are very quick and knowledgeable at the same time.
5 It's been 5 years since I've updated my review and I am STILL a patient of Dr.Boor's. This means I've been with him for 10 years! The office is fantastic. I am very critical of doctor's office staff and his office staff are hands down--the BEST. They treat you kindly, call you by name (See my other reviews about pediatricians), and are very professional. In all the years I've been coming to Dr. Boor I have never had to wait more than 10 minutes beyond my scheduled time to see him and even that is  a stretch. They are nearly always right on time whether I've had a long standing appointment or I've been squeezed in due to illness.   In the last 2 years, Del Lago Family medicine has become part of the John C Lincoln health care systems so they are very up on the latest technology and techniques. It's nice to have a doctor who is backed by a major corporation who clearly sees his value.  Dr. Boor himself is an excellent doctor. He is kind, caring, and really listens to what you have to say. He treats both my children as well as my husband and me and he has been a learned friend who takes his role in our health care very seriously. He never talks down to anyone, never tries to treat you before you've finished your sentence, and he never makes you feel like your concerns aren't relevant or important. I never feel rushed when I go to see him and I know he is going to provide us with the best care possible.  He has called me after surgical procedures, even when he isn't the doctor performing the procedure. He follows up when we are sick. He truly does care about his patients.   As a patient for 10+ years, I can tell you that Dr. Boor is the best. I have recommended ALL of my friends and family to him and the vast majority of them see him.
1 How do you describe an urgent care clinic that has no sense of urgency? That leaves your daughter sitting in an exam room forgotten for over an hour?  Visiting from out of town, my daughter had a severe sore throat and inflamed tonsils. After a cursory exam and throat swab, she waited over an hour before coming out and asking what the delay was. "Oh, you're negative for strep". Great, when were you going to get around to telling us?  So a total of 2 1/2 hours wasted at the Piedmont Urgent Care.  No urgency and no care.
1 Let me start by saying that apparently it is our privilege to give our company's hard earned money to HealthWorks. I never made it past the receptionist. She didn't seem to grasp the concept that she works in a for-profit environment. And that the way they make money is by billing our insurance for the office visit and treatment rendered. It is kind of hard to bill for that visit if I never make it to the exam room. I have an old sock at home that has more compassion and customer service skills then this lady. I could go on and on but that's not my style I will simply say I gathered up my paperwork and refused to let my company's money be spent here. I immediately called our division that handles where are industrial claims go and it will soon not be here. I am only posting this on Yelp so others may realize that you still have a choice and you are not a hostage forced to use a service that doesn't care about you. Should you have a similar experience contact your HR department or safety coordinator. Let them know how you were treated here
5 Susie is great! Extremely knowledgeable and intuitive. Do know that the neuromuscular massage is not relaxing @ all and can be quite painful but on the other side of the grimacing and expletives is freedom! Mobility, pain free wonderfulness! Worth every minute and every single penny.
1 This place is horrible, customer service is bad and the doctor wasn't friendly. Also my 10 month old needed X-rays and the first time the nurse forgot to put the radiation. Protector on and took pictures and second time the picture didn't work she said so she had to take more X-rays. It's sad that with no insurance and paying the $40 a month to be seen there with $20 office visits that they would be more Friendly and make their patients feel welcomed
5 I have only good things to say about this place! I have been there for several issues. I was recently treated for a torn cartilage in my knee. I thought I needed surgery. My doctor said to try physical therapy first and it worked, no surgery needed. He told me Heidi is a miracle worker!  Heidi and her team are all very friendly they truly care about your well being. Heidi is very professional and in a kind way. She said something that resonated with me." Don't be afraid of your body." It seems when you hurt something, you become afraid but your body can do amazing things if given a chance.That is very true. I would say give them a chance! I would  highly recommend them. Their hours are great and the place is a very friendly atmosphere not intimidating at all.
5 Best place I've gotten to be at and very attentive with their staff and friendly they really care about your health! And the wait is not long at all they get you started as soon as you walk in
5 Solid family medicine practice. They are a big busy practice but they still manage to make you feel like you are the only patient that matters at the moment. I have been able to get timely appointments for me and my family when needed. I would recommend this practice to anyone looking for a new physician ‍ ‍
5 I was referred by a friend to visit Dr. Hogan. He is so knowledgeable and explains everything extremely well and detailed. His staff is also amazing and does a great job of breaking down everything, whether pricing or perscription. I ended up having to get an mri and have been doing extensive therapy with him and he has predicted perfectly when I would start feeling better. I highly recommend this place because of the personal experience you get that you wouldn't find in most other places. The amount of relief after his adjustments speak for itself.
1 My family and I have been going to this office since 2005. Today I was treated like a criminal for asking for some pain medication due to a dislocated shoulder. I was told by the doctor that since I wasn't her regular patient she wouldn't prescribe anything. She didn't bother to check to see that another doctor there was my primary physician. What a lesson in customer service....I am sure I will not be missed since they are always very busy.
1 called at 11:50 am to make an appointment. i selected option #1 to schedule an appointment. the line was picked up and hung up 3 times.  All of a sudden the three lines i have to the office were all busy.  Who ever is handling the reception desk today September 3, 2014 should be fired.
5 This is one of the best primary care providers I've ever been too. Not only was Dr Carroll thorough in his questioning of the needs or my health, he directed me personally to a specialist and his team even set up the same day ENT appointment for me.  He also was not hesitant to treat aggressively a 6 year ongoing foot issue that other doctors told me to use the OTC Which had no impact for years. I highly recommend Dr. Carroll and his outstanding team. He is also facilitating in resolution of other issues with me, specifically spine and sleep.  Any doctor who tells you I'm hear to guide you through the maze of the healthcare industry and then follows it up is worth keeping and sharing about.
2 Physical therapy was  great from Mike, but was racially harasssed and treated terribly by the other PT. Mike apologized but I am so traumatized that I asked to be referred elsewhere. I miss the rest of the staff but cannot take the disrespect. This is the Summerland office. I am sure the Henderson office is much better.
4 Went here the other day because I smashed my finger in my car door and the whole nail turned purple. I decided to come here because it was close by.  Luckily there was no other patients waiting so I was seen fairly quickly.  The staff besides the front desk girls were pleasant and were attentive to my needs.  The PA, Amanda D was great and very thorough.  The others were just as great too!    I would definitely come back if I needed help and am in the area.  They even called me 2 days later to follow up!  Great patient care for an urgent care facility.  Thanks guys!
2 DVFM DOES NOT ANSWER THEIR PHONES. If they cared about their PATIENTS, not customers, but healthcare patients, in need of serious medical attention, they would address this too common complaint with their office.   I have been suffering from bronchitis and possible pneumonia (per Cheryl Luchsinger) for a week. I have a nagging, itchy cough, body aches, cold chills, profuse sweating, loss of appetite and headache. I CHOSE to drive 40 minutes from my home in San tan valley, AZ in lieu of going to an urgent care facility closer to my home, for treatment because I thought that since DVFM had my medical history, I would receive more PERSONAL and adaptive care. PFFF!  I felt very hopeful when Cheryl said she would treat it like a pneumonia, not just a bronchitis, to be safe. She seemed concerned and I felt at ease. She even made me laugh. I was prescribed an inhaler and antibiotics. I got the inhaler but unfortunately the antibiotics required a PRIOR AUTHORIZATION from my insurance. Walgreens sent the fax at 1:30 pm while I was standing there picking up my inhaler. I have been waiting for DVFM to respond to this request. STILL NO RESPONSE. Walgreens keeps saying to "contact your physician so they can change it or they can call your insurance"... What more can I do if DVFM won't even answer the phone???? Way to put patients first DVFM. Way to go.  I have been going here for a year and a half. My pcp is dr. Lauber. I have just spent the last 24 hours awake with a nasty cough because I cannot sleep. I'm waiting a for Cheryl L the pA to respond to a prior authorization request sent from the Walgreens pharmacy at 1:30 yesterday. Really? Do you or your MA's check the fax machine on a regular basis?? This is not a matter of convenience it IS a matter of wellness for patients.   Operations and policies need to change at DVFM before patients start reporting to the BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU.   ANSWER YOUR PHONES, CHECK YOUR FAX MACHINES. PUT PATIENTS FIRST. Isn't that why you opened your doors?
5 Friendly, competent staff.  Dr was thorough and patient, answering all my questions. Facility in great shape, is newer looking and super clean with happy feel. I'd recommend it. Just be sure to check hours since not open as many days or as long as other Urgent Cares.
1 Absolutely terrible. There are much better places for the money. Thin walls. Terrible receptionist and only email for receipts. Service has gone downhill over the years. Make sure you don't get the main floor room. You will hear everyone as you get your massage. Will never go again!
5 A few months ago I brought my Grandmother in to see Dr. Levins to make some very difficult life decisions...he was such a kind yet direct person and I'm very thankful for him.
1 How UMC got ranked "best" hospital in Vegas and ranked among the top in the nation is beyond me. Pharmacy wait time to drop off scripts is 1+ hours. Filling scripts takes up to 36 hours. Picking up scripts is 2+ hours. Paperwork gets lost. Patients aren't notified. Scripts aren't filled and forgotten about. Scripts that do get filled are returned to the shelf if you don't pick up within their arbitrary time frame which they claim is a week but in reality was less. Wait time for an ultrasound took me 3+ hours and would've taken liner if I didn't complain. Somehow my paperwork got lost between the front desk and 10 feet to the tech. No wonder people self medicate.
5 These professionals are great. They have helped me with back issues. I would refer Emily who works there to anyone. She's all business with her sweetness.  Thanks Em!
5 Great service starting from the front counter, medical assistants and nurse. I left impressed with their level of customer service and care. Karen Steven's, APRN, was absolutely wonderful explaining what was going on with my 4 year old. She was so much fun! I'm so glad and thankful this facility opens until 9:00 p.m.
4 Not sure why so many bad reviews...(I don't work here/know anyone personally who works there or have any reason to give a biased review) I've gone to Dr.Gardner for 2 years and never had a bad experience. Recently went to the Cheyenne location and although the receptionist wasn't the most friendly it wasn't that bad. The ultrasound tech was extremely friendly! The offices are basic, always seemed clean.
5 I was in Physical Therapy for probably way too long after a minor arthroscopic surgery in February on my left knee, but am so grateful to have had the type of insurance that covers it. The knee has healed well, thanks to careful treatment and monitoring by Dr. Anthony (will update with last name after I find it). Anthony is great - knows what he's doing and how to communicate with patients. He did cite the party line, "Running is bad", but seems to know that it's important to me and did not discourage me from trying to run again. Front desk staff is wonderful - very patient with my either showing up at the wrong time or not at all when I had calendar issues. One thing I wish all physical therapists would do, though, is provide patients with a little write-up of the prescribed exercises...
1 I can't rate the Dr because I've been waiting 3 hours and have not seem him yet. After the 6 hour wait, and yes I waited because it took me three months to schedule an appointment, the doctor seemed to very knowledgable unfortunately I will not be seeing him again.
3 Got admitted yesterday at about 6 am er staff and dr. Mishert were great then got moved to the 7th floor and had to wait 10 hours before getting pain meds thank god the er nurse gave me some before I left. Rooms are all single good and bad bad if you're just waiting for hours to get the help you were admitted for. The er staff handles unexpected seizures really well and I learned if you're in extreme pain with seizure history your threshold is low so be careful.
5 Nice place. It's pretty in the waiting area and the staff is great. One staff member, Star, in particular went above and beyond to help me with my pharmacy. There was trouble with my insurance and she assisted them to correct the issue. I would recommend this to patients in the area.
1 My daughter is 8 and has been going to CTC since the age of 3 for PT and OT.  Overall I have been extremely disappointed with the therapy services she receives, as the facility has constant turnover in their staff and are severely understaffed and unable to accommodate all of the kids.  Unfortunately, this facility is the only option that is offered through our insurance plan.  Though my daughters Doctor has recommended a certain amount of therapy, I am now being told by CTC that it is within their right to override his prescription and provide her with less therapy than what is ordered.  It has taken weeks to even get this response from the clinic director (who is part-time I should point out) after two phone calls and an email expressing my concerns.  Bottom line, they are making recommendations for the amount of therapy that a child should receive not based on the Doctors prescription or medical necessity, but rather based on their staffing issues and their bottom line.  If you have a choice of therapy facilities for your child, I recommend that you look elsewhere!
1 I would give no stars if it was an option.  Absolutely the worst customer service ever.  If you like offices that schedule 10 minute appointments and insist on 5 minute follow-up appointments in order to discuss imaging results and doctors that leave all communication to their medical assistants this is the place for you.  I had to call multiple times to get my results.  You could hear the disdain in the medical assistants voice when I asked questions.  Dr. Dean was great (for the whole 10 minutes I saw him) if you can handle dealing with a very unprofessional support staff.  And as a warning, you will never hear from Dr. Dean again.  "Don't let the door hit you in the a$$ on the way out" is the message they send.
5 Clean office with a friendly an inviting environment. The staff is very sweet and organized. Dr. Luis J Lopez was very patient and knowledgeable about all my concerns and questions. This was my first appointment with them and the in-processing paperwork took only a few minutes. I would recommend him to everyone.
5 OMG. Athena is the greatest. Very knowledgeable. They're also having a cool promotion right now for first timers. I'm definitely considering making her my new MT!
1 I am extremely disappointed with the level of service I received from this company.   My primary care physician referred me to Desert Valley Therapy. When I called to schedule my evaluation I was asked to arrive thirty minutes prior to my 9:00 AM appointment to fill out paperwork. I arrived early, as requested, and completed the new patient paperwork within fifteen minutes.  I remained in the waiting room for over an hour. When I was finally seen, I felt the evaluating therapist's time was divided. I was left in a small room, with the curtains drawn for fifteen minutes in the middle of my evaluation, while she tended to another patient.   A week later I returned for my first appointment. After sitting in the waiting room past my scheduled appointment time, I was called back by a therapist along with another patient. The therapist started us both out on hand bikes. A female 'Exercise Specialist' then took over for the therapist. She randomly advised me to do stretches as if I were a returning patient, saying things like, 'Um, go ahead and do your . . . Trap stretches.' I tried to inform her that this was my first appointment and that I was not familiar with the stretches or treatment plan, but she was quite distracted playing a Scrabble-type game on her iPhone with another 'Exercise Specialist.' This went on for the duration of my appointment. I was then returned to the therapist for brief soft tissue manipulation. Throughout my appointment, the staff kept referring to my shoulder. I found this quite confusing, as I not referred to them for anything related to my shoulders.  After discussing the above issues with my physician, I called their office to inquire about filing a complaint. My call was directed to their HR department. I explained my problem to the woman who answered the phone in HR. She was very apologetic and told me that she would take a message for her supervisor, who was on another call. I never received a call back from anyone affiliated with Desert Valley Therapy. Extremely disappointed with the level of service I received, I mailed a letter to their main office on August 24, detailing my concerns and requesting a refund of my co-payments. I requested that they respond by September 10, but have not received a response.
1 Not at all impressed by this DO. She sent me for tons of blood work that came back all over the place- hormones and blood proteins and thyroid all out of whack. Told me to become a vegan immediately, that she COULD NOT help me medically until I stopped eating animal products. I came in especially to a DO for help and looking for someone to pay attention to what is happening to me, she blew me off just like every other Doctor I've been to. If you have a complex illness that needs to be diagnosed and treated DO NOT go to this doctor. I will not be back.
5 Dr. Negin Rabi is a wonderful, caring person who eagerly and enthusiastically treats her patients. The Altima staff are friendly and polite. I highly recommend Altima for anyone having an joint or muscle pain! My neck and shoulder feel much better now. I only wish their location was closer to downtown :-)
1 I was referred here due to a bad lower back with a pinched nerve. I first saw Jessica from her to Kareem, from him to Dr. Abrams. I've had 2 injections with no results. A prescription that doesn't help (so I stopped taking it).I still feel my nerve pinching when I bend, or do any activities. I've gained muscle weakness! They've not once gave or offered another prescription to deal with pain! I've lost my job & the end result was.. Let's do physical therapy/ tense unit "can't do anything else, Good luck & take care of yourself"... Really I want answers and not some half way response!? My total time during my visit with a PA OR DOC was 10-15 mins? I'm so frustrated right now! These guys are a waste of money, time! You spend more time waiting to be seen than with the PA OR DOC. If you truly are worried about your health and in need of help/ answers please look elsewhere!
1 My sister is going to this clinic and the customer service here is the worst I have seen ANYWHERE. The staff will speak over you, hang up on you, and be little you. They do not answer the phone when you call. They do not respond to voicemail. Josue says he is the owner but I doubt it due to the way he speaks to me and my sister. They are negligent and extremely rude. My sister would definitely go to another clinic if there was another LGBT friendly clinic around but is forced to deal with these rude people who always seem like helping her is unconvincing them when it is their job. Due to their negligence she has missed two doses of a very important medication and none of the staff seems to care.
2 Everything has been difficult with Ensign Family Medicine.  Always had to wait months to see Dr. White he is regularly unavailable, regular 10-20 minute phone wait times, Jeaninne (PA) very good, Marianne (PA) we stayed clear of.   We changed providers but are dealing with being re billed for services payed in full.
1 We had been going here for 8 years but no more. While we like Dr T this office staff is ridiculous. They are incompetent at best. My husband was leaving a cardiologist appointment and was going to be 10 to 15 minutes late. I called and they said he couldn't be seen. YET you will usually have to wait a half hour to get in and then another 45 minutes to an hour to see the Dr once they take you back to the room. It just keeps getting worse here. Find another Dr this place is just ridiculous.
5 I see Dr. Rosenstein, M.D. at least monthly and he has been able to efficiently work with my various needs in a comprehensive and caring manner.  His recommendations to specialists have been spot on, helping ailments that my previous primary doctors couldn't solve.    The office helps lessen the need to go elsewhere with its own in-house X-Ray, Ultrasound Equipment and more.   One also doesn't have to wait too long to see the doctor.    The staff is very efficient.  If you experience challenges with your pharmacy, they make it easy and will relay your message to his doctors' assistant to solve any issues, usually the same day.
5 Had my first appointment with Dr. Susan Sorosky this week. All of the staff is exceptionally friendly and the appointment was set up to fit my schedule.   I had the e-mail for the patient portal and all notes by the next day to myself as well as my other doctors and all imaging has already been set up.  I know what all the potential next steps are, and feel comfortable with everything.  Granted this is step one but I have no reason to believe it will change.
5 Today was my first visit to Aveon Health and I have never felt so well cared for at any other doctor before. I called early this morning and they got me in for a 9:30 appointment with one of the Physicians Assistants, I believe her name was Chantelle. I came in and was called back before I could even finish filling out my new patient paperwork (they provide an iPad for you to fill out the forms electronically). Normally I have to wait a half hour or more after my scheduled appointment time to see my other doctors. I was very grateful to learn they are committed to their patients and respectful of their time. The nurses who took me back were extremely kind and helpful. They offered to give me my flu shot while I was waiting for the doctor so that saved me another trip and I've been meaning to get my flu shot for a while. Then the doctor came in and listened to me, truly listened to all of my concerns and answered all of my questions. She spent a good amount of time with me examining everything she needed to and provided what I needed to get better. She also took the time to tell me about her background and the company. She asked me when was the last time I had a physical (and it's been years) so she got me scheduled for one. She truly cared about my overall health. I am very happy with Aveon Health and will continue to go there for my primary care. Highly recommended to anyone especially those seeking a family doctor! 5 stars all around!
5 Rarely do you encounter any healthcare provider where every single person who works there is competent and cares about the client. So very impressed with Angie Christopher and her entire staff at this business and the level of care that I get every time I am there.   I have moved on from chiropractic care to being a patient of Dr. Stone because we have discovered that my back pain is a result of a degenerated disc. I will be undergoing a nerve ablation procedure with Dr. Stone in the near future and I am confident he will be able to provide some well needed relief!  I would enthusiastically recommend this business to anyone with chiropractic needs or physical therapy needs, and a whole range of other well-being services that they offer.
5 I've been to a lot of physical therapy facilities and I never felt that my issues were addressed effectively. Here the physical therapists are exclusively with you during your time. I had neck surgery and I can really trust Daniel Vilaubi to help me getting better. I can feel the improvement after each session. Having pain is a nightmare and I really appreciate the dedication in helping me overcome it.
1 The wait times at this facility are HORRENDOUS. You can count on it being a minimum of TWO HOURS in the waiting room and 30 plus minutes once you're brought back. The front office staff is incompetent. They have no idea how to schedule the patients, nor do they care. I even waited over an hour to get my blood drawn. Who runs a business this way? By the time you get to see your doctor, you're so angry with the wait time, all you want to do is get out of there as quickly as possible. I can no longer stand the frustration of this place and will not be returning for any reason. Somebody needs to pay attention to these comments and DO SOMETHING about their office staff. One suggestion: have a sign-in sheet ready on the counter so people aren't standing around waiting until SOMEBODY gets off the phone to check them in. How inefficient can you possibly be?
1 Terrible, terrible Dr. I can't believe this guy is in health care. I went to this man because I have crappy insurance and I had very few options to choose from. I expressed to this man that I have had stomach issues for a very long time and that I am becoming concerned. I also told him that another Dr that I had seen wanted me to get some tests done for MS. Dr. Aking sent me to a general surgeon and neither myself or the surgeon knew exactly why I was there. The surgeon wrote a letter to Dr. Aking expressing his concern about my stomach issues and Dr. Aking still has not sent me in for any testing. I called my other Dr who wanted me to get tested for MS but needed Dr. Aking to write the referral to a neurologist or to get an MRI.  Dr. Aking STILL has not followed up on any of this. I have called him several times, days, weeks in a row and have talked to the office manager. She keeps saying that he is busy. I finally got him to get on the phone with me and he said he would look in to these 2 separate issues and get me a referral and send me in for testing. Two months later I still don't have either one of those and my problems persist. Even with a letter from the surgeon and all of my medical records being sent to him to review, he has made no effort to help me get better or to see what is going on. I try on a regular basis to get help from this office and it only falls upon deaf ears.  He is awful! The front office is lazy and unprofessional as well. If you are looking for a good Dr, then keep on looking! The wait in the office took forever to be seen and when he finally gets in there he was more concerned about my tattoos than the actual reason why I was in there. I would like to file more complaints on this Dr because of all of this. He is absolutely pathetic!
5 Thank you Jolly!! Highly recommended!! Colonix is a MUST. Very professional and clean facility..
5 Went to my first appointment today and I can't say enough, how friendly and helpful the staff and PT's were. Wade made sure to do a full evaluation and found more than what my doctor saw as far as lack of range in certain areas which he feels could be why I have the pains I have at times. He didn't overload me with "homework" for my first day which is nice. It really helps me feel like they want me to succeed and build my strength up the right way and not just go through the motions! Glad I found them!
5 Got an 80 min hot stone from Kimberly. I knew she was gonna have her work cut out for her because of all the tension that's built up. She managed to work so much out while allowing me to relax!! Spectacular massage. Highly recommend her.
5 A very clean facility! The staff made us very comfortable for my father. Unfortunately he passed, he was very sick before coming into the facility, but he was comfortable and now he's at peace.
1 My cardiologist, who is excellent, is part of this corporation at another branch on La Canada Street. I think he's great. But if his nurse Janice is an indication of how this group is run, the corporation is not. Five months after suffering a heart attack, I was still sleeping up to 16 hours a day. It was difficult to work or accomplish anything. I remembered that the pharmacy insert for one of my meds said tiredness was a side effect and if it continued, patients should contact the doctor. When I called, the nurse insisted that fatigue was not a side effect of my meds, and I should see a primary care physician. She refused to even give a message to the doctor. I ran out of a med, and because I order meds online because the pharmacies in Las Vegas are so poor, it took several days to get it. While I was out of the med, I didn't sleep during the day. I looked at the pharmacy insert for that med, and sure enough, it was the med that had tiredness as a side effect. Nurses are not doctors and should not be giving medical advice. Certainly, they should not function as a gatekeeper that blocks patients from leaving messages with doctors. They are not qualified to do so, nor do I think their license grants them that authority. I am seeing my cardiologist this Friday and will tell him what his nurse did. But if this is what is allowed by this corporation, patients are taking their lies in their hands to seek care here.
5 Ive had physic at three different facilities over the years and these guys are great. I would recommend. On the subway and streetcar line. Parking is limited to nearby side streets but there is a lot down the street at loblaws.
5 Succeed Pt is a great clinic for all ages. Jim and Bill have a knack for welcoming and developing personal connections with all their patients. They are both incredibly knowledgeable about knee and shoulder injuries but by no means are their skills limited to such. I recently had a knee surgery that requires a 14 month rehab and there is no other place I'd trust to run me through my flow. Thanks Jim and Bill!
5 I cannot say enough awesome things about this place. After a whole year of battling lower back pain I'm FINALLY feeling like a functioning human again after only 4 short weeks thanks to the amazing team at BackFit.  Each and every employee takes the time to get to know you and your needs and I actually enjoy spending my lunch breaks with such awesome people.   I was referred here by a friend of mine who had an amazing experience as well. If you're looking for a chiro- look no further this is your place.
3 I would, without hesitation, give Mayo Arrowhead Family Medicine a 5+ star rating. Their doctors are the best ever.  In our entire lives, we have never had such phenomenal or attentive care.  HOWEVER, if you are on Medicare and purchase pricey supplements so that you may stay with the incredible Mayo system, STAY AWAY!  They opted out of Medicare 3 years ago, so purchasing the priciest supplemental policy you could find will not help you.  Did we sign a consent form agreeing to this? Probably.  Did we understand what we were signing OR was there further explanation that our visits would no longer be covered....NO!  As we watched our bills grow, and through several phone calls to their central billing system over the past 4 months, it was just today that a supervisor finally asked us "Are you aware that Arrowhead Mayo opted out of Medicare 3 years ago and will not cover your office visits?" She further explained that of the 3 Mayo family practice clinics in AZ, they are the ONLY one who won't accept Medicare.  Needless to say, we are sickened by their policy and will have to seek medical care elsewhere.
5 Dr Steve has really made an impact on the quality of my life since i began regular adjustments about a year ago,  no more back  or knees pain! Most importantly for me is how quick i can get in and out and on with my day. I highly recomend Dr Steve and global chiropractic!
5 Loving my doctor...he actually listens to what I have to say and together we decided a plan that's best for me...thank you Dr. Hailstone!
5 I have always been a big believer in cold therapy for relief of pain and for faster recovery from any type of injuries. Scottsdale cryotherapy takes that to a whole new level. Every time I leave I feel so energized and ready to tackle the world. Angelo is a one of a kind therapist and is amazing at pinpointing the problem areas. If you are looking for relief from stress, pain, or ongoing injuries Scottsdale cryo is going to be a game changing experience!
5 Place is very nice what you would expect from a concierge Dr. he is awesome caring  funny and just a down to earth great DR. the Staff is AMAZINGLY wonderful wouldn't change  this Dr. and sooooo worth it its nice to be able to txt My Dr. and the Staff time is Valuable !!!
5 Dr. Khakwani saved my life.  True Story.  I went in to see Dr. Khakwani with what I thought was a urinary track infection.  The symptoms I experienced were the need to pee every two hours.   He immediately put me on medication but at the same time ordered blood work for diabetes and tumor marker CA-125.  Simultaneously he ordered a pelvic and trans-vaginal ultra sound.   The blood work came back within a week as negative for a tumor.  But the ultra sound showed a growth in my right ovary.  He immediately referred me to an Gynocological-Oncologist who confirmed the growth as a cancerous tumor.  Within two weeks of seeing Dr. Khakwani, I was in surgery.  My cancer is a very rare form of Ovarian Cancer and is usually found in later stages because the symptoms are hard to diagnose.  Thanks to Dr. Khakwani's swift action, I am diagnosed as Stage 1A.    Dr. Khakwani is knowledgeable and is not hesitant to order the necessary tests. He spends the time with you to ask questions, thoroughly explain treatment, and orders the necessary tests.  I feel very lucky to have Dr. Khakwani as my Primary Care Physician.  And I believe that his swift action saved my life!  If this story didn't convince you, I also recommend his office for convenience.  His office is affiliated with the Urgent Care next door.  If you need to visit the Urgent Care and you are his patient, you don't have to fill out any paperwork for the visit.  It's all very streamlined and convenient!
2 Doug and Julie are both great. Easy to get appointments, but the office staff are not helpful and unfriendly.
5 This is the only urgent care center that I trust at this point. I have now been here three or four times and while I've always driven over with a slight sense of dread wondering about the wait and how attentive the care will be, I always leave lighthearted knowing I made a good choice. The front desk employees are kind and welcoming and all of the doctors I've seen so far have been incredibly knowledgeable and more than ready to answer my questions. I've been to urgent care places all over Tempe and I confidently hang my hat on this one.
1 I went in for a wellness exam. Told the person that I had been sick for 3 weeks, I couldn't keep any food and barely water down, and had lost a significant amount of weight. Blood work and an ultrasound was recommended. Blood work was complete on 9/11 and ultrasound was complete on 9/12.  No contact from this office at all. I had to call them on 9/15 to find out if they knew anything, what the next step was, I am still in pain.  I was told that they were waiting on the provider to sign off on the results so they could contact me. I explained the seriousness of the situation and was told that they would try to get it signed off and needed me to come in to get the results. I was told that they close at 3pm and would need to be there by 2:15 to get seen.  I told them that I would not make it in time and can I have my results over the phone, I said that I know I need to see a GI specialist, is the doctor recommending that, can we please get that started because I am not doing any better.  I was told that they would call me back.  Two hours later, I receive a phone call regarding my results but I still needed to come in to see the doctor. Was told I could come in on Saturday but it was first come first serve. Went in Saturday morning and met with this doctor. Told him I was in horrible pain, I had lost 7 more pounds since Monday, still was not able to keep any food and fluids down, and I was extremely dehydrated.  The doctor wanted me to go see a GI and prescribed some mild pain pill and something for acid reflux.  This location actually has a GI on site and when I tried to make the appointment, they lady said she needed to find out what type of ultrasound the doctor wanted done but he was with another patient and I could wait or she would call me when she found out. I told her I was in alot of pain can she please call me so we can schedule it. Never got a phone call even though I left 3 messages! I had to go to the ER because I was so dehydrated, that's not fair that I have to pay for an ER visit when I asked this doctor to be hydrated.  On Monday, 9/18, I missed work due to pain and called around to find the soonest availability for a GI. I found one that could see me the next day. Still no word from this clinic. Finally today, 9/20, I get a call regarding my referral. The lady says they referred me to the Arizona Digestive Health, I told her that they did not, I found her on my own because they never got back to me. All she said was that she would let the provider know. I don't want anything to do with this clinic, I am switching primary care doctors asap and I don't want this clinic to have anything to do with my situation ever again.  This clinic just called my girlfriend back with her lab results today and she also went in on 9/11/2017 with me. How does it take a week and a half to get result back or to hear back from this clinic? No information has been updated on our Aetna member page regarding our visit to this clinic but my visit yesterday is already showing up!  This place is a joke and I feel that they did not take my situation seriously!!
5 Best doctor I have ever been to hands down! I was afraid to go to the doctor because I currently do not have health insurance. He took all my worries away immediately. He was kind and compassionate, he actually took the time to explain to me what I was feeling and why. He also took the time to educate me on how to get better. I can't put into words how amazing Dr. Sharma is. I literally started to cry of happiness when he made me feel like he really understood what I was feeling. Don't look for any other doctor just go to trails family medical. If you want to be cared for and have someone take their time on you, go here! My life is changed because of him and I'm forever grateful for all that he's done for me.
1 OMG STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE! now that Dr Stacie is gone this place is worse then any other I've been to in 8 years here. IF you can get the front desk staff on the phone good luck getting any information from them without it sounding as though your asking them for their personal bank information! Apts take forever to schedule, and they tell you you can just walk in but the wait time is on average two hours!  Looks like I'll be taking my healthcare to Cali!   Anyone know what happens to our records?? I'd like to get mine and get out!
1 I have had 3 appointments here. I'd like to give it no stars. The front desk is very unprofessional. The wait times are excessive. I was there today only a couple minutes early, instead of my usual 20 minutes early for appointments. I did this because of how long I wait before an MA takes me back(I could write a full page just about the MA's). I was there for an annual pap smear today. Already it's an embarrassing and vulnerable situation. The doc asks all the same questions she asked in the other appointments. You'd think the answers would already be in my chart... This is my 3rd appointment here in the last 7 weeks! She asks about birth control. When I tell her I'm not on any she looks at me like I'm retarded. I was treated like a 13 year old girl instead of a 31 year old woman! When she finally got that she wasn't going to get to shove hormones down my throat she said "so if you are going to continue to use natural form of birth control just don't get pregnant!" I don't need a sex ed lesson! I haven't taken hormones for 10 years! And besides that, I'm getting married in May and will try to get pregnant in June. This is why I'm seeing this Doc. This is why My appointments have been so close together! So let me set the scene! I was in a paper vest and a paper blanket to cover my lower half. She says "so if you're going to continue to use natural form of birth control, just don't get pregnant!". I stopped her, I said excuse me? She says "what? Just don't get pregnant." as she shrugs her shoulders I said that's really rude, you're very rude, I think I'd like to leave. She tried to say that it's her job as my Doc to give advise about this stuff. I said that wasn't advise, I'm 31 not 13 and you dont know me and you didn't ask what my plans are. That's very rude of you to assume. No appology, this is what I got "All I said was be carefull without birth control, because you can get pregnant." I said that's not at all what you said and I'm leaving I got off the table and grabbed my clothes. Before I could even get them on she's opened the door and is standing in the door continuing to argue with me. She even tried to turn it around " you should leave! You were here 45 minutes late and I was nice enough to take you!" Fully nude argument with a Doc holding the door open! I'm a very modest person, and it's very hard to say all of this in such a public way. But I would like to save others from having this kind of experience. I think I can safely say it is THE worst experience I've had with health care "professionals".
1 If I could give 0 stars I would. Worst possible place to send even your enemies. It feels like none of the people here know what they're doing. My uncle was left waiting upon admission. And then several hours later, was given meds he DIDNT need without checking his charts first. He asked for some food, it arrived 2 hours later. Needless to say, he left and just got a private nurse to help him at home. RUN THE OTHER WAY FROM THIS PLACE!
5 After being tossed around in my office in the skies and being injured in severe turbulence , I find myself here. Not how I envisioned spending my winter but nonetheless anything to avoid spinal injections , (OUCH?) and/or surgery. I found this place a pleasant surprise in my new neighborhood,(I'm still missing my Biltmore area!). It's small and not overwhelming with too many clients. My PT therapist is thorough and very sweet. In other words, she doesn't put me in more pain! The office staff is friendly and never in a rush to shoo you out if you have questions. I'm also loving the fact that I get massages for therapy!
1 If I could give this rating 0 stars I WOULD. AWFUL. To start, my very first visit I was told to sit in a room and watch a video. I didn't think it was the worst thing since it was probably about how the spine works and what not. WRONG. I was forced to sit and watch a video about how much "everyone" recommends and loves Dr. Steven. This should have been my first clue, RUN. However, I was in pretty bad shape and needed attention. I hurt my back exercising and it never recovered. Anyways, Dr. Steven told me that my spine was out of line and it was curved too much towards the bottom creating spaces in my disc's which caused discomfort. He proceeded to tell me I would need treatment 4 times a week for 8-10 weeks. ARE YOU KIDDING ME. I thought no way. So I decided that I would see him twice a week. Granted an adjustment will make a lot of people feel better and it did for a week or so but it didn't really fix the problem. I would go in for my $50 appointment and he would adjust by back and that was it. $50 for all of 3 minutes. He told me on my fist day he had exercises I could do and he never once said anything about that. I even asked him about doing a reevaluation but I had to wait 8 weeks for that.  I then started to think this guy wasn't doing anything for me and I contacted another doctor. I had Dr. Steven sent an X-Ray report to my new doctor..... My new doctor asked me if I had read the report and I said no. I then read the report and guess what... THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH MY BACK AND IT WAS NOT OUT OF LINE. This doctor is unethical and an embarrassment to doctors all over. IT makes me sick he charged me all that money for having nothing wrong with me. Since then, I saw a new doctor that I only had to see for a week and a half and the pain in gone. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!!! THIS DOCTOR IS A JOKE AND THIS FACILITY SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN.
5 I'm a little surprised by some of the bad reviews. We received excellent care in a timely manner. The PA was knowledgeable and friendly. Maybe waited 10 minutes, saw the PA, got my prescription and went on my way. Best case scenario when you're not feeling well.
1 I am reviewing the pediatric AZOPT and it was in 2010-2011 that I had a child receive therapy here. My child was an early preemie and got sick very easily, running high temperatures all winter long his first year. It was a hard, stressful time and he had both physical and occupational therapy once a week...but he would spike temps of 102-104 degrees and I always would call the office to leave a message if he was too sick. I ended up getting a nasty call from Teri...would they rather I bring a child with a fever and expose other children??? After that I noticed that I would get the rude silent treatment from both the receptionist and very obvious snobby treatment from Josh. I was a few minutes late once and I apologized to the therapist profusely...and around the corner Josh whispered something to her and she whispered back, "But its not like she was a half-hour late!" This was not the first time I heard Josh, Teri and other therapists there gossiping about parents. And according to the speech therapist my son was seeing, other parents also told her about how rude they were treated, even being called ghetto as well (it was a Hispanic mom who didn't speak English well but understood it). I did notice that some parents and kids were treated better than others and it was obvious there was a cliquey attitude there, but I just ignored it and figured as long as my son was getting therapy I can handle it. However, the last straw came when we walked in, my son was toddling  happily and Josh, the therapists and receptionists who were standing around the lobby looked at him like he was an alien. No hello, nothing, just frowning at him. They had some Halloween goodies for the kids and made a big show of giving them out, but very pointedly didn't give one to my child. I know that seems petty but considering all the negativity I had had it...be rude to me and I can take it like an adult, treat my sweet innocent little boy like he's a subhuman....forget it. I went home, called his DDD caseworker, told her the story and that I was absolutely done with AZOPT. I called them and told them that we would no longer be clients, the snippy receptionist said, "Fine" and hung up. We now go to Wee Care and love the therapists and friendly positive atmosphere there (yay for George!). I noticed the building that AZOPT was in was up for lease (my doctor's office is across the parking lot)....maybe they moved but I wonder if they just didn't run off most of their clientele. I know I made sure the DDD knew how rude and unpleasant they were. Glad to have seen the last of that place.
5 I was recently involved in a MVD that resulted in herniations of my neck and lower back. I received prompt and immediate care. The care I received from the staff, Carla, Lori, Liz and Joel was superb. I felt immediate relief from intense pain and discomfort. The following visits were just as good and catered to my individual needs. The office staff and providers offered more than adequate information on my care, appropriate exercise plans and continued care, to ensure my speedy recovery. I have recommended the Glendale Back in Action Therapy office to my friends and family, along with several sports teams that i previously played for. If you suffer from any musculoskeletal ailment please visit my friends at this office, and get answers and the relief you need.
3 This place is okay I guess but every time I go there (not often) it looks more and more run down. We've only gone here for very basic things (x-ray to ensure something's not broken, UTI, one time I went bc I got jalapeno juice in my eye (corneal abrasion)) and the care has been quick and accurate. One time I had a billing problem but they gave me the # for the main billing office. I called and the problem was resolved right away. So I'm giving it a 3/5 (average) mainly because the place is lackluster and doesn't always look very clean, taken care of.
4 Dr. Tsai gets five stars.  His receptionist gets two.  I found Dr. Tsai on Yelp and based on the reviews expected a short wait time.  We scheduled the day before for a 9am appointment.  At 9:30, when the terse receptionist called my husband up to pay his co-pay, he asked how much longer we'd be waiting.  His receptionist said, "about 30 minutes."  I asked how they could be running an hour late when they had just opened 30 minutes ago.  Her response, "the doctor was delayed by one of OUR patients."  (Emphasis hers).  It was our first time at the office, but I thought, Well, what am I?  No apology, no informing us that he was running so late when we first got there.    I was not at all impressed, but then we met Dr. Tsai.  He is kind, compassionate, takes his time, listens and as the others have stated, is conservative with his protocols.  He just needs a different front office girl.
5 I first started going to Synergy in 2016 after I had back surgery.  Though I did not go through post-surgery rehab at Synergy, they treated me at Honor Health Rehabilitation Hospital and I had follow-up wellness check-ups after I was discharged.  During my check-up's, I complained of right shoulder pain.  Amy ordered an MRI of my right shoulder which found my rotator cuff was torn, along with my bicep tendon.  We tried Occupational Therapy to avoid surgery and all was going well until I decided to workout at the gym.  I managed to detach my bicep tendon.  Now I had to have surgery (should have listened to my therapist).  6 Weeks after surgery, I started OT which my doctor prescribed 6 weeks, 3 times a week.  Well, needless to say I was discharged only 4 weeks into OT.  My therapists (Melissa and Emily) did such a great job I was able to complete my therapy early.  Their knowledge and expertise gave me the confidence I needed to succeed.  I also listened to them this time!!!  Everyone at Synergy is very friendly and the atmosphere is up-beat, which helps with motivation.  Thanks Synergy!!!
5 It is hard to find enough superlative words to say about David. He has worked with my parents for over a year.  He is extremely well qualified, professional, and a skilled master at providing purposeful techniques to make the body the best it can be.  But he provides so much more. He makes them smile as they deal with the difficult physical challenges facing 89 year old bodies. David is encouraging, up beat, optimistic, and reassuring, yet realistic. His skillful guidance has helped them improve their daily living. He is kind, accepting, and passionate about his work and the person he works with. He is intuitive in knowing what their bodies can do and guides them to  accomplish more than they thought they could.  His treatments relieved my Mom's chronic back pain, when no drugs or shots could.  He believes in you and David provides the most important therapy tool of all, hope.
1 When I had my visit, I waited two hours to see my doctor. The MA tried to keep me informed which was nice... But her approximations of when I would be seen continued to be inaccurate. When the doctor saw me she apologized for the long wait and gave me what I went their for my medication refills (insurance changed so had to switch here as a first time patient)... Then more inconvenience started they tried to tell me I need to come in for Labs and my blood work results. I KNOW lab work can not be done over the phone, but cultures can. The only reason why the receptionist gave me the over the phone was because I stated this fact. Then my bc refill was denied by my insurance. Called the office let them know I need a prior Auth and that they need to call my insurance company... They didn't, sent a prior Auth. Told them again that they need to have specific reasoning why I can not take generic. THEN after 3 weeks of trying to get this handled... I'm told I need to come in for ANOTHER appointment for her to write I get nauseous... REALLY?! NO. ABSOLUTELY NO. I instead went through my old work and they got it processed immediately. In the past working in a doctors office, this is the absolute worst customer service I've ever dealt with. Avoid at all costs.
5 Dr. Matt Missiha is so amazing at what he does. He takes the time to get to know you and develop a treatment plan that is right for you. He provides excellent service and gives knowledge on how to prevent future injuries. I went to him for bad lower back pain and he took to time to diagnose what was causing it (poor posture and sitting all day). The treatment he provided definitely resolved the issue and the knowledge and exercises he gave me as helped prevent future injuries.  I would recommend visiting MCM Toronto Rehab and working Dr. Missiha to resolve any joint or muscle pain you may be experiencing. He is knowledgeable, friendly and makes you feel safe with what he is doing.
1 Need to find a new physician. The scheduling is atrocious. I've had to wait for over a month to be seen, when scheduling my next appt they said the wait would be over three months just for a routine physical.. Other times, I would arrive at the time scheduled and not be seen for another hour or two. Most atrocious was the time I explicitly said I needed a medication that was safe to consume while breastfeeding and pregnant and was prescribed a pill that my OBGYN said was harmful for the baby and possibly stunts growth.
1 Honestly I'm pretty pissed I got referred to schedule with dr. Benjamin chan. Other doctors I've went to have been able to pinpoint and help me out. When I requested a gall bladder functionality test he flat out said no. I know it's rare but it occurs to women at this age. I believe he kind of doesn't care because I'm just a young woman, but I'm infuriated with the amount of time and money lost dealing with dr. Benjamin chan. I'll be looking elsewhere for another PCP if this issue occurs, which it currently is.
5 Dr. Boothe, is fantastic!!! I really have never been a fan of chiropractors BUT, Brandon has forever changed my mind. I was suffering from sciatica pain. and within 4 treatments cured. He is the best! Awesome personally, thoughtfulness and gentle doctor I have ever seen. Thank you Brandon
5 I have been very satisfied with the care that I have received from Dr. Pope at Shiland Family Medicine or any of the other doctors/staff who have helped me, even when I call in. I recommend this medical office to anyone who asks.
4 I have been going to this office for around 4 years. I like that they are open 7:30-8 most days and are even open on Saturdays. I also really like that they have an online portal. My favorite thing about this office is you can get blood drawn in office. I don't love that you pretty consistently have to wait an hour, even though you have an appointment. However, you can get appointments last minute easily. Which is obviously really nice when you are sick. The staff members are pretty consistent with typical doctors offices. Some of them are nice. But the staff changes, so you never can tell. Doctor Brown is a good doctor. I trust her and that's really important. She takes good care of you, which is why I am willing to wait so long for appointments. I overall would recommend this office. It's clean, professional, etc.
5 Great doctor's office.  Dr. Smith was patient and took his time gathering my history.  The front office and billing staff are great as well. Quick appointments and quick calls back.
1 I was so excited when I found them online...went to see them and found out I had no testosterone...was so excited that an answer had finally been found...got pellets and after 5 weeks I started feeling like myself for the first time in 6 years...however, after 2 weeks, I just keep getting worse and worse...have had 3 or 4 pellet implants and am barely able to get off the couch anymore...sent a friend here and she says for the first time in her life, she is now depressed...their staff is like a revolving door...I am always getting calls saying the person I had an appt with no longer works there...when I finally met Dr. Derosa for a procedure, she told her medical asst that she couldn't discuss any of my symptoms with me because insurance would not cover it...I am a nurse and I have never had another doctor say these words to me...I feel bad for all the other people she has done this to...she is obviously in this for the money!! I have never written a review but am hoping to save whoever I can from this. I  have since heard great things about another place and will now seek them for help!! Everyone has to find out for themselves...but I did warn you!!
5 I was referred to SpineScottsdale by my neurologist for chronic head and neck pain.  The staff (Emily, Gina and Brittany) are very friendly and I was always taken in for my appointments on time.  I didn't know what to expect and Shane (the Physical Therapist)  explained all the movements, step by step and I could tell I was in very good hands.  At first my pain levels went up and down but Shane was reassuring and I continued to follow his instruction.  I have completed my series of treatment and am happy to say I feel it has been successful!!  I no longer have pain everyday the way I used to. I'm am very grateful to Shane and know you will be too!
2 Disliked it. I went in for two appointments to give them a try. The office is nice, and the staff is very professional and courteous. Really, the staff was my favorite part of the whole experience.  The wait times are longer than I am used to. Most chiropractors in my experience don't make you wait more than 3-5 minutes, here I waited about 10 minutes for both of my visits.  I did not feel like I received the attention I needed. I know my body very well, and I know where my issues are. A good indicator for me is how well chiropractors can find them and mention them to me in my first one or two visits. Other chiropractors in the area did a much better job in finding my "bad" spots. My neck adjustments were initiated from the head. What I mean by that is they "whip", or rapidly turn, the head to adjust your neck. I prefer it when adjustments are more controlled.  Yes, everyone is very friendly. However, it does have a rather strong "business" vibe. Not that there is anything wrong with running a nice office or being successful. However, to me, it felt like I did not get enough attention or that I really mattered as a patient. Also, they offered me a 2 month care plan for X dollars and X dollars off if I signed up today. That I did not like at all. Again, nothing wrong with offering care packages, I do believe chiropractic care is a part of a healthy life, but I did not like how it was done.
5 I've had 2 knee surgeries and a shoulder surgery, and I can't say enough good things about how well I was treated at Sports Fyzical therapy.  Scott Pensivy is the best physical therapist. He can diagnose any problem. I recently just went in because of recurring headaches, and after he did PRRT, I feel great.
1 This is the worst urgent care: I've been here almost 2 hrs. We had 2 patients in front of us only and 1 of them left. Still waiting for my daughter to get an X-ray on her finger. No on apologized for the wait. Patients have been coming and going. So annoying and unprofessional..
5 Great atmosphere and inviting staff. Everyone is friendly and professional. Definitely recommend.
5 I love the place. I moved to the west end of the city and still venture here for my spa time. Great service, various options and heated large massage tables. I usually have my legs hanging off and cold at other clinics. Not here....warm, comfy, relaxed and enjoyable. I'm trying acupuncture next.
5 From the moment I first spoke with Dr. Brendon Gibb I knew that I was dealing with an extremely special person. I'm a twenty something year old. I walked into his office in basketball shorts and sandals, unshaven and donning some unflattering bed head. I felt that my appearance may hinder his level of effort with my particular situation. It did not. From the beginning I was treated like his own son.   Just holding a conversation with him is intense. You can see the passion and belief that reside in every fiber of his being. I've only met two other people that share the same piercing gaze that Dr. Gibb has. One, a world renowned colon hydrotherapist and the other an independent filmmaker. The common theme within all these people is that they truly feel that through their work they can change the world.   Our first conversation was extremely thorough about everything that was going on with my health and how it was interconnected. He truly made me believe that he sincerely cares about each and every patient and more than that, every person. Over the course of a month, Dr. Gibb has inspired me to stop countless bad habits (And has me laughing the whole time). Whereas when I would try to stop a bad habit previously I would only do so because I knew it was bad for me. I did not stop the habit because I didn't like doing it, because I did. Through nothing more than some brief conversations and adjustments Dr. Gibb helped me become more in touch with myself which led to me realizing that I am exponentially happier when I am not involved in those old bad habits. Moreover, he has inspired me to constantly work to achieve greatness in everything I do. I can't stress enough how much of an inspiration he is. He's a chiropractor, life coach, doctor, and your best friend all rolled into one.   I've had only one other chiropractor in the past and he was GREAT. The one thing he was lacking was that feeling that you get from Dr. Gibb. The feeling that he wants to help us so much, and more so, for us to help ourselves.
5 I bought a WBWH Groupon a few months ago and the app notified me that it was about to expire. I called to Schedule an appt and gotten squeezed in the same day, which was amazing!! Any way, I walked in and I gotten the most positive attitude with, Julie. She was just phenomenal and impressed how the WBWH staff really do care for the peoples health and weight loss journey. The body wrap was an unexpected wonder experience, EVER! After watching an awesome show on their Netflix account; while I was burning 1k calories I finished my 60 min session I gotten up and felt so confident and sexy. I couldn't get enough so I purchased their 8 pack September deal for ONLY $99!!!!! That's freaking amazing. I adore this place and I am going to buy more when I get paid next week. I love that I could add this to my fitness/ healthy life style. LOVE YOU WBWH fam!
5 Somewhere between Kathleen's charm, Cody's humor, Riley's quick wit, Jessica's determination, and Nick's professionalism I completely forgot I was actually at Physical Therapy, let alone in pain.  Every single staff member here is professional, knowledgeable, and timely. The treatment I received here could not have been better.  I have taken numerous business cards to pass around to family who have been in pain for the majority of their retirement and I hope they come in to see this outstanding team.  Physical Therapy can be stressful and possibly painful, but when you enter these doors you feel nothing but healing and positivity.  Don't wait around call today and get moving/feeling better!
1 7 months after I wrote this review, I received the following email.  I have now redacted the name of the Massage person.  I am only doing this because she does not work there any longer.  I knew at the time of the reivew that they were a new establishment and was hoping that management would contact me regarding this.  THEY DID NOT.  I am not in the business of trying to ruin someones career or have a bad reputation follow them around.  So I have now removed the name of the masseuse that I saw there.  I am posting the email that I just received from her:  "Hi Stephanie, I am so sorry that your experience with me was so dis tastful.  I was out of line to ruin the massage by talking and going on and on while you were trying to relax.   Though it hurts my feeling and is so embarrassing, I am grateful to have your honesty.  But could  I ask that you please consider a few things.   I have not worked at Massage haven in over 6 months, this hurts my reputation in the massage field as well as me personally.   The owners are really nice and it is a new business, so if you could consider them as well, I know if you talk to Susan or Cerey about your experience, they would do anything to make it right for you.   So I'm asking you, please take this down.   I understand your frustration, but please understand how much damage this can do to me.  If I could change the past, I would, but all I can do is so sorry again for the bad experience and I hope you go back there and get a wonderful relaxing massage.  Sincerely,   XXX"
5 The massage I got here was very good!!! Very professional and the technique was great!!! I was able to enjoy it the whole time and 60 minutes was gone fast!!!! I would go back if I got a chance...
1 I have been receiving chiropractic care for over 20 years- I am looking for a new Dr. in Charlotte... and the search continues. My first visit was like stepping into a chaotic locker room. The staff was engaged in loud conversation and joking- mostly about needing a sugar fix. My insurance information was read LOUDLY across the room. All of which, I consider private details. No X-rays were taken or asked for; people can be SERIOUSLY injured or worse without them! Why I didn't leave them I do not know. I let Dr. Brad Weiss adjust me. His quiet room and adjustment were reassuring, but my doubts about the sincerity in their wellness philosophies and care returned when I called the office weeks later when my back went out. Four phone calls and five hours later- I received no response about a possible appointment.  Perhaps if the front office had been more professional, if the doctor had consulted  x-rays, if private information had been better protected, and counsel had been offered when it was needed most, I would be leaving a very different review. But this office was nearly as bad as The Joint (the fast food chain of chiropractic care) where I was forced to turn when my  doctor went radio silent.
5 Dr. Boothe is the BEST!  After years of chronic pain he was able to identify the root cause and successfully treat me. He is such a genuine, kind person and really cares about his patients.  He has helped me so much. I schedule regular appointments to maintain my health. Thanks so much Dr. Boothe!
5 I can say nothing but good things about dr. Dedinksky and his staff. They are like no other dr that you normally go to. Their service is excellent. Easy to get appointments, get a hold of them and great central location. I would highly recommend them as your family dr.
1 Hard to make appointment and the staff is not friendly.  Dr Gilchrist is the worst and will not return calls ever!  Stay away from this practice .
1 Don't Go.  My mom went as we are newer to Arizona and haven't found a PCP. So she went. They aent her for test...etc...she went back to get her results...they would NOT see her!  WHY?  They had sent out a bill the day before...and it hadn't been paid yet...my mom hadn't received it...so can't pay a bill you haven't gotten...she had full plans on paying it the following Friday... her payday...nope wouldn't see her!  They never did give her the reaults. She went to a better DR and they got the results for her. (because inaurance covered that part 100%)  We had an appointment with them. We were early...ended up waiting over an hour before we finally said screw it and left..  Sitting in their small waiting room with 3 kids...  If you care about your health...go elsewhere.
1 Long wait times, very little time with the Doctor. Can't fill the same prescription that i've had for the last 10 yrs over the phone, you have to make an appointment to request a refill. This place is bad, avoid it if you value your time.
1 I liked my therapist, and I enjoyed the therapy process.  However, they screwed up my billing.  I have spoken with them over A DOZEN times and received (no exxageration) over 75 phone calls from their third party billing vendor since first going in November last year.  Their office is entirely clueless, and despite receiving payment from the insurance company (which I had to handle and arrange because of Physiotherapy Associates incompetence), I still receive two to three phone calls a week.    Do not go here.  There are a lot of great therapist whose offices will not treat you like garbage.
5 He is a no nonsense doctor. He asks the right questions and expects reasonable answers. What some people think of as poor bedside manner and communication I call getting to the point, let him fix it and go, so, he can take the next patient. He doesn't need to hear your life story unless it pertains to your medical issue. I used him 12 years ago when I lived here, I recently moved back to town and actually changed insurance plans so I could see him. There is never anyone in the waiting room, your are taken back to exam room within 5 minutes and he is there to see you in a few minutes too. If you are looking for someone to chit chat and waste time....he is not that guy. He is very professional and to the point. Try him out, you will be impressed.
5 I love this place. The staff are very friendly and make you feel welcome. I've been visiting this location for monthly massages since dec 2015 and every time the experience has been amazing. Highly skilled massage therapists, clean rooms and affordable prices. Feels like a spa. I highly recommend this place.
5 Tom and the gang at Above and Beyond are as good as it gets. Very professional and effective. Easy and comfortable to talk to. Highly recommend them if you should ever need any physical therapy needs. A+
2 I'm looking for a new general practitioner, so I call this place for an appointment. The receptionist asks what insurance I have. I tell her the name of the insurance company, and she goes, "Ugh. With that insurance, it will be at least two weeks."   Nice to know that they prioritize their patients based on insurance type. I guess that's all health care, though. At least they don't try to hide it here!   Needless to say, I didn't make an appointment.
4 My Dad was hospitalized at Kindred from May 22nd to June 9th. He was transferred from another hospital which wanted to send him to rehab and Kindred was the only other place in town that would accept him as he had a feeding tube in his nose. Admittedly, I was horrified after reading the reviews. I cried the first time I went to visit him. However, my Dad received exceptional care here. His improvements were swift and he was able to do physical therapy. Dr. Sinai and Dr. Lee took great care of him, as well as the PA Henry Lee. Dr. Sinai is down to earth, she's real, and she cares about her patients.  Yes the stay was not perfect-the case manager lost my dad's disability paperwork that she needed to have filled out multiple times, and their were nurses that could use some improvement. However, the majority of the nurses, CNAs, and respiratory therapists were great. January, Orlando, Jeremy, and Christy were awesome. One nurse named Winton never even had my Dad as a patient and still checked on him all the time! There are so many people that cared for him that it would be hard to name them all. I'm so incredibly grateful that my Dad is home, healthy, and still here. My family deeply appreciates and thanks the staff at Kindred hospital for caring for my father.
5 I'm so thankful I relied on Yelp to find Dr. Levins in 2012. For the few years, he's been there for me and helped me tremendously. His politeness and knowledge are an absolute blessing. Without question, he's one of the better doctors I've ever seen in my life. Thanks again!
5 I usually don't take my youngest sister in for her appointments, as I just moved down here after getting out of the military, but for some reason she wanted me there. I was a little nervous and felt a bit out of place...that is until I walked in the door; it was a totally friendly atmosphere and the munchkin seemed to know everyone.  We were called back right on time and Kimberly, my sister's speech therapist,  seemed very sincere and warm. I loved the way she spoke to the little one (I'm a bit overprotective) and how she was somehow able to keep her attention throughout the whole session. The woman never lost her patience, or looked as if she were anything other than happy to be there.   It's nice to know my family is being taken care of no matter where I am on the globe. The people there truly care for our children, or in my case, siblings.
5 I had a great chiropractor in Colorado and when I moved back here I didn't think I would find someone as good. I was wrong! The staff is so friendly and dr. Reiss is great! I'm feeling so much better with my neck and shoulders and over all. If your looking for someone who really cares check them out! I'm really glad I found them!
1 This place has caused me a lot of trouble. They opened newly and are extremely disorganized. Firstly, the walk-in reception staff is RUDE. But most importantly, this is what they did to me: I went into the clinic and was asked to take a test. Two weeks later I get a call saying all samples were contaminated and I have to take the test again. I did. Now, only after consistently following up with them for three weeks, they give me my test results. Five weeks lost here, when I am suffering a lot. And only because of inefficiency. There's no way the results would have taken over 5 business days based on the tests I took. Then I go to follow up on results and they tell me I need a specialist. Now I've been following up about getting the referral for three weeks, and they haven't yet responded.  So if you really need some attention, don't go here. If you have generic flu etc, then sure, go ahead. But be prepared to wait for a long time in the wait lines.
5 Knowledgeable and friendly staff. Showed me a alot of new techniques to counter chronic pain. I definitely recommend them.
5 I was hesitant at first just due to the 40 minute wait, but gee willies this guy is an amazing doctor!! He is VERY thorough, professional, and friendly. My girlfriend wants to see him now.
5 Forget luxury, when you need some serious knots worked on goto Jim. Very very knowledgeable, listens & best of all when he feels you've had enough he cuts you off & gives your muscles time to recover.
5 I had my left ACL replaced on 11JUN14. On 27JUN14 I was released to start my physical therapy.  Being a bit "handicapped" I wanted to take my physical therapy somewhere close. I had seen the Ignite building many times as it was pretty much across teh street from me so I decided to go there.  Funny story, I actually looked up physical therapists on my insurance list for who was on their list. I was in a rush and found Kinect Physical Therapy on the map (also just off Riggs), called, and made an appointment. I showed up at Ignite for my "appointment" to which they kindly said that I was not in the system. I figured that maybe something got missed... then as I was filling out the normal paperwork it dawned on me that I was at the wrong place. I confirmed with Ignite that I was covered under my insurance and then called Kinect to say that I wouldn't be with them. Ignite is the place that I wanted - they had good reviews on Yelp as well as being super close to me so I stuck with them.  Sorry Kinect!  I am now about 3 weeks into my treatment at Ignite. I have worked with or been worked on by Joe (Physical Therapist), Ashley (Technician), and Tara (Occupational Therapist). The short story on them is that they are great all around.  As for treatment they have a nice blend of hands-on therapy (i.e. massages), manual exercises for you to do yourself (i.e. heel slides, stationary bike), and technology (i.e. ultrasound, laser, electrical muscle stimulation). I have done other therapy for other ailments and the blend ratio was much different than here (i.e. all manual exercises, etc.). The multi-directional approach, at least to me, seems sound and I personally appreciate it. I feel that there are some things that are better served by manual exercises over technology and vice-versa. And let us face the facts, nobody wants to go in somewhere, pay money (insurance or not) just to be given manual exercises that they could probably look up online and do at home.  As an added bonus all the other patients there are friendly too. As you may have guessed you end up getting on similar schedules and start seeing the same people all the time... which is kind of cool. Since I am stuck at home with my leg I have been designated as the babysitter so I've had to take them into Ignite. All the workers there are kid-friendly so as long as your kids can be self-sustaining and respectful then Ignite wouldn't mind them be there. Just make sure that they don't decide to sit on their sandwich like my son did.  The place seems to make good use of their floor as well. They have multiple tables along the wall where 80% of the work seems to take place and then exercise equipment in the middle and then some free-weights and mats along the wall. See the pictures. Furthermore they also have two rooms with doors just in-case you want a massage (by their in-house massage therapist, Kyle) or you are a little shy about showing skin for any treatment that requires you to lift your shirt/pants (i.e. laser treatment), I haven't seen anyone use that but I do want to make it known that there is an option if that is something that concerns you.  A few little random things to wrap this review up. They do seem clean as well. Doing the exercises does get you a little sweaty on the tables and the tables are cleaned right there in front of you. Again, nice to see. They also have a TV to watch and if nothing is on/playing then they usually just have Pandora or something playing.  All-in-all, a great place. I am happy with them so far and I will update this review if anything changes.
5 This review is for Amber McDaniel, NP at the Chandler, AZ location. I have established with Amber for primary care. She is very thorough and knowledgeable.  I feel like my health and well being is definitely in good hands. It's great to be in an office where the providers and staff really care. I will recommend them to friends and family.
1 Very rude staff. And the doctor was impersonal. I'm very healthy so hardly had to see them but for being a patient of theirs for some time, I was never impressed with how I was treated when I did have to go in. I was too busy to look for another doctor until one of the girls crossed the line and that ended my services with them once and for all. I should've read the reviews before wasting my time but, live and learn.
4 Lucky me in finding this place at first it does look a little sketchy since the bathroom is also a giant shower.  My   masseuse was great but she did chew gum during my session she was alittle chatty too. She made a few comments about how tense I was but at the end of the hour I could feel the difference. Will be back again.
5 Thank you to Dr Gallegher for helping me with my neck and shoulder.  He's AMAZING!  I'm almost 100% because of him.  Highly recommended!!
5 I have had my share of injuries and surgeries. I've been to different places for therapy and hands down AthletiCare is the best!  Dr Morgan Crum and his staff takes great care of all patients and front office, Rose is great too!!! I don't go anywhere else... when I need to be put back together ... this is where I go!!!
1 I adore and respect my physician, Dr. Koppenbrink. The problem does not rest with him, as he recently joined this group.  When I leave the office, I always ask what my copay is. Both visits I was told there was none, as I have Medicare.  Then, the harassing robo calls begin, telling me I haven't paid my bill!  I have spoken to the office to no avail. The calls are more like I would think a collection agency would make, and it's frustrating, as there is no one with whom to speak. The phones are always busy if you wish to not talk at a machine.  The staff  is curt when I'm in office, except for my doctor's own assistant. This practice may cause me to seek a new doctor, which is very sad. The partners in this practice need to meet to discuss and resolve these issues, all of which are office staff related, as well as how they have decided to handle billing.
5 My wife's back went out setting down our 6 month old one day and the detail and care she received from this team was so outstanding that I decided to get all checked out since I have struggled with lower back pain for years. I'm impressed to say that after following through with the plan they set up specifically for me I am pain free, have better posture, know how to properly workout, pick up and carry kids, and no longer feel like the weight of the world is on my lower back. I feel brand new and I'm very shocked that this was possible with no meds and no surgery. This team is OUTSTANDING!
5 I just moved here with my family from New Jersey and my kids needed a pediatric doctor. I decided to give this place a shot & thank goodness I did! From the moment I walked in I was in awe, Adelante is a beautiful facility! The front office girls are sweet, the medical assistants are extremely knowledgeable and they took their time to ask myself and my kids questions. Dr. Singleton is great with kids, its like he is a child whisperer. My kids were at ease and were never scared. He makes seeing the doctor fun and exciting. The world need more doctors like him. You can tell that all the workers are like a family. Hands down the best pediatrician my kids have seen. I highly recommend for all you out there to make an appointment. They also have family practice and internal medicine will be added shortly.
1 Had an appointment yesterday and it was nasty from check in to check out! Check in lady was nasty, rude, short and mean! The nurse chuckled at the reason of the visit (depression), doctor was soooo rough and short and not willing to treat, and the guy at the check out was so unhappy and angry with life, rude! I have never been to a facility where patients are treated like this. DO NOT GO HERE! although the building was very new, nice and clean.
1 I base my rating on the fact that it's impossible to get anyone on the phone or to return my phone calls. I sent a tour request online and heard nothing. Then, a couple days later I called twice and left a voicemail and nothing. So disappointing. They looked so promising.
2 I chose to give this clinic a try under the recommendation of a friend. I was under the understanding that going to a D.O. would be a good idea since I had heard that D.O.'s are more inclined to use holistic treatments than regular M.D.'s.  I found most of the support staff to be very pleasant with the only exception beinf one older, loud, very pushy nurse. The doctors and P.A.'s seem pleasant for the most part but they are very, very focused on testing. It is nothing to rack up a thousand dollars just for oneida their physicals. And they were ALWAYS pushing for me to get physicals. Now I understand that some find it useful to have annual data points to track their health. I am not one of those people. I went to see the doctor because I had pneumonia. After 2 round of treatment and several weeks I was no better off. I finally found a treatment that worked for me through more homeopathic means. Every time I went for treatment they would try to schedule a physical exam even though I was sick. I had to repeatedly decline because I thought could get a better overall idea of my overall health of my physical were done when I was not sick. Eventually after I was healthy I did get the very expensive physical done and the doctor was surprised that almost all of my results showing me to be more like I was in my 20's rather than my mid 40's. Nice I thought.  About nine months later I went in for Pink Eye. And again as I was leaving I was told that I need to schedule a physical. No thanks I said. I know I'm ok. Them a couple months later I started getting calls to schedule a physical.  The clinic has supplements it sells and it feels like to me that is their real focus. I could be wrong but that is my feeling.
5 Rose was amazing! I am now a patient of hers and see her weekly. I moved to the AZ area as I am a distance runner and needed better weather and more available training days. I looked up Rose as I needed work done on my ankles and lower back and I have to say, I am back running harder and stronger than I was before I moved here. My prior running injuries are no longer with me and I am now being adjusted and see Rose once a week. She is a someone who knows athletes and knows the human body. Cannot be more impressed and pleased with her services.
4 I've had massage, chiropractic and physio from here.  Physio - Daniel: Daniel is great. he really knows what he's doing and has this way of testing pressure points and giving you results within the first session. He also does aggressive manual stimulation that hurts, but gives pretty immediate results after. I'm finally able to lift weights again! Very different from the other physio place I tried where the treatment was lame and standard and aimed at old people. This is person/injury specific. Exercises were like nothing I've seen online, tailor made and I had great improvement over about 8 sessions. I highly recommend him.  Chiro: Kevin: Again, different from typical chiro and very similar to physio in the kind of manual manipulation used. He was funny and was honest and told me I didn't need to come back again.  Massage: Oh... Maria. How do you solve a problem like Maria leaving?  She was a really great masseur.  The atmosphere here isn't great for massages though, as there is a lot of loud talking, machine sounds, and the therapists don't play music unless you ask. Too bad she went to Australia! I tried her colleague Rachael and DID NOT like her services. It wasn't a massage. She kept asking me to move all the time - bend and stretch - and ended it off by squeezing my temples and giving me a headache. I specifically asked for relaxation and kept telling her I was uncomfortable, but she just said "sorry, I know." and didn't change anything. That coupled with the poor atmosphere, I wouldn't go to her for a relaxation massage. Better off going to physio if you want to be bent/ stretched and manipulated. But some people who want aggressive sports massage therapy may enjoy that. Kinda reminds me of a Thai massage?  Anyway, generally a great place to go for treatment if you are athletic or young and looking to get back to sports and not just "daily life."
1 I've been a patient of WFP for 2 years. My first few visits with a nurse practitioner who, thankfully  is not longer there as this office won't allow you to see a different provider once you're established with someone. In February of 2017 I saw Dr. Turner who was WONDERFUL, so if you are going to be a patient here, make sure this is who you see! And lastly, I saw WFP "Allergy Specialist" 2 days ago, which was by far my worst experience at this clinic.  I called WFP to see if they had an ENT in house or if they could point me in the direction of reputable office as I have been dealing with vertigo for 2 months. I've had an MRI, been on a steroid, had the Epley Maneuver done multiple times, been getting massages focusing on my neck and scm and still the problem persists, so the next step was to an ENT as my MRI revealed blockage in my left maxillary sinuses. WFP could not provide me with info for an ENT but said their "allergy specialist" works with vertigo and recommended I see him and if he couldn't help then he could refer me out to an ENT. His first available was a week away but I booked it and was excited that I could finally be getting some relief.  The check in/vitals and all of that went smoothly but when Dr. Willim came in is where everything went wrong.   For starters, I had my fiancé with me who was sitting in the extra chair and I was on the exam table (which you have to walk by to get to the extra chair where my fiancé was sitting) and Dr. Willim walked right past me and introduced himself to my fiancé first before even greeting me. Annoying, considering I'm the patient, but small potatoes considering what followed. He sat down and opened his laptop and asked me why I was there. I told him and before even letting me explain what courses of treatment I had already taken or doing any kind of exam on me, he told me I had SCM Disorder. He then told a story of his brother coming from Michigan (with different symptoms-no vertigo) to see a massage therapist "Jim" who he recommended and then he read me an article from his laptop about how having a tight scm can cause vertigo. I told him I've been seeing a massage therapist for this along with all of the other treatment I've done and only then did he start his exam. He told me my sinuses were very inflamed, especially considering it's not allergy season and asked if I had allergies, then said he couldn't say if my allergies had a link to my vertigo. I had given a copy of my MRI to the nurse and it was sitting right next to him the entire time but he didn't bother to look at it until I reminded him it was there and he still insisted that the findings of that along with my swollen sinuses can't for sure be linked to my vertigo. He then told me I have a nasally voice and recommended I take turmeric, which he mispronounced, but immediately went back into referring me to his massage therapist. What's more shocking is that while referring me over and over to this guy, he told me that WFP doesn't like him referring out to this office, that the office he was referring me to was dysfunctional and I'd wait on hold at least 30 mins to book my appointment and that I'd have to motivate Jim to give me a good massage.. seriously, this was his BEST course of treatment he could come up with for me. Oh and he also brought in a big blue ball with grooves on it and told me to buy one of those from some place online and told me I could barrel roll across my floor at home to help move any crystals that may be in my inner ear fluid. I couldn't wait to get out of his office.   This appointment was a giant waste of time! How WFP can call Dr. Willim and allergy specialist when I have an MRI stating blockage in my sinuses and in his exam he found sinus inflammation paired with what he called a "nasally voice" but he recommends massage, turmeric and laying on a blue ball... I will never be going back to WFP.
5 On the recommendation of my hubby who previously came from here, I decided to go due to my many headaches-apparetly people aren't supposed to get them as often as I do. It is located in a very nice, new business park on Tropicana, it has ample parking, and  I couldn't tell you about lighting; they are only open in the day time. Nice waiting room; there was coffee, tea, and fresh chocolate chip cookies.  It was my first time ever to a chiropractor, and for 32 I think that's kind of old for having never gone. So I guess overall I was very pleased because Dr. Reiss brought new insight as to why I may be having headaches that I never thought of before.  I thought the "speedometer" was cool , that rolls up your back and shows where the tension is. After I left, my headache was gone within a few hours! I foresee future visits :)
5 Dr. Robertson and his staff are great!   I did physical therapy for my knee and back problems.    I was in a lot of pain and they helped me so much.   Mike is excellent.   He is awesome at setting up exercises that make you feel better and stretching out your muscles.    The message therapist is awesome also.    The best part of their office is that they will answer any and every question.   Even in their busiest times they have a great environment and really seem to enjoy what they do!
5 I've been going here for over 2 months. The Staff and Doctors are very nice and professional. The wait is always prompt, which I'm not used to with past Doctors offices. I recommend this place.
5 This review is waaaay overdue. I was referred here by my Yuma chiropractor when I moved to Phoenix.  Simply put, they are awesome! The environment is positive, fun, and upbeat. Everyone is friendly, they know you by name, and make you feel comfortable.   I came in with some issues with my shoulder, neck, and lower back. Initially, I could barely lift my arm. Now, I can lift it with little effort. My neck was curved in the opposite direction. Now, it's starting to have a normal curvature. Additionally, my lower back has shown improvement as well.   I've been amazed at the progress I've made in such a short amount of time. I'm so glad I decided to try a more holistic approach to fixing my shoulder versus opting for something invasive such as surgery.  I pass over five chiropractors to get to their office. I feel that speaks volumes for the awesome work they do!
5 I had a great visit here. I didn't wait long to get helped. Everyone was really nice and helpful. My doctor took his time listening to me explain my symptoms. They drew blood and I had explained I usually get nervous so they were careful and I had no problems when they drew blood. I will definitely be coming here again.
1 While the psychiatrists and counselors there are good, their billing office is awful. I pay my bill every time when I go there, and every time they send me a bill saying that I owe more. I explain that I self paid, because my insurance doesn't cover it at all and I would get no benefit from going through them. They then correct the bill to be the self pay amount and I go on my merry way. This is way more work than it is worth, and there has to be a better option out there.
5 Dr. Lederman has been my physician for 2 shoulder replacements over the past 8 years. His work is excellent. I have been able to return to my normal lifestyle without the discomfort. Quality of life has improved dramatically. Dr. Lederman is a straight shooter. He tells it like it is in an empathetic manner. The process followed for before, day of surgery, and aftercare is very thorough. I would recommend him to anyone requiring extensive shoulder care.
2 My daughter went here for a regular exam and check up. They took her card information for payment. They ran the card 3 times, but took the one payment. This incurred $6 worth of fees for the multiple attempts. They then took the money and continue to bill her. We have faxed over the proof of all the attempts and the actual debit. They still continue to bill! Pathetic! They need to get it together.  Why they had to swipe it 3 times when they had their money I have no idea!
5 Dr. Sharma is amazing! He spends time with his patients and is very mindful of your finances and insurance even if they do not accept it. The cash patient fee is very reasonable. There was no wait, I was in and out in about 45 minutes without feeling rushed. I would come back here anytime! Love this guy already and it's just my first visit.
5 Nice and welcoming front desk assistants. I love the nextgen patient portal.  Quick convenient and simple
5 I feel very confident in using HealthSource to heal from my auto accident, my sports-related injuries, as well as life's wear and tear. The entire staff is very kind and accommodating from the moment you step in the door. The therapists and assistants customize a plan to keep you moving forward in the healing process. They help you get back to every day life by reducing pain and gaining strength. HealthSource is a positive environment, with friendly, top-of-the-line professionals.
5 I am new to Phoenix so I did a quick Google search for doctors in my area.  Thank you Google, you totally hooked it up.  I have only been there twice now but I feel like I've been going there forever.  Everyone is so lovely and thorough.  I've been to several doctors over the last several years because of insurance or lack there of but I'm very excited to have found a practice with a doctor who tells me what I need to hear with compassion not judgement.  And he's funny!
5 Before joining this gym I was very indecisive but I remembered how nice the gold gym was at this location and after my friend raved about the gym I finally went for it. Paris who sold me my membership was so patient and kept me informed on every membership option, specials and didn't rush me when being indecisive. I liked that their service is to go the extra step to make their guest feel wanted at this gym. Paris made sure to check up on me a few times after I've began working out at EOS to get my feedback on my experience as well as make sure I'm enjoying my membership. I love this gym although I can't always travel to this location since it's too far from me I still enjoy the aliante and lake mead location. I also love that with my membership I am able to bring someone with me every time I go that deal with the membership is better than any of gym memberships I've had previously. Couldn't be more satisfied with this gym and their customer service!
5 My father was severely injured due to an accident that occurred at work. My family and I tried different therapy groups before we found this clinic. It didn't take long for us to decided that Performance Physical Therapy is the perfect place for him to receive all his treatments.   Pro(s):  -Friendly and Welcoming receptionists. Our favorite is Juliet! She has a very positive attitude and engages in conversation. She asks about our day and seems genuinely interested in what we have to say. :) -Danny and Joel are awesome PTs! They really know what they're doing and do not force/push patients to hard.  Con(s): N/A  Overall, I'd recommend this place to anyone. 10/10 would too! :P
1 Here we go again!!  What a joke this place is. First off the office staff at front counter NEED TO GO TO CUSTOMER SERVICE SCHOOL!!  Don't try to call, they just put you on hold. Oh, and if you go down there, they just ignore you, or take somebody else that walks up to the counter. I guess I was "just a mirage".  It's funny, they are always on the phone and when they get off, eyes go right to stupid computer. WTF??!!  I guess you have to be an ass and say: are you gonna help me or are you gonna go to your little computer world and do nothing. I was there this morning, walked up to counter, like usual one on phone, one on computer, and one was MIA. Computer jerk didn't even look up, probably to busy with stupid book, ( aka: facebook) or online romance with screen. I bet it wasnt job related!! Other had a phone growing out of his ear just like every time I go in there then hangs up goes right to computer. TYPICAL.  Never surprises me anymore. So, I said fu** this place and walked out. Thanks to everybody at Freemont medical on lake-mead and Van Wagenen for you ignoring, crappy customer service, no pay attention to people that walk up to counter, put people  on hold all the time awesome customer service!!  HA HA......YEA RIGHT!!    What a joke this place is.
4 dr evenson was a good dr but just not my cup of tea I need personality...dr.coy was amazing he told me im crazy and now im at peace..lol jk but really I like this practice and the girls in the front aren't as rude as everyone makes them out to be im happy to be a patient!
1 Less than impressed on my first visit. Going on 45 min after my appointment time despite asking me to be 30 minutes early. Took 1 minute to call me to the desk to take my Co pay. Now I understand why. If u have nothing to do all day then I guess this is the office for you.
5 Had hand surgery by Dr. Adamany and his PA Brad. Great job, great same day surgery center with pre op nurse Jared and discharge nurse Kathleen. Think I got those names right as I was a bit drugged up. Huge thank you for helping me with my traffic finger!
5 Finding a new dentist is one of the hardest things for me to do when moving to a new area.  I am beyond blessed that I gave Verve Dental and Dr. Brueske a try.  From the moment I walked in the door I was impressed.  The space is very welcoming and the staff at the front desk were friendly and personable.  While I waited (which was only for a couple minutes) I was able to make myself a fancy coffee drink from their machine, so yummy.  Dr. Brueske and his hygienist Belle made me feel so relaxed and comfortable and calmed my nerves.  I have had issues with my gums in the past which makes me hesitant to trust anyone but they really got me back in shape and I never felt like I was being sold something I didn't need.  I highly recommend both Dr. Brueske and Belle to anyone.  Belle was very patient and gentle with my cleaning and Dr. Brueske was very professional, had a great bed side manor and I look forward to going back again, I never thought I would say that about a dentist.  Thank you!
1 I am very unhappy with this facility! It is the most disorganized MD office I have ever been in. Both staff and medical personnel are short with you and seem very much under pressure - resulting in chaos and poor treatment. If you have a question, it may literally take days to get a reply  I was handed crutches and a boot (partially torn Achilles) with NO instructions for use! When the boot began malfunctioning (wouldn't hold air) I was told that a replacement would cost me over $200 if insurance didn't cover a 2nd boot - right in the middle of my therapy!!! The manufacturer wound up telling me that all I had to do was take it  back & get a replacement & they would fully refund the Doctor! Way to look out for your patient!  They also charged me $30 just to sign off on a handicapped placard which I am (unfortunately) qualified for.  I called to complain about the boot & had to leave a message and sure enough, 2 days later, I'm still waiting for a reply! Perfectly typical with that outfit & I'll go elsewhere
5 Dr. Hermansen & Dr. Hortin are the best! Their staff is amazing too! Very helpful & kind. They definitely know what they're doing there & how to treat patients. 5 stars, only wish I could've kept going forever.
4 I am a self proclaimed massage connoisseur (seriously I've gotten about 100 in my life time). I'm very particular and know exactly what my body needs..This is the BEST place to get a massage in Charlotte. They listen to you, focus on your problem areas and always check in to make sure you are satisfied with the pressure. If you need them to spend time on a certain area, they will gladly accommodate.  Also they offer their services for a fairly reasonable price which is one of the main things I take into consideration. The booking process is easy and the representatives at the front desk are always friendly
5 My husband and I both went to Dr. Joe for the first time a few months ago. He took time to talk with both of us, checked out our concerns and made necessary referrals. Great guy - friendly and very open. Would highly recommend him and his staff was very helpful.
5 Amazing staff. They truly care. Cool atmosphere very knowledgeable had super bad knee pain it's gone now
5 Down to earth and knowledgable. the finest doctor I have been to in decades.  If he doesn't have the answer he refers you to another physician.  He is everything doctors used to be and more. I see several specialists for different ailments yet it is his opinions that matter to me the most.
5 I saw Dr. Dana  Hemmati for a GI consult 2 weeks ago. Her staff was very efficient and helpful. I had no measurable wait. One week later I had my colonoscopy and had a very positive experience with Dr. Hemmati. The office has already been in contact with me regarding the biopsies taken. I recommend her to any patients who need GI help. You will be very pleased with the care you receive. Paul M.
5 I have seen the majority of the doctors at MVFP and I love them all. They get me in quickly and treat me with great respect. They are easy to get a hold of and contact me back with my test results. I love the front office staff and all their MA's. They have a great practice and I have seen them on and off for years.
5 I work in the healthcare field and know a lot of primary care physicians in Las Vegas and Dr. Kinel has everyone beat by a landslide.   From his front desk staff (Agnes or Machena) who are angels! You are never going to deal with someone who is unprofessional or rude and his staff has been the same since I have known him 4+ years! No high turnover rate here!   Scheduling is usually pretty on point too! If you make an appt at 9:30 you won't be waiting until 11:30 like most docs around town. The longest wait I've had was 15 min which is more than acceptable.   Now onto Dr. Kinel... This man is such an outlier in the healthcare field nowadays- in a great way!   He doesn't overbook, you will never find the waiting room full of people who all have the same appt time as you.   You will never feel rushed, he will make sure all your questions are answered and that you understand the treatment etc   Also, he is not in this for the money, I know health insurances force their hand & doctors have to bill for every little thing to break even but I've seen him take the high moral road multiple times rather then collecting that extra sick copay etc.   I cannot reccommend Dr. Kinel enough! I used to insist on going to a woman doctor but after seeing the level of healthcare he was giving other patients and my husband I couldn't not go to him!
1 Well I came in here for abdominal problems and they took my insurance without any problems. i payed my $15 copay and everything else was to be paid for. To be safe they wanted to check my blood. Better to be safe than sorry I guess  The nurse I had was amazing. She is great at taking blood, I didn't feel a thing. Sorry, I cant remember her name or else I would recommend her for blood tests. The PA was okay. Nothing bad to say about him.   Everything was great and the doctors visit went pleasant...until 3 weeks later. I got a bill saying I needed to pay $209.00 for blood tests that they insisted on!! This is bull sh*t! I have NEVER had to pay for blood work. Don't go here if you don't want bills weeks later!!    They would have 5 stars just for the sweet nurse alone. But when there are extra charges that a college student can't afford?? No way. I wouldn't even give one star.
5 Dr Eric and Dr Rob are top notch! Mesa chiropractic has everything you could ever need for chiropractic care. They use cutting edge chiropractic biophysics and have tailored stretches and exercises for you to do in house, as well as massage therapy to top it all off. If you live in the valley, these are the chiropractors for you!
3 If i could give her 5 stars for her personality and willingness to help me with my weird cough i have had over the past almost 3 months now...I WOULD. Since this is based on an OVERALL experience you are probably wondering where this could have went wrong somehow right?        First off let me tell you that i am a certified medical assistant and caregiver that has grown up with educated human beings and family within the medical field as well So i know a lot about a lot of little things.  For example, Doctors make extra money off of the drugs that they prescribe like commission kind of.  If they prescribe stuff over the counter they wont be getting as much money in their pockets. Now i am sure she didn't mean this with the wrong intentions and did want to help me, but when i told other people within the medical field that are close friends and family they were just dumbfounded with her reasoning for my coughing. Acid reflux, sinus drip, or asthma? Really????? She prescribed two things i was not expecting at all given the fact that cheratussin did not help as much either or any OTC cough syrup.  The prednisone did not help me as much as she probably would have liked and only helped with my nasal congestion which has not been an issue what so ever to be quite honest. She also recommended prilosec which is for heart burns which i still have yet to try.  So based on the fact that she recommended an OTC drug shocked my friends mom who is a RN for merck.  My rib cage has been hurting since december from all my coughing i would have thought she would prescribe a stronger cough syrup to help the coughing and what she recommended besides the prilosec has not done much at all for my cough which they said would. If i could request my money back for my visit and money for the prescribed medicine i would since i am not strapped with cash.
5 Outstanding health care provider, and I can't say enough good things about Dr. Neil Sheth and the kind, caring staff.  Available for emergencies, quick response on critical issues, professional, courteous.  Dr. Sheth takes the time to explain all medical and treatment options, and listens to his patients and their families.  Extremely happy with this great place!
4 I really want to give Dr. Levins five stars, because he's a superb doctor.   Without digging too far into my medical history, I've seen Dr. Levins for a number of conditions, including a handful of serious allergies that I hadn't suffered from until moving to Arizona. He's prescribed medication when needed and follows up with regular appointments to ensure that I am a healthy patient.  As my PCP, Dr. Levins has referred me to a number of specialists for my various injuries, illnesses, and other unnamed maladies, including: an allergist, a urologist, two physical therapists, a dermatologist, a radiologist and a medical clinic.  With regard to his bedside manner, Dr. Levins is second to none. Although he sees hundreds of patients per week, I always feel that he personally cares about my health.  I'm giving Dr. Levins a less-than-perfect rating solely because the reception in his office is mildly abominable, and unfortunately, that is not an exaggeration. I won't go on a tirade about how people in professional settings should put on their big boy and big girl pants and fake a smile in client-facing roles...  However, one receptionist in particular always seems to have a problem with the world and greets every patient with barely bridled contempt. It's really off-putting, and if I didn't like Dr. Levins so much I'd tell this lady to shove it out her ear.
1 Visited six weeks ago with a sprained wrist to get an X-ray on the weekend. Front desk staff person intook my insurance information and told us (definitively) that they take our insurance and that our out of pocket would be 10%.  In fact they are "out of network" for our insurance (Cigna) and nothing was covered.  She should have known this being that she intakes insurance cards all day long and that they are always out of network for Cigna patients.   Had she not misspoken we would have gone to a different urgent care (Cigna apparently has their own urgent care facilities) that was in network.   I just received a bill for $450, for a wrist sprain, all because this company's representative at the front desk gave us false information about our insurance coverage at their facility.  I urge you to seek honest healthcare elsewhere that has the patient's best interest in mind, not the company's bottom line $.  This is an example of our broken healthcare system. It's companies like this that are more concerned with money grabbing than helping people.  (I will also add that the nurse that helped us had a bad attitude about working there).  We will be reporting this to the better business bureau and Arizona health board.  And will never go there again.
1 Absolute worst doctors experience ever. I would NEVER return and have instructed my insurance vender to NOT pay them.  I haven't been to a doctors in years, woke up with very bad hip/leg pain. Struggled through a few days and finally saw Dr. Zolton at the Highland location.  Get brought into the exam room, and asked to change into the paper underwear. Doctor Zolton opens the door and walks in. Leaves the door wide open for every one in the hall, patients across the hall to look in, VERY embarrassing.   He was very short with me. Got mad when I tried to explain the pain. Had an attitude from the start. Got mad again when I didn't answer in his medical terms. I snapped back at him and he seemed to get better.  They make you walk hallway across the building in paper underwear to the X-ray room, in bare feet so that was real nice.  Dr comes back in and pretty much does say anything but says he wants a MRI, then leaves. No time for questions I guess.  His assistant comes in. I tried to ask her questions and she gets an attitude again. I say I just want to leave and dress quickly and walk out.  I would NEVER recommend this place. It's a dump, dirty, and rude doctors and nurses. Must be all about the money here.  I left one star, because there isn't an option for no stars.
1 I'm sure the quality of care at the Mayo Clinic is great, except that I can't experience it because I can't get an appointment. I'm a new patient,  and last September I called for my initial exam.  It was scheduled about 10 weeks out.  A month later, I had to move it as I was going to be working out of the country.  No worries.  Rescheduled 9 weeks further out. Later, in mid-January, their office called: the doctor would be out; nothing available in the scheduling window; they will call me. In February, I get a packet in the mail and the appointment has been pushed out another 10 weeks, to the end of April.   Today, a Friday, with still another month to go before my first appointment, and fully six months after my initial call to them, I have a pinched nerve or muscle spasm. Never had this before. It's not terrible, but maybe a 4-5 on the 10 point pain scale: low-grade, dull, throbbing, persistent - don't lift the right arm or it gets moderately worse.  I call to see if I might get in so I don't have to live with the pain through the weekend.  I just need to see a nurse practitioner, not the (heaven forbid) doctor, to make sure it is nothing more serious.  Nope, sorry.    Quality of care also depends on availability.  Failure.
5 The staff here was so professional and they quickly and efficiently got my husband mobile and out of pain after his hip injury. Thank you!
4 What can I say about St Michaels? This is by far the best ER hospital in the city. Their quick response time is amazing when unfortunately my husband and I got rear ended by a moronic taxi driver. Luckily we were ok just a bit in shock. And also at the time I slid off from the motorcycle during a trial test. I was not injured but I had a very sore body the next day. The doctors here are very attentive.  I also love St Michaels Women Clinic when I had to go for the semi annual colposcopy follow-up; the clinic had a modern design to feel to it and state of the art medical equipment felt like you were in a dental clinic!
5 I am so thankful I do not wake up every morning with aches or knots in my neck and shoulders.   I started seeing Dr. Karen Ngo in March when my chronic pain in my neck, shoulders, mid and lower back were bothering me everyday. Let me tell you I have a pretty high tolerance to pain even without pain relief. I had a pretty bad whiplash from a motor vehicle accident about 7 years ago. By not seeing a chiropractor for the past 5 years, I do go for massages once in awhile. I am one of those people who do not find massages relaxing whatsoever but rather uncomfortable at times because of the pain. Massages do help me therapeutically.   I did not expect Dr. Ngo to help me rehabilitate as quickly as she has over this past 3 months. Her health teaching is very reassuring and helps me understand my body more. I never knew a chiropractor could help with the knots in our muscles! After every appointment I felt more accomplished and my body feeling stronger yet lighter. Essentially that heavy feeling I felt in my neck and shoulder were lifted. As well as the pain in my back were less. I will be seeing Dr. Ngo again for future follow ups and maintenance!   I highly recommend to friends and family to see her for consultation and treatment.
5 Dr. Reddy became my wife's primary care physician about 3 years ago.  I was impressed with his knowledge and compassion so I switched over to him also.  Over the past year both my wife and I both had new medical issues arise, and Dr. Reddy was quick to diagnose both of our conditions and refer us to the appropriate specialist.  I've referred several close friends to him over the years and everyone has been very pleased with him.  He really does care about his patients, and he takes the time to listen you and talk to you, not at you.  I can't say enough good things about Dr. Reddy.  If you're looking for an excellent doctor in Las Vegas that really cares about his patients, don't hesitate to go to him.  I'm not a personal friend of his, or someone in his office, trying to give him a good review to drum up business.  I felt compelled to right a review of my experience with him tonight after a friend of mine called to find out his name because he is looking a good family doctor for him and his wife.
2 Dr. Wolf has a good bedside manner, but is pretty much a pill pusher. I would go elsewhere for a primary care provider.
5 My 15-year-old daughter is very involved with soccer. While we were on vacation in Texas, she was doing some training and rolled her ankle resulting in a moderate ankle sprain.  As soon as we returned to AZ, we took her to Carling Physical Therapy for their evaluation and recommendations to strengthen her ankle. We were pleasantly surprised when she began some physical therapy treatments and laser treatments that very day. The sooner, the better, as far as we were concerned.  My daughter's recovery was quite remarkable! We were all amazed that in the span on one week-just three physical therapy sessions later- she was so much better. We continued therapy for another 3 weeks to continue to strengthen and stabilize her ankle to prevent re-injury. After those 3 weeks, she was released with their urging to return if her ankle worsened at all. She has been playing soccer back at an intense level for several weeks now and I am fully confident that she is 100% completely recovered.   We are so grateful to Carling Physical Therapy, and their staff of exceptional therapists, who gave my daughter outstanding care and personal attention.   If you need physical therapy, look no further. This is the place for you! They will take excellent care of you :)  With much thanks and appreciation, Allison Engle
1 This health care centre is poorly run.  The doctors care more about getting patients out of their office.  The doctor I saw didn't even introduce herself to me, I don't know her name and the appointment lasted two minutes (literally!).   I waited over an hour in the waiting room even though it was seemingly empty.   Find another walk-in clinic.
4 I was at my sports doc today and told them about this facility, I went for a massage and got a!!!!! great!!!!!! massage. I wasn't looking for a rub down , I needed a massage., I used to be a LMT and Im pretty snobbish to technique. ( Michelle) gave me my massage ( I think it was Michelle, I had her card out today, to give someone her info to go get a massage, and that's what reminded me that I wanted to comment here, but sadly I may have lost it :( I know she has all boys....and one girl ;0)) no kidding its been over a week and I still feel grateful for her service . I was attended to as soon as I walked in, after showed me around a bit, and when im in need I feel this will be my ' go to' place
1 I used to be a pt of Doctor o'clair and she was the best doctor I've ever had. Once she left, I should have too. I won't mention the other doctors I saw because I never had a negative experience with them. Great doctors. I moved to Florida last May and called them in September to have my medical records faxed over. Then they decide to charge me the annual patient fee!? I'm not even a patient anymore and I am being charge for a fax? Very upset that the practice charges a ridiculous fee.
3 Great therapist and convenient hours! Less crowded and great Summerlin location!   This clinic is a bit smaller but clean and not so hectic and busy as the Jones location.  Staff is wonderful and accommodating. They are open on Sat and Sun too!   Very happy with the therapists here. But be prepared to show a doctors note if you call in sick or you'll be charged $10! Policy sucks!  Located in a strip mall next to Golds Gym.
2 Although they were busy I was not happy sitting waiting in the doctors office for 53 minutes. No one came in to let me know they are running behind. They have been my doctors office for 3 years. My old doctor is retiring so now I need to find a new doctor. Completely unsatisfied at the results of the waiting time and time on hold to be able to speak with a human to schedule! I has happy they got me in the same day with a different doctor because I blew out my knee which is why I am giving 2 stars instead of one!
4 I don't recommend seeing the nurse practitioner, Sandy Sargent bc she was a complete B!! She had a major attitude problem. I did see dr. Strauss and he's excellent. Very nice and professional.
2 unfortunately I have had bad experience 3 out of 4 times that I have visited the clinic.  The front office is very friendly and helpful but don't believe everything they say.  After you get a bill that you were not supposed to or if you get a bill for the wrong amount, good luck finding someone there to take care of it for you! I have been waiting 1 hour and 17 minutes in the room for the Dr. to come I am not sure if they forgot about me!  when I got their attention they apologized and said that they have been extra busy that day and if I wanted they could reschedule me!!! Seriously? after almost 1.5 hour of waiting? Couldn't they let me know sooner?  Anyways, I do not recommend this facility at all and if you have an option I would encourage you to go to a different clinic.  Good luck and wish you lots of health
1 Despite the fact that the staff and doctors are friendly and personable, the scheduling system is horrid.  Whether you have an scheduled appointment or not, the wait time is well over 2.5 hours!!!  If I didn't have to go there due to a work related injury, I wouldn't.
5 I called TOCA after reading up on their physicians online. It was hassle free to get an appointment within a very reasonable timeframe, which is not what I expected at all with a specialist. I scheduled with Dr. Harmsen and was pleasantly surprised at my first appointment how prompt everything was.   Dr. Harmsen is second to none. I began seeing him for shoulder issues. He always took the time to listen to my entire history and all of my concerns. After a lot of discussion where Dr. Harmsen provided me with all of the options and potential positives and negatives, we determined that surgery was the best route for me. He always takes the time to explain every test, every result and all next steps in a way that I can understand. I never feel like I am just a number to him, that I am taking too much of his time, or that I should have any uncertainty about outcomes. Dr. Harmsen provided me with all of the relevant information and made me feel in control, but with his expertise as guidance.   On surgery day, Dr. stopped in to talk with me and made me feel at ease. He showed me the implants he would use, explained the procedure and there were no unanswered questions. After surgery, he made sure that I was doing well while still in the hospital and made sure that I knew he was available  if needed. Follow ups have been successful so far and it seems like I will be able to achieve the goals that we set in the beginning.   The main takeaway is this. If you want sugar coating, beating around the bush, or a doctor that isn't going to give it to you straight, Dr. Harmsen is not for you. However, if you want an expert surgeon with wonderful credentials, great bedside manner and the time to devote to you, I highly recommend Dr. Harmsen. He is a great asset to TOCA. And a bonus - his MA, Shannon, is AMAZING.
5 I have been procrastinating on doing this review, but now it's time I finally get this done!  I was with my previous doctor for roughly 8 years and even though I hadn't been satisfied with him for the past few years, I did not want to go through the hassle of switching doctors. In the beginning he was okay, but over the past few years I would wait any where from 60-90 minutes just to see this guy and he couldn't get out of the room fast enough! Literally 3-5 minutes in and he had a hand on the door knob trying to walk out as I still talking to him and had questions to ask. After my last visit I said "enough is enough" and decided to finally make the switch!  I should have done this years ago!  I did some research and found Dr Lee online through some review sites, but basically decided just to roll the dice since he was accepting new patients. Dr Lee is outstanding! This guy has sat down with me for upwards of 30 minutes at a time, answering questions and explaining things to me in great detail! He is the polar opposite of my previous doctor and I appreciate that so much!  I had 2 separate issues that my previous doctor had just chalked up to "getting older". What horseshit!  Dr Lee treated the problems and resolved everything in a matter of a couple of weeks! Because of him I am back in the gym 5-6 days a week, which I hadn't been able to do for the better part of a year! He seems to take a genuine interest in his patients health and well being!  I really should have done this years ago.  The girls at the reception desk are always very nice and friendly and efficient. Plus the staff at the lab next door have always been pleasant to deal with as well.  I am so happy to have found a medical professional that I can feel confident in with their work and assessment(s) and medical opinions.   Thank You Dr Lee!  5 stars.  As good as it gets!
5 Been coming here for a little over a month now and I love it here. The people are super nice and cater to your pain in the up most professional way. Will defiantly make this a place to visit often when needed.
4 Sister float. The owners were extremely nice and explained everything for our 1st time floating. We liked that everything was clean and felt well taken care of. The tank is spacious, no claustrophobia going on here. Enjoyed the variety of light colors and eventually turned all lights and sounds off. The floating neck pillow was the perfect addition. The o lay down side to this float was the water got cold and we ended our float early. Had the water been warmer, it would've been perfect.
4 There are a few nurses and doctors in the emergency room that are great went in for second degree burns all over my hand and they handled it better then I thought they could forget his name but any Asian doc your in luck or pa Ashley other then that they are kind of rude shandra a nurse is an amazing woman
5 I was experiencing back, neck and shoulder pain that slowed down my day, limited my activities and overall, I just did not feel well. Dr. Chow provided treatment to immediately help relieve some of the discomfort I was having. He took the time to understand my habits and lifestyle with long work hours and a lot of commuting then proceeded to provide recommendations to help improve my posture, strengthen key muscles to significantly reduce and eliminate a lot of the discomfort I was experiencing. With Dr. Chow's treatments and advice, I feel much better, thank you!
4 I've been looking for an RMT I can go to on the regular here in Toronto ever since I've moved back. And I think Gesund will be the place I'll be returning to again and again :)  To begin, the place is small, comfy and welcoming! I was greeted with a friendly smile and was given ample time to relax and get ready for my massage; not a moment did I feel rushed.  I recently received a one hour long massage with Amanda (RMT) as I've always been having problems with my right shoulder...and I needed that stress relief REALLY BADLY. It had gotten to the point where I had problems sleeping, and my right shoulder was starting to really drive me nuts.  WOW. It has been a long time since I've fallen asleep during my massage! Not only that, I feel like my right shoulder was actually worked on; there was improvement in my movement and how my shoulder felt (not only right after, but the next day too; I also got better sleep)! Comparing from when I walked in to when I walked out, I feel like I can take a deep breath in again...and I haven't felt this way in months.  Usually from my experience with other places, you finish your massage, you get rushed out feeling like it wasn't even an hour (as if they started timing when you were changing) while being bombarded with products they're trying to sell you.   NOT HERE. Amanda was very kind, and offered; didn't make me feel like I "had to" buy something. A top that, Amanda had given me great advice as to at-home care! :) I always appreciate the "extra mile" when RMTs take the time to tell you how to care for yourself at home.   Overall, I can't wait to return for my next massage at Gesund!
5 I have been a patient since 2003. The first time I went I was skeptical about chiropractors but I had been dealing with gastrointestinal issues and nothing was helping, so I decided to give it a try. Within 2 visits I  felt a difference and I have been going to Dr. Jeff since.  He helped me throughout my pregnancies and I never had any back pain (an I made huge bellies) and now he even takes care of my kids. I have taken advantage of the massage services as well and I got to say I really like them and they are very affordable!!! I will definitley give Woolston Wellness Center a 5 star!!!
2 i came here because i have been having severe leg cramps for several days.  I did some research online about that and the advice is to stretch, drink lots of water, etc.  If all else fails try a muscle relaxer.  So still with leg cramps.. severe.. i came in and saw the dr.. which isnt free... and she says drink water im not giving you muscle relaxers.     No kidding dr.. i got that from google search too.  What a rip off.  If you want urgent relief do not go here!
5 Dr. Sheth is an outstanding physician. His patience, persistence and kindness are second to none. He is knowledgeable and broad expertise are impressive.  I have never had a doctor who spend so much time with me before. His staff is always friendly, helpful and polite. Thank you for everything you do!!
1 Pretty awful, so glad I was the visitor and not the patient I couldn't imagine having to stay in this place. The hospital looks very old and dirty. The staff is flakey and very difficult to get a hold of. When you do finally get to ask a question, they forget to come back or ignore the question. Nursing assistant chomped on her gum the ENTIRE time she was taking my mother's vitals. I would never elect to go to this hospital. My poor mother had no choice I would strongly urge against going to this hospital for care if at all possible.
2 Don't go here unless you want an average chiropractic visit and then be victim to an unsolicited, all-out marketing campaign. I visited him a couple times about 18 months ago and all of the sudden I am receiving weekly spam emails, mailings to my house, and even had an automated telemarketer call my cell phone on his behalf. Extremely unprofessional and tacky to resort to telemarketing.
5 Great experience.  Did the online checking.  Waited in the comfort of our home until we got the call to come down.  Was in and out in 1/2 hour.  Never had this happen to me at an urgent care before.
5 I had a terrific experience! The appointment process worked perfectly: waiting at home is much easier than waiting in a lobby. I was seen almost immediately, diagnosed, x-rayed, given prescriptions, and was on my way. Dr. Jessica Hainsfurther was clear in her explanation of my illness, and thorough in explaining my options for prescriptions. Thanks CareNow!!! Dominic Genovese
5 The staff: all of the physical therapists and assistants and even front desk attendants are so friendly and personable. If they hate their jobs, they don't show it. They're all well informed, and if they don't have an answer for you they'll find someone that does. There's always an easy going vibe, very pleasant and comfortable.   The business: there are enough private rooms so that there's almost no wait time. The gym is clean. The beds are well maintained. I always see the attendants wiping things down with sanitizer and changing the pillow cases.  No real wait for the different machines, and there are plenty of weights and band for everyone.  They have a radio that's a little outdated, and if the ultrasound machine is being used, the frequency messes with the radio. But since one of the techs likes to torture me with country music, any kind of static is good static.   People could hate coming to physical therapy. Yes, you're there to get well, but it means that something went wrong, you're broken and you need to be fixed. People could come in completely miserable, hating the hour they have to spend here, but they don't. The staff does such an amazing job of making you comfortable and helping you get well. I've caught myself hanging out a bit after I finish my therapy, just to chit chat. All of the other patients seem to share my mentality; I've yet to see one out of sorts and bad tempered. To be honest, I'll be a little sad when I'm well, and won't have a reason to come here 3 times a week. Maybe I'll get lucky and fall down some stairs at work...
5 I have been coming to the dentsl clinic for over two years!  My experience has always been positive - both with the student dentists and the licensed dental faculty.   The students are quite good at what they do, and have to have an instructor before proceeding.  It is my experience that these signoffs are not just  perfunctory - they are real.  Therefore,  the students are doing the learning and "grunt work " but the licensed dentists are on top of  everything.   The only downside I would sat is this is not fast food!  Therefore if you are always in a,hurry,  this is NOT your place.  For a regular dentist office it's always production oriented.  Every thing is is chop chop.  Not so here.  They are very good,  but speed is not part of the equation.   Based on  my experience, I recommend the Dental Clinic without  reservation.   Most people will be pleasantly surprised.
1 This place is terrible. I scheduled an appointment a week prior, took time off work (which i now have to make up), and when i got there, what do they tell me? "You're not in our system." EXCUSE ME?! I can't believe that this office is so incompetent as to forget to book an appointment properly. I cannot recommend this place to anyone. This is utterly shameful.
4 Has been our family doctor for a few years now. My biggest compliment to Dr Tsai is he listens! Really listens and asks you what you think is going on, he makes patients feel hands on with their medical care and I love that. He isn't egotistical or impatient.  He often runs late because he takes his time with his patients because he cares. I don't mind waiting because I know I'm waiting because he's giving his patients his attention. His office staff is nice and they will get you in quickly when you need it, I've called and gotten an appt. for the same day.
1 My mother has been out of a beta blocker medication for her heart for more than 1 week. We came from Kaiser system back home in California so we never had to deal with clinic type issues. Costco is my mother's pharmacy and they faxed and called in request for refill for her without any answer. The clinic apparently doesn't do prescription refills but failed to notify Costco or my mother of their policy and just ignored the requests. It took my 3 hours yesterday to call to finally speak to a person in charge to get her in ASAP to get her meds filled. She has been on the beta-blocker for over a decade and everywhere else gives her meds with enough refills for one year but apparently they can only do 6months increments. I came in with her for an infection once and it took 4 hours for her to get an simple antibiotics- for something I field diagnosed- The clinic is slow and the front officer staff are rude and clueless. I have half a mind to file a complaint with Nevada Medical Board and is considering filling a mal-practice for allowing her to be out of medication for over a week. Stay away from here. You have been warned.
5 Once again I want to say how good Cornerstone Family Practice is.  Michael Scott, my doctor is extremely professional and he cares. How many offices do you know that are still seeing patients at 7:00 PM at night?????  The office staff and support group are always on top of things..... I know that if they are running late it's because someone ahead of me  is needing extra attention. Today I needed some extra attention and was thankful for it.  I cannot recommend them enough...... I'm a senior on Medicare.....so we all know what that means.....but here they treat me like family....and I really mean that . Ciao
2 The only thing i will say is I know one of the doctor's has a policy not to return patients phone calls. I left this doctor a message asking for her to return my phone call. I received a call from staff saying this doctor does not return calls from patients unless it's a medical necessity. I'm sorry but that's wrong. If your not abusing the issue and have a concern, the doctor should call you back. I really liked her as well, so I thought this was so out of character for her. But it is what it is so i found a new doctor who doesn't share the same philosophy.
5 I really enjoy San Tan Family medicine! Dr. Lee is the nicest guy and very thorough! He was the one who found my thyroid tumor and referred me to a specialist. His medical assistants and office staff are also very nice and helpful!
1 AWFUL experience with this doctor's office every single time. They are money grubbing and you will get that feeling as soon as you walk in the door. The second appointment I had with them, I had to wait for over 45 minutes after my scheduled time in the lobby, and then another 45 minutes in the room and not so much as a, "so sorry we're running late" was uttered. Not to mention the fact that one of the PA's misdiagnosed me and it wasn't until I went to see a different doctor that I discovered the issue had continued.  The reception staff is rude and unfriendly. Most recently I had an appointment scheduled for a routine visit and an EKG which they scheduled for me on the same day. The day before, I get a call from a snotty receptionist saying  that because of "billing" purposes (AKA they want to make more money out of you), one of my appointments would have to be cancelled and I would have to see them on two separate days. When I contacted my insurance company, they were at a loss for why it would require two different visits and assured me they would have covered both. I've since changed doctor's and will NEVER visit this place ever again. Be aware folks! They make it extremely difficult to be a patient of theirs! I've since changed doctor's (who was happy to do an EKG and a physical on the same day!!) and am beyond delighted :).
5 I took my son in for a sore shoulder he received from tackle football. The front desk was friendly, we were seen right away, and the doctors were very thorough and knowledgeable of my sons diagnosis. Caring facility. It was a great experience overall!
5 I have been a patient of OTW since they opened. First I had chronic lower back pain and then hip pain. In both situations, I was thoroughly examined and carefully explained what was going on and causing my pain. I was so impressed with the time taken to do this and the physical therapy. The seemingly simple exercises that I was required to do as homework really worked!! I couldn't believe it. I would highly recommend this company to anyone suffering chronic pain.
5 I don't often think about needing Physical Therapy since I still consider myself young. I decided to check out MacroTherapy at a friend's recommendation and I'm glad I did! In my initial assessments (consultations) we uncovered several areas of pain and discomfort that I just became "used to". Through the deep tissue therapy and the physical treatment program I can "correct" where my body has over-compensated and finally get rid of this low-back pain!     The staff at MacroTherapy are very supportive of whatever you are dealing with and are very knowledgeable. I've seen people from their 20's to their 90's (I'm guessing) there and everyone seems to be happy with their service. Oh, and they accept insurance so it's like getting a massage paid by insurance too!
1 The PT is good however the staff or person answering the phone is very rude.. She was condescending, impolite and extremely rude.  The owner does not manage their staff well and allows and condones this kind of behavior.    Very disappointing and unacceptable in how their patients are treated.
1 I don't blame the people here, I blame the administration of the VA itself.   If you're not a veteran, then nothing in this review will really matter to you. If you are a veteran, you already know.  While I have injuries, they are relatively minor. I truly feel for the men and women who require constant care and have nowhere else to get it than from the VA.
1 So I booked an hour message online the night before for the next morning at 10:30am and I got an email saying your appointment has been successfully sent for 'approval'.  Okay here's the thing, I live in the neighborhood so I showed up 10 minutes early and was told it hasn't been approved.  So when we're they going to approve it?  An hour after my scheduled appointment or minutes before?  They have this sent in for 'approval' BS on their site and if you book the night before chances are they won't take you for a morning appointment. Okay it wasn't approved, shouldn't I have gotten an email before my scheduled appointment? Instead I got a 'denied' email at 10:28am after I spoke with the lady at the desk and another email 20 minutes later telling me I got 'denied' again.  Never going back here, I always book online with my rmt and never had a problem, the only reason I booked here was my regular rmt isn't available on Fridays.
2 Well I want to say everything went well til I met the doctor and I didn't see him again for over two hours. I checked in online!! Do that!  I saved my wait time in the waiting room. My appointment was for 9 pm. I came in, checked in, saw the triage nurse, and made it to my exam room within 20 minutes!! Job well done.   I came in for a broken piece of glass in my foot. I met the doctor and he ordered an X-ray. I took my X-ray and after returning to my room at 10pm, I never saw the doctor again!! It was 12.30 am and I walked out of urgent care after three and a half hours. Hopefully there was some kind of emergency, however no one spoke to me about anything.   I am sorry for this two star review. But it was really a horrible experience. I didn't go to the ER, I went to your urgent care where a person with a piece of glass in my foot should have gone. I would have expected to be in and out within a couple hours.
2 I used to be a patient here a few years back when they abruptly stopped taking my insurance with no warning. Before that, my impression of the place: Nice doc, slow doc, grumpy front desk staff. There was an older gal there so sour she makes Grumpy Cat look happy. Made you feel like she was doing you a favor just to acknowledge you. Fast forward to now. I've got a new insurance company and they sent me here. I didn't realize who they were till I got there. I hoped maybe things had gotten better over time. Nope. Same grouchy staff attitude, same slow but nice doc. I won't be going back.
4 I liked this facility.  The staff was very nice. SARA THE PA was very thorough and asked if I had any questions. She wasn't in a hurry like most.
1 The worst place. Everytime it's almost an hour past my appointment time before I get called back. Unacceptable......not to mention the last time I was the only one in the waiting room and STILL an hour past.
5 I filled out my paperwork online. The front desk was able to print it out for me to confirm and sign. Listened to me to find a resolution. Very nice and helpful. The NP/DR came up with a resolution right away and also did additional research. It is great that she explained the what and why.
2 Although the staff are very nice and the facility can accomodate a lot of people at once (ease of appointment times), I must say I was not thrilled by this place. The physical therapists are helpful, but compared to other places, are not attentive enough because they are often seeing many patients at once. I thought the service was very good until I visited other physical therapists that give much more one-on-one time and assess your progress much more closely.  Example: I was often left to do my stretches with the therapists mostly coming back to give me something else to do. Besides asking how I felt from time to time, they did not reassess my abilities to walk or stretch as other therapists have. How do they know what is working if they don't assess your progress?
1 My third and final review. If you take the time to read my previous 2 others, you will see that I genuinely tried to give this place a chance. I have come to discover that no matter how great the doctor is the staff really makes or breaks your experience....and this staff shatters it.   The wait time has seemed to improve which is great when you have a cranky infant in tow..however, the staff's attitude has not. Sorry not sorry to point fingers, Lauren at check-out is awful. I'm pretty sure if you told that girl she just won a million dollars, she would still roll her eyes at you and give you a look of disgust. Disrespectful and disgraceful. Granted, there are a few friendly faces, but we all know that people remember the negatives...  I can make it past the bad attitude but one thing that has me steaming and leaving this practice indefinitely is there billing department. Don't mess with my money!  My son is almost 10 months old, when he was 3 weeks old we had a surgical procedure performed at the office, even with really good insurance (Tricare) somehow I paid a really large premium to the office, I questioned it at the time and they assured me it's standard practice...okay fine.   Fast forward, skip the boring details. Almost 9 months later, I bring my son in for vaccines, they inform me that if I want to have the flu shot performed it's $15.00 and it is performed in 2 sets..no problem, I pay up.. second visit for the shot and the receptionist tells me I'm good to go, because Tricare pays for ALL vaccines and I never had to pay in the first place. Because I paid for the first vaccine she directs me to call the billing department and they will happily credit my account, cool.   After contacting billing 2 1/2 weeks ago now, the nice girl on the phone tells me I have not one, not two but three separate credits on my account, one from OVER A YEAR AGO, one from the surgical procedure and this most recent one....ohkaaaaayy. Why didn't you ever tell me? Why have you continued to charge me for services knowing I have a credit on my account? Whatever, nice surprise to get money back...still not mad at this point.  Here's the twist. Because we have good insurance, there's no need for a credit on the account, the money just sits there, so Sunshine Valley is nice enough to write a check for the difference (I've been through this before - but they never mentioned other credits LOL) I kindly ask the girl if she could write a check for the $200 + difference, she says they will mail it out, I ask her if she can please hold it at the desk for me as I have an appointment in 3 days and I can just pick it up like I have in the past because they failed to mail it months before, she agrees and says it will be ready FRIDAY.  Friday comes...we have to cancel appointment...I live in Mountain's Edge and this office is in Summerlin, I call to make sure check is ready before I make the drive....surprise, billing manager isn't in, she didn't process checks but it will definitely be ready Monday...  Okay fine, I call Monday, nope not Ready, come Tuesday it will definitely be here.  SURPRISE! I come in on WEDNESDAY for an appointment, at check-out I ask Lauren about the check, before I can even finish my sentence she cuts me off and tells me they mail it out....after I tell her the story she heads back to billing and tells me the billing manager "has no idea what I'm talking about and she mailed it".   OH MY GOD. The incompetence of this place is beyond ridiculous and frankly I just DON'T have the patience to deal with them any longer.  Read my reviews, very rarely will you see this. STAY FAR FAR FAR AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!! Still awaiting check that will probably never arrive.
5 I was hesitant about the value of Physical Therapy (even with a step daughter that just graduated as a PT) but after a recent fall down the stairs I was left with a very sore left bicep and shoulder. I couldn't lift a milk jug or even sleep on my left side. My doctor recommended PT. I picked Chandler PT based on their reviews. And I am glad I did!  Ashley is fantastic!  She used a variety of techniques on my arm, and combined with the assigned exercises has returned me to a fully functioning state!  Jenna is also very helpful in walking you through your exercises. Everyone there is friendly, professional, and totally focused on rehabilitating you.  I'd HIGHLY recommend and will be going back for my sore knee!
1 I unfortunately changed my insurance to Humana. It is without a doubt the worst move of my life. I have a lower back injury and have been seen by Dr Abby Wikler. I can't walk in the morning can't sleep at night and have been to his office in pain three times the past month. He told me to lift my leg up to my chest in the morning and that would fix it. I went back. I told him the pain was excruciating. I even called in on a Saturday and was called back by his arrogant brother also a DO. He told me to take ibuprofen and put ice on my back. He was a real peace of work. The next appointment he sent me finally to get an X-ray.  After that appointment and telling me my X-ray did not show anything he sent me home and told me to return in 90 days. His assistant called me to find out how I felt after the prior appointment. I told him I was in constant pain in my left butt check. He referred me to a physical therapist. I called this is what is fantastic. They could get me in thirty 30 days later. I called the office back. The secretary or moron that answered the phone would not put me through to the assistant. She told me that they had done everything they could for me. I strongly suggest if you know a witch doctor a voodoo specialist that you try them before going to these quacks. I am 70 in excellent health with the exception of this pain in my cheek and leg. They could care less. They are ripping off Medicare through Humana. This office is all about billing. They will try to do absolutely nothing for you. They bill for your visit $495 but they won't do anything for you that will cost Humana additional. I am going to the insurance and medical division in Nevada and find out if I can file a complaint against Humana and this medical practice. Practice is the right term for this group. Beware if you value your health.
1 My work place sent me to this facility to get testing done. I was greeted like this"what do you want, why are you here." As to oppose to "how are you today, how can I assist you." Very sad unhappy employees.  From the front to the back tech. No eye contact and rude.  I suppose if you hate your job that much please leave and save the patients the agony of making contact with rude service.
4 I have been coming here for years.  The staff is always polite and I have never had any issues.  I see my regular doctor and my allergist here.  While I am not a fan of co-pays for every visit, I have not had any problems with getting lab work done or identifying potential issues from my blood work.  I recommend the facility if you are in the area and in need of a family physician.
5 North Scottsdale Family Medicine is a tremendous practice. I searched long and hard to find an all around medical practice with knowledgeable, caring physicians.  Dr Paul Babey is one of the best doctors I've ever met. He is an extraordinarily skilled doctor.  My husband and I feel quite fortunate that Dr Babey is our doctor.  We recently relocated to Scottsdale full time and left a health care network that had been in place for 30+ years. Dr Babey made our relocation and the new state, new doctor(s) transition so comforting to us.  I highly recommend this practice to anyone looking for a new doctor or perhaps considering changing doctors.
5 I've been to Emkiro a number of times, to the medical walk-in clinic and the Chiropractor. I like their appointment system for the walk-in and I don't think I've ever waited longer than 20 minutes.  Dr. Mohabir is pleasant and helpful.  And then I started seeing Dr. Kang for my back issues and IT band syndrome. Holy cow, after just 3 or 4 visits I was a new person. No more headaches! The IT band took a while to get better, it was very tight from running. But the acupuncture really helped and I like that Dr. Kang does taping as well.  Can't complain about the front staff at all. Maybe they changed, but all of them are very nice and helpful
1 My hubby & I visited Zen for a couples massage recently, it was alright....  We were not very impressed with our overall experience.    I booked a couples massage way in advance for a "special rate" over the Valentines weekend, and was told the price would be $89-99 total, plus tip (depending on if you got a Swedish or deep tissue for 1 hour each).  We go to check out  and tipped at least 20 percent, signed the receipt and left.  The next day I noticed a charge for 145 dollars on my checking account.   For a couples 1 hour massage, I thought it was really high.  I called Zen and the receptionist explained to me that in order to get the rate of what I was told over the phone way back in the beginning of February, I would get for the couples massage, was buying gift cards first and then redeeming them.  Not one staff member informed me of this or anything, I expressed my disappointment and how I was told it would be 99 for a swedish and deep tissue, etc.  All she could say was, "sorry."    I was hoping she would make it right and honor the price her employee told me.. She did not even hesitate to make it right, just says sorry and that was it.  We will never be going back here again.  Thank you for the over priced massages, crappy customer service and lack of trained employees, ZEN.
4 Agreed... as a multi-sport athlete I've unfortunately had to basically live in physio for various complaints... it's always tough to find a good place when you move cities as often as I, but Kim at AA has been excellent.
1 They were friendly and nice. But if you want to follow up you must go back there and pay another doctor visits. What kind of crap is that. I was diagnose with gout. And three weeks has passed and it's has not been resolved. I called and asked to see if there was something that I can do to help resolve this issue. My only respond from Maria was to come back and get an exam again. I don't understand, we know what the issue is. What can we do to resolve it? Common sense. But I guess the dollar signs were flashing. Please find some good help.
5 Dr Jeffrey is so accommodating to my chiropractic needs.  I have never had an issue scheduling and can walk in during an emergency.  April in the front is very helpful and ALL the massage therapists have been great.  Michelle is my fav just because she understands my medical conditions and is always open to talking about them and gives me suggestions and advice.  Glad I found this office...
5 Ok' long story short - got a 2 weeks of unlimited yoga for $20 coupon in the mail, decided to give it a try.  You have to show up at least 15min in advance to register, well I did my registration and reservation for a class on their web site which is very convenient.  The yoga studio is very clean and very hot :) but that's what hot yoga is supposed to be like right? Overall awesome experience, and I most likely will need to buy more classes once this 2 week trial is over.
5 My mom wanted me to find a new family dr for her, so as always I looked on yelp. I saw that Dr Reed's office is walking distance from my house and got really good reviews. We decided to check this doctor out. All I can say is wow! This dr is super patient and very nice. I know Doctors should be nice to patients in general, but that's not always the case. He's a young doctor, but don't let that fool you because he's awesome!
5 I've been going to Don Nobis for a little over two months. He is one of the sweetest doctors I've seen.  The other therapists Mark and Matt are just as nice and I never thought my pain would go away.  But surely it has.  It's still there but compared to where I was we've made major progress.   I had went to another therapist Matt Smith. They ignored me and gave me stuff I could do at home.  Here at Don's practice they take care of you.
4 I went the other day for the first time and I can only say WOW. I had to wait 40 minutes to be seen but the doctor multiple times reassure me she was going to be done soon which I liked and I was in no hurry. When it was my turn she asked me multiple questions and she sat back to think what could my diagnosis be. I really liked that she took time to think instead of just telling me right aways just to get more money or sent me a prescription. This is clinic was clean and the personal was friendly. I recommend it for minor things instead of going to urgent care.
5 I was referred to (Dr.) Albert Or by a friend.  Albert Or  is very personable, likable and he listens to you.  I did not feel rushed - as you do with others. He gave me some very good advise and I am very pleased with the outcome. I would recommend him to anyone.  He very Good.
5 I can't recommend the quality care and genuine kindness of this practice! Dr Josh loves his patients and has built a practice based on his desire to help everyone live their best, healthiest life. I have seen both Dr Josh and Dr Tracy, and they are both wonderful doctors and people. They are skilled healers and are interested in their patients' lives.  The entire staff treats everyone like a good friend, so the feeling good vibes start as soon as you walk in the door! The combination of stretching, strengthening, and adjustments have greatly improved my neck and back, and regular visits to this office have been the most effective in managing my headaches and hip pain.  There are some extra fun bonuses that make this office standout. They have an amazing massage therapist, they have super fun events like Ladies' Night, and they are super KID FRIENDLY! There's a fun little corner for kids to play, and everyone (especially Colby) likes to dote on the little visitors.
5 Amazing therapy, very home like feel in the office. the Dr. Is great and the massage therapists really know what they're doing! Always feeling rejuvenated when I leave :)
1 I love Dr. Leepard as a doctor, but she is never on time. If you do not get the first available appointment in the morning you can plan to wait at least two hours before you are seeing. And the scheduling department is even worse. I scheduled an appointment for one day and when I came in I was told that the appointment date has been moved to another date without my knowledge. So inconsiderate for peoples time. I will be finding a new doctor.
5 I recently started working with Mark, who is based at the Scottsdale location.  He is one of the most knowledgeable therapists I have worked with.  He is also personable and empathetic not to mention very nice to work with.  The rest of the staff is also rather awesome to deal with.  Hurt?  Well, after you talk to a doctor, I would personally suggest you talk to these folks.  There is also a Goodyear office too, and though I have not been, they're likely just as good.    Not often I offer 5 stars, but 5/5.
1 I can't give a zero star review because it won't let me. I'm writing this while I'm waiting in the exam room. Called, received a 1130am appt. Arrived by 1115am, it's 1230pm and still haven't been seen. All I need is a new prescription for my allergies.
5 I am a current patient at Verve and have been for ten years on and off.  I have been involved in numerous vehicle accidents throughout the years and every time I return to Verve Chiropractic because they are the best in quality, fastest health improvement, cleanliness, and customer service.  Dr. David Warkentin's motto is that the sooner he heals you the better for all.  Dr. David Warkentin, Dr. Fuentes, and Dr. Wolsey are extraordinary.  David Warkentin is not only a top doctor, but a highly knowledgeable, intelligent, and very social person.  Every time I go to Verve they heal my back muscles, nerves, or discs injuries very well. Thank God for Dr. Warkentin and his staff!  Thanks to them I have avoided disc herniation surgery, etc.   I have received chiropractic care from other doctors, but none come close to Verve.  Dr. Fuentes is awesome! Dr. Fuentes is a quality doctor as well.  Fuentes is sympathetic and always tries to accommodate me and my children so that we can have an enjoyable experience while providing quality health care.  Even my seven year old wants to go to therapy with me.  I recommend Verve all the time to law enforcement officers, children, and adults.  I had a great experience with Verve's pain management institute as well.  I am so glad they are available to aid with pain management in conjunction with the physical therapy, its great!  If you were involved in a car accident, lifting or posture injury, or just need physical therapy don't go anywhere else.....Verve Chiropractic is your answer for quality and speedy health!  Just go at least once and you will know you are in the right place, I promise.
4 I have seen a rep from CSC at two different events now in Charlotte. Most recently it was at the Charlotte 10 Miler in Balantyne. But the most memorable time was back in the summer at the 24 Hours of Booty ride in Charlotte. One of their doctors(?) was on site doing massage, stretching and perhaps mild adjustments and giving some consultation advice. I felt thoroughly pleased with the service and took a card swearing I'd be into the clinic to have a full review of my physical well being. Well being is perhaps not the best wording to use though, as I'm physically just tense and broken everywhere.  I've been to a very basic chiropractor before. By basic I mean they churn you out like you're on an assembly line. Wait in a waiting room, they say "next", you come in, crack your neck and back and send you away in about 10 minutes or less. That's it. But that's not CSC. Here they go above and beyond "basic chiropractor". Before you get an adjustment you'll go through an orientation of sorts where they analyze how you're standing or sitting or whatever you're doing wrong to hurt yourself. They'll give you a list of exercises to do when you're not in the clinic getting adjusted or stretched. In the clinic they will do a light sort of massage to loosen up and stretch out your tense muscles prior to performing an adjustment on you. After a thorough adjustment you will be attached to some electrodes (I'm not sure specifically what the device is called) which vibrate your muscles to help relieve a bit of the potential pain after your adjustment. At least in my case they applied some KT tape as a "gentle reminder" to maintain my proper posture to prevent the pain from recurring so frequently.  They're very friendly and accommodating and have an almost communal layout here for the physical therapy/chiropractic functions. I do pay quite a bit more than I did with my previous chiropractor ($65/visit here) however I'd say it's worth the improved quality of the treatment. As I loosen up more and build up the courage I may try some dry needling to see if that works too. But really, I'm just learning more about my body's "bad habits" and ways at this point - they do an excellent job of sharing that. By the way, this is my shout-out for Dr. Torres as she is the one I have been seeing.
4 My son and I both enjoy going to see Dr.Laura, she's very nice and professional. The trips are always quick and painless, I've never waited more than 20 minutes. This is even more amazing when you add in the fact that dr.laura does not make you feel rushed at all and gives you time to discuss your child's health. The nurses can feel a little tense sometimes, but what job doesn't get a little stressful.
5 I highly recommend checking this place out. The atmosphere alone on the inside is amazing. You're instantly comfortable and surrounded by positive and healing energy. Rosemarie did an excellent job both educating and treating me. After treatment they take the time to help you understand how to self treat at home between sessions. I will definitely be going back!
1 DO NOT SEND YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS HERE IF YOU WANT THEM TO LIVE!!!!This is an awful place! The dogs at the pound get better treatment. If you care about your family member DO NOT SEND THEM HERE!!! my grand mother went there after a bad fall where she hurt her knee. A doctor never even looked at her knee and they never did any physical therapy. They didn't even get her out of bed! They ended up giving medicane she was highly allergic to which was in her chart. This caused her kidneys to start failing and she ended up with C-diff in isolation. They just started hooking things up to the IV not even telling her what they were. One of which was a seditive they gave her everyday. Stoped her from asking questions. They even took the phone out of the room so we couldn't get a hold of her. It gets worse the cleaning people STOLE ALL HER BELONGINGS including her glasses that she can not see without! Now she is in intensive care in the hospital and hasn't been out of bed for 3 months and will proably never be able to recover. Horrible because she only hurt her knee and now she might die because they just don't care.
5 I must say I am absolutely impressed with the service I received from Warner Family Practice. I'm fairly new to the Chandler area so I when I came down with a sore throat last week I tried calling two other practices to make a Tuesday morning appointment and had zero luck. I read through the Yelp reviews for this place and decided to give WFP a ring. I called at 8:00 on a Tuesday and they were able to schedule me in for 11:40 that afternoon.   -I arrive at 11:30 and was pleasantly surprised by the "fancy" lobby. It was spacious, clean, tech-savvy, and even had a beautiful aquarium.  -The receptionist had me check in right away and while she was scanning in my insurance card, the lady called my name to come back!!! I am not kidding, it took all of three minutes for me to check in and be called back. I've never had such a quick and efficient "lobby experience".  -The friendly nurse gets the basic information and asks me a to go through a survey since I am a first-time patient. This place has some money because there was a printer in the patient room, she was typing my information into a lap top and everyone was carrying around a sort of Ipad to take notes on. Awesome.  -Dr. Tsai came into the room right after the survey, listened to my concerns and gave me solutions to my problems. He was kind, patient and took his time which again I find a somewhat unique experience for a doctor's appointment. He referred me to the lab at 12:04.  -I was referred to blood work in their in-house lab, waited again for only a few minutes and then went through a quick blood sample. This was over before I knew it and I was out the door by 12:15!  Even though the appointment flew by I never felt rushed. Warner Family Practice is efficient, professional and friendly and I will absolutely be returning, I'm even making my husband switch over to this place! :)
1 Would rather die of pneumonia than subject myself to the staff at this location again.       I sincerely hope the MD's working at this location seek more fulfilling employment as this location is an embarrassment to the health care industry.  I would have given them zero stars if it was an option.  Its a sad day in American health care when locations that claim to offer "urgent care" are neither urgent nor caring.  I have been to this location multiple times over the last few years for the flu, bronchitis, and immediate back issues.   The service gets worse every time.  The staff at this location has as much compassion as a 2x4, and treats their patients like garbage, just take a look at previous reviews for further confirmation.            Jenny at the front desk really sets the mood with her unpleasant attitude and condescending tone. She treats people who are supposed to be patients and customers for this location like subhuman wastes of her time.  I mean, god forbid an ill person not be the most jovial individual on the planet.  In the medical field you need to understand the people coming to your business are hurting not feeling well and probably will not be in the best mood, your job is to be compassionate, communicate clearly, and give them reasonable expectations of the care they are to expect.  This location clearly does not believe any of that should be considered, you are a co-pay, a dollar sign, a piece of meat at this location just helping them keep the lights on.  When I have actually made it through the gauntlet of lazy, rude, condescending, unprofessional individuals working the front of house the doctors have typically been attentive and helpful, so its unfortunate that I write this review.  I truly believe the doctors that work here probably truly care about their patients and their health, unfortunately the front of house pushes patients elsewhere with their poor tact, patient handling, and customer service skills.  After poor communication, a couple of condescending comments, and a nurse who waited 18min to check me in.  (she held my license and insurance for almost 20min before checking me in so it only showed I was there for a shorter period of time) I decided to take my illness elsewhere.  UMC Urgent Care was actually compassionate, friendly, understanding, and helped me with my needs unlike the unfriendly folks at UC.         As someone who grew up around medical professionals this is not how you treat patients.  I will never return and would recommend you avoid this location unless your looking to be insulted, lied to, and ridiculed while seeking treatment for an illness.  In closing, its sad when my dog has the luxury of seeing more caring, friendly, and punctual doctors/vets at Banfield Pet Hospital that at an Urgent Care location for humans.           Sincerely,   A Sick Patient
5 If you are looking for a caring Dr. Don't look and further. Dr. Tafreshi is extremely knowledgeable and knows what he is doing. I have been his patient for over 7 years and can not say anything bad. Office gets busy at times, but that is because he is a good Dr. and in high demand.
1 Zumindest mir konnte nicht geholfen werden. Therapie war eher konzeptlos.
5 I've been going to this hot yoga studio regularly since 2010 and I absolutely love it. My favorite things about it are that it's 1) a really tough, super sweaty workout 2) set to great music 3) in a non-intimidating environment. I don't know the owner well, but whenever I do see her she is always super sweet. I personally love the family pictures she has up in the studio - her family works there, too, and it gives off a welcoming vibe. And to the girl who criticized those pictures in her review, maybe you're the sweaty (and judgy) Regina George? Because this place rocks.
5 I started going to Physio Therapy Associate when I broke my wrist.  All the workers there are wonderful.  They made me feel welcomed and appreciate me as a client. Erin is my primary therapist but everyone helps you.   Bobby, Jennifer and Steve helped me also.  After the therapy for the broken wrist I went back for my balance problems.  I would highly recommend this place.
5 Needed to hit up a walk-in and checked Yelp for some recommendations.  This place had glowing reviews and was on my way to work -- very convenient! I don't think I was waiting for even five minutes before my name was called. Dr. Chu was fantastic! Very friendly and helpful. It was nothing major whatsoever, but always nice to have a reassuring opinion.  Definitely coming here again when I can't make it to my family doctor. Location is beyond convenient for me, the reception & waiting room are spacious and clean, and I was blown away by how quickly I was helped at 8:30am on a weekday!
5 I am so impressed with Dr. Cas and the staff.  They spend so much time on you unlike those quick in-and-out chiropractic offices.  Dr. Cas spent a lot of time going over my x-rays and explained every bone and muscle that was compromised.  They always take their time and are completely amazing.  I would highly recommend this place!
1 I recently arrived in Az and wanted to find continuing care for my disease before I ran out of medication. Dr Shipon immediately told me my meds were wrong. She gave me a very basic few tests and a urine screen and told me to come back in a week when they got my urine test back. She also wanted me to get around 10 new xrays, even though I told her to get my med records from my 10 year long doctor in CA. When I came back the next week, the new nurse came in to see me and started pulling and pushing on my joints, which caused me more pain for two days afterwards, and then said that my urine tested for marijuana and I could not get meds for six weeks. I said that I had written on the intake form, that I was trying the marijuana that week, since I was moving and that I didn't like it. She then said too bad, but well give you some other drug so you don't have withdrawals from my regular drugs. I was shocked at the  cookie cutter treatment that I received. It seems from my two experiences with pain management that they think everyone that seeks help there, is a drug addict. It horrifies me to think that the people in the world who need this kind of care, are the forgotten souls, that no one thinks/cares about, because drug addicts get all of the attention. It's already a huge hassle to get your meds every month, being treated badly on top of your daily struggles is reprehensible. I feel this place has no compassion, it's just a business.
4 Been here twice - both times were really pleasant experiences.  The first time, I had a session with a nice girl named Victoria. I had some major stiffness on my shoulders and back and after a 90 minute session with her, I felt a lot better.  A few weeks later, I had a day off and decided to treat myself to a massage and had a session with another person (a nice Japanese lady, who I forget the name of unfortunately). But she was really helpful and even gave me a 5 minute consultation afterward to suggest some simple exercises to help me stretch out my problematic back muscles.  All in all, the staff are all very friendly, I'd totally come back again!
5 Dr. Dominic Pisaro is truly a "Health Care Quarterback".  With his background in both Chiropractic and Physical Therapy, HE DELIVERS RESULTS!  What I appreciate about "Dr. Dom" is that he had a game-plan to get my overuse injuries addressed, as well as a home maintenance plan to prevent reinjury.  As we finish out our sessions I want to say thank you for Dr. Dom and his clinic-staff.  Integrity and trust are what they have earned with me.
4 I have no idea why this place has such negative reviews. I've been coming here for over 5 years now. People have complained about the transition- they clearly don't understand that every place has a transitional period and that takes time. The new equipment is awesome. I've never had a problem with cleanliness. You can't please everyone, but complaining about them changing their class schedules? You obviously don't realize that instructors have their own personal lives as well. The staff have always been nothing but wonderful. The childcare girls have always been great and know our son by name. They even color and cutout sharks for him. The changes I've seen from Gold's to EOS have been nothing but positive.
5 This is the only place in town I would recommend for PT. All of the exercise technicians are very patient. The front desk people are amazing. Jimmy P and Jim are a dynamic duo. You will get the best care here and they make sure your doing what you need to do in order to heal properly.
1 Very negative experience. I have been here only a couple of times, but the experience was disappointing and just rude each time. I have never seen such shameless product pushing in my life, prior to ANY skin consultation when you go into the room they already have a long specific sheet of their products written up for you. Yet, they are hardly familiar with their own Obagi products just push them with zero knowledge. I tried to receive some form of consultation from the woman I was working with, however she could not have been more unwilling. I'm not sure my skin was ever looked at for more than a split second the whole time I was there. Just totally rushed out each time, and each time I waited for my appointment (which I get happens), but I've never waited 10-15 min to simply pay while watching the four receptionists just sit and gossip with each other. Just awful, nothing like what I have experienced elsewhere from similar skin centers. Do not waste your money.
1 I found this place of Groupon  it was $41 for a 60 minute massage. I then began to research Damon for reviews and I liked what I read so I purchased the Groupon. Let me tell you that it is not a 60 minute massage. Damon is a physical therapist not a massage therapist! This is false advertisement my massage was about 15 mins! It was a waste of time and money. I live in the northwest area and decided to drive all the way to Henderson for a physical therapy exam and lecture rather than a 60 min massage which I thought I had paid for. If you are seeking a massage this is not the place. If you are seeking physical therapy try him out. I was very disappointed that I was tricked into this purchase.
3 Dr. Phillips care is second to none and have heard the same holds true for the other two doctors but the office staff and nurses are another story.    Yesterday I walked-in at 215pm, as they allow before 3pm.  I was surprisingly in a room by 230pm. After about an hour of sitting in there, which I would expect as I did walk-in instead of having an appt, I heard a nurse say... "Who's in that room?" And someone replying, "A walk-in." To which the nurse replies, "Oh great, another 330pm walk-in guy..." And the rest was muffled.  If they are going to pretend to be pleasant to my face, they can at least have the courtesy to go outside or away from my room to talk trash.    At 400pm I could still hear a few remarks and when I opened the door to ask where the restroom was, one of them gave me a dirty look so I just left...  Great doctors but not sure it's worth the hassle of the rest of them making me feel like crap for coming in without an appt due to my work schedule.    If the office staff doesn't like late walk-ins, meaning before 3pm, change the time from 3pm to something else.
2 Disclaimer: I have a chronic but undiagnosed autoimmune condition, so my situation is more complicated than the average client. If you're coming here for something trivial like a check-up or cold medicine you're probably fine.  That said, the first two times I saw Brandi and she was kind and sympathetic. She was uncomfortable with the doses of prednisone she was prescribing, however, and referred me to (Curtis) Page. Cue the worst doctor experience I have ever had in my life (and I have had a LOT of experiences with new doctors):  Within a few moments of me trying to explain a complicated 10+ year medical history, he seemed to have already developed a diagnosis in his head. He was dismissive and rude, and almost flat-out refused to give me the prescription I needed, favoring instead medicine that I explained I've tried before and hadn't had enough of an effect.  He finally gave in to prescribing prednisone, "2 refills or whatever she wants" and stormed out like he lost an argument. Which is good because at that point I was already in tears and was just relieved to have ann opportunity to cry in peace. I can't remember the last time, if ever, that a doctor visit made me cry.  He also had two medical students with him. I was never asked for my preference on whether they were in the room or not. This is one of the few times I would have wished they weren't there actually. All I can hope is they don't pick up his bedside manner.
1 appointment time 10 am, not seen until after 11. Wait time is disrespectful. Staff is nice at the front desk but the doctors are rude to their customers by spending so little time with them and making them wait such an excessive amount of time
5 I came here recently, and was very happy with the office.  The place was very clean, and everyone was friendly.  I had my six year old daughter with me, and she loved the doctor.  I love that they can fill prescriptions right on site - That is definitely a convenience for some.  We would go back without any hesitation if needed.
1 I've been to this location over 5 times and it gets worse with every visit. Its only positive attribute is that it is clean.  This is why I have kept coming back. I am determined to find a new clean quick care after today. The staff was unprofessional and the wait time was terrible. There were only 5 people here before me and I waited over 2 hours to be called.        My first experience here was great. But, every time I come back the staff has changed and the wait gets longer. This place sucks.
3 It's definitely not the nicest or most up to date hospital but when my roommate was carried in to our house by a cab driver completely unresponsive to verbal cues or even me pinching him as hard as I could. They managed to wake him up and let us take him back home without any charges. Obviously that says little about how they can handle other more complicated issues but if your worried your friend has serious alcohol poisoning it's a good place to go.
5 I'm pretty open minded about the type of care I receive so I finally decided to try a Naturopathic route and I chose to see Dr. Ezrre based off her profile on the website. And I have to say she was the perfect choice for me. I've never had a Dr pay so much attention to me and getting to know my health history. It was a unique experience and I left happy and content with my service! It was pricey paying out of pocket but totally worth it!! I received a B 12 shot also and I'm excited to see how it helps me as the week progresses. Dr. Ezrre is very nice and knowledgeable, she is easy to talk to and has solutions for your needs. I would highly recommend this office for your health care needs.
3 Iasis has gone downhill the last few years. In the age of squeezing every penny they can out a diminishing return healthcare, you see it the staff treatment, (both received and given), and shape of the hosptial and equipment.
5 I had never been to a chiropractor before but since I have been seeing Dr. Wallace my life has been a lot better. He is truly a life saver for me. I appreciate the time he spends with me and his overall knowledge.
2 Was not happy with care of my father. I go to Dean, but my father had a very bad finger injury and needed to go to his health care provider.  I was shocked by the contrast. VERY long wait and the staff continually talked and complained.  I am not one to give bad reviews but since it was obvious I was not the only one upset in the waiting room, I thought some feedback/review should be done.
5 Been seeing Dr Ross for many years now and he's one of the best Doctors I've had the pleasure of visiting.
5 I located Dr. Levins via my health provider's physician listings.  I did a search for doctors within 5 miles of my home zip code of 85251 and it returned nearly 500 results, and when that happens - I look for a Wisconsinite.  While Dr. Levins may have not grown up in Wisconsin, he earned his degree at the Medical College of Wisconsin, and that was enough for me.  For the record, this strategy of locating Wisconsin-trained physicians hasn't failed me yet - in any region of the country I've lived in.  I know its a funny way of locating doctors, but I'm a funny guy...  The purpose of my visit was very general, as I hadn't had a basic checkup in a long time, however Dr. Levins was thorough - more thorough than any doctor I've visited has been in a very long time.  We spent a great deal of time just talking - about my prior medical history, my current lifestyle habits, as well as my overall mind-body state.  He shared personal insight as we discussed my health, and I found it extremely helpful.  I will be keeping Dr. Levins as a primary care physician as long as keep myself in this valley.  He is someone I know I can trust, and he is a great listener.  He goes into great detail when discussing physiology, and answered all my questions in an easy-to-understand manner - which many physicians don't do, or do with great reluctance.  As of this review, Dr. Levins is accepting new patients.  If you need a doctor in the Old Town Scottsdale area, give him a try.
5 Dr. Sharma was AMAZING! I don't have insurance so he gave me a very reasonable rate for my visit. he also did not charge me for my return visit and gave me the instructions to get a better rate for my prescriptions. very professional, helpful and genuine... which is not usually the case at a doctors office. thank you doctor! I will be back!
1 Here I am, stressed. I've been seeing the dr's at Norterra for years. Their ability to provide 1:1 consultation has gradually had lost my confidence in their practice. Overall, each time I'm seen by a Provider my results are continue to change. In every visit, they ask for blood work. Each time results come back they give me a call in order to discuss my results, with a deductible fee. The practice is "banking" on patients, just to discuss results. I've never quiet understood why I have pay on a blood results, why can't it be link to the original visit? This is so unethical! As s single income household , I don't budget, just to sit and discuss results. These ladies are not working for the best interest of their patients. They are working for the best interest of themselves. Seriously, I am moving on, to where my health is valued by a Provider who have higher moral standards in people's lives.
1 First off u wait... And wait... Then wait some more. U tell the doctor the issue u are having and instead of thinking outside the box he will have u complete a survey to fit u into a box just to find out he wont help u or find any kind of alternate treatment. He looks out for his best interest before considering what may help...they have a god complex. Stay away
5 I have been seeing Mihaela for massage therapy for about two years now. I originally found her just through google when I moved to Roncesvalles. She is a fantastic RMT, both professional and warm. She is very committed to her craft and wellness overall and I appreciate that she listens to what you need. I also find the old church she is located in (which also houses yoga studios and other types of wellness services) to be a very peaceful and relaxing place to visit. My boyfriend also sees Mihaela regularly for RMT and would also give 5 stars!
1 NO! I'm sure if you're a long term patient and you've established a good repertoire with a doctor you're singing psalms but those whom are new and want an established physician who follows up with your medical history and desires to give you a full physical examination I would tell you to go somewhere else! I don't recommend this outfit because, frankly, they are too busy to practice medical awareness and professional expediency upon your.medical concerns or conditions. Walk away and get someone else. This FIRM lacks professional courtesy to return your emails or calls and if they do so, they do it begrudgingly. They may have plush furniture and pleasant cascading waterfalls as well as flat screen TVs but the epiphanic reality is do you really want to trust your well being to a bunch of pompous condescending insensitive sloths? There are far better caring physicians than this pathetic outfit!
5 I love this place! I have been able to get into them the same day every single time. They have appointments in the morning and evening. Prescriptions and tests are easy. They send them electronically so I do not have to carry all that paper. I have never waited more than 5 minutes to be seen. I am never rushed. I asked that I not be called in for an appointment for test results unless it is serious and cannot be told over the phone. They have accommodated that request every time. The first time they called with tests results and asked me to come in. I did. I let them know my preference again, concerned they would not accommodate, but she promptly apologized, and this has not been an issue since. The only reason it happened that time was lack of communication. The nurse had been so prompt at reaching me that the doc had not yet had the chance to tell her I could be told over the phone. I was impressed that this was the reason. They obviously care. Everyone smiles and laughs with me. They even joke once they realize they can joke with me. It feels fun, friendly, and kind of caring like family. I hope they stick around. I have been looking for a good doctor, and I think I have found one here. If you see a review I wrote about another practice in Maricopa, you will understand this next part better. I had a bad experience with the other practice. I left there and came here. Renaissance was wonderful. They saw us same day and quickly. There was no hassle at all!
4 BACKFIT is a unique experience in Palmer chiropractic, that draws physical therapy at every visit into the preparations for being treated by the doctors.  This office has an open, lighthearted feel and the staff is very personal and personable.  And there's usually an awesome "special" to introduce you to their program, meet the staff, and welcome you to consider BACKFIT.    If you are serious and committed to improving your condition, the staff will create a series-package custom-made for you, and develop an economical pre-pay arrangement to encourage you to see it through...and be with you every step of the way.
1 If I could... I would seriously give this place 0 stars! THIS IS A MEDICAL CENTER! You are supposed to be acting like doctors, nurses, etc... but I feel like I came to jail or something around that atmosphere. I have something to say about the front desk ladies.. on their faces they have a look of "I don't give a damn". Also, the nurse that called us in with short red spikey hair she had the same look on her face too and was super rude. Very rude service being that they are working at a medical place. I'm surprised I am even writing a review about a medical place.. shouldn't I be reviewing like a restaurant or something?! pathetic... If I was going to UCLA hospital, USC hospital, John Hopkins Hospital or another hospital in the world, they would not give me this kind of bad treatment. I don't know where these assistants/doctors graduated from but they sure don't know what they are doing or how to treat patients in the right manner.   My grandpa went to go get a checkup here and the doctor said he was all fine and he did not have to worry about anything anymore. As soon as my grandpa got home, he finds that the doctor made a mistake and we waste gas by driving all the way down there again and that is when all the rude service began to be thrown at us.   I suggest or recommend to go to a different medical center / hospital please! I am doing everyone a favor out there. If you are sick or in urgent need.. rude people are the last thing you need to deal with!
5 Dr Tsai is as good as a doctor as you can expect.  Takes the time to listen to all concerns and addresses them appropriately.  If you have a real medical problem or simply need to see him for preventive care, he's your doctor.  If you're a drug addict looking to con a physician for a narcotic prescription, look elsewhere.
1 Not a good experience,  I went with my husband for a physical and they didn't do anything.  All they did was send him to another doctor for a colonoscopy. No blood work or tests of any kind.  I  specifically asked for my husband to be given a  complete physical including a shingles shot,  which they refused to give him.
5 My visit to My Dr Now, was overall very good, i did not have to wait to long.  Delana was friendly, she listened to what I had to say  and she did rush me through. All the employees were very friendly nice atmosphere here.
5 It took me less time to draw blood than to draw tears because I did not have an appointment.  Excellent facilities. The interaction with patients is quick and professional. When you need to test your health..
4 Chiropractor's office attached to the Gold's Gym at 83rd and Thunderbird. We went here after a subpar experience somewhere else, and were definitely impressed. Dr Stamp works m/w/f and always has a few minutes to chat or offer advice between seeing patients or while doing paperwork. He was the first chiro I've been to who actually asked me where I hurt THEN did adjustments specifically to fix that. I had ribs out of whack and a few other things and he put them all back. And he was comfortable working on my above-average sized husband, which some chiropractors aren't. I would have liked to be shown more stretches and such to do so I won't be back as often. They are great at working with your insurance and finances- they have a deal where for $199 you can go as many times as you want in a month. You do have to sign up for 2 months back to back, but it is still a good deal. Only downfall here is that their cash rate is higher if you don't have insurance. It is $50 cash for an adjustment, but only $35 if you have insurance. That's true whether or not you even opt to have them bill your insurance. I think they take walk-ins, but if nothing else we have been able to call and get same-day appointments pretty consistently.
1 If you want quick, helpful, or professional medical services - DO NOT GO TO THIS URGENT CARE!! We were looking for a simple procedure for our son that we asked if they could provide upon arrival. Of course the response was yes, but three hours later we did not receive any help and were turned away with a useless prescription that was no longer medically prescribed. The doctor hurt our son, didn't apologized - laughed about it even. The front desk and nurse were rude, doctor didn't wear a coat and had a nose ring. This place is terribly run and we have serious doubts as to their medical capabilities.
5 I have been coming to this gym for a couple of weeks now through my friend who has a Gold Plus membership. After receiving a text from one of the representatives, I came down again and decided to start my own membership.  I don't live particularly close to this location. EOS has a new location opening on Russell and Pecos, which is closer to me, so I pre-enrolled there. The customer service at the enrollment center for the Pecos gym was sub par and instructions were confusing considering that they are not even opening for a couple more months.  That's where EOS Centennial saves the day! I went down this morning and was assisted by Preston who had reached out to me about starting my own membership. I took it as a sign and went down there. Preston provided 10x better service than the Pecos location and got me set up quickly. He was personable and interested in my goals. I got an even better deal on my membership than I did at Pecos and instructions were clearer. I was very happy about that and the staff made a good first impression.  I have been a member at every other major gym in town, you name it: 24 hour, LVAC, and Planet Fitness. I was never satisfied before, but EOS provides me with what I've been searching for for so long and for a very affordable price: lots of cardio equipment, a diverse variety of weights, pool, sauna, classes, a cinema room, and with my Gold Plus membership, I get to bring a guest to motivate me! I'm very impressed and excited to hopefully make this my permanent gym home.
3 Urgent Care isn't the type of place you're clamoring to go to, but if I had a choice between this or a hospital, then this would definitely be my choice.  My most recent trip here was to get a tetanus shot, considering that I needed a booster & may have gotten tetanus....a good reason to go if you ask me. Anyways, the wait wasn't too bad & I wasn't in any pain so it seemed like a quick process. Everything went pretty smoothly & I got my booster shot within a hour or so. It was also much cheaper than an ER visit, so add that to the reasons I'd rather go here than a hospital.
1 I have been seeing Dr. Forte for a couple years and coming to the practice for 3 years all the while recommending it to others. I've watched it steadily go downhill for the past 2 years as the business has grown. I respected her initially and loved her P.A. Who has since left (Susan).  This office has turned into a money hungry rude place that really doesn't care about people. They don't care if your sick and don't care about your recovery. They care about more office visits and billing your insurance.  My latest visit was because I have a horrible case of the flu. I waited in the waiting room for about an hour (this is actually good for them) but then waited another 45 minutes inside the room for the dr.  I had been running a fever for about 5 days and feeling a bit hazy. She prescribed augmenten. It didn't click at the time but I had a horrible experience with that drug about a year ago and had to change to another antibiotic. Was this not in my chart?  I don't think they look at the charts. And I would lay money that they get kickbacks from the drug company who makes augmenten. They're not concerned with what is best for the patients' care. They also sent me for a chest X-ray. I went right away to have that done.  I thought it was weird that they didn't give me any instructions about how or when I would get the results of the X-ray. I called the next day and they seemed irritated at the call and said if everything was normal they wouldn't notify me. During the office visit the dr. Asked if I'd had blood work done recently. I said yes months ago and that I had never been notified of the results. I asked if it was in my chart. She flipped through my chart seeming a bit irritated!  How is this possible. It's apparent that this office is extremely unorganized and doesn't have a handle on what's going on with their patients.  Today I realized the augmenten she told me would be five days of 2 pills per day was actually 7 days. Seriously? The dr. Didn't even know the dosage!! I called at 8am because the drug destroys my stomach. I can't seem to tolerate food or even water when taking it. They again were irritated at the call but took my info saying they would call me back after talking to the dr.  At 3:40 they still hadn't called me back. I called was put on hold then told I could come pick up my new prescription. They are unable to call in perceptions. I'm done with this place and may be taking this a step further. I think they are becoming dangerous.
5 Have seen Courtney and Dr. Hailstone and both were very professional and knowledgeable. I recently moved to Las Vegas and I'm very pleased with this office and the care I have received.
5 I was in a car accident in the middle of March 2016 and my lawyer recommended this place to me. I've never been in therapy before but coming here was probably the best decision I've made in awhile. The Neck and Back team were so polite and caring that I felt like family every time I came here. I never waited more than five minutes when I arrived and the exercises Dr. Sims set up for me had me healed within 2 months.   If you're injured whether it be an accident or just because you have pain in your neck or back, come here! You won't regret it!
5 Having taken very few yoga classes in my life and being an anti-sweat kind of girl, I was very nervous about my first bikram class. But everyone is very welcoming and understanding of the mixture of levels in the class. I signed up for the 2-week trial and went almost every day. The instructors are all friendly and approachable before and after class. Not being familiar with the poses, I'm thankful for the pointers given during the class as well.  The yoga room fits about 50 students and is typically close to full, so it's good to get there early and claim your spot. Now that my 2-week trial is over, the price will prohibit me grom going as often but i do plan to continue. It's been great for flexibility, relaxation, and clarity, and I've even noticed that it's made me more tolerant of the summer heat! :)
1 I waited 45min past my appointment then payment was demanded before any service I said thanks for wasting my time and walked out. Antiquated policys anf for all I know their service as well
4 I love St. Lukes you have saved my life. After being an inpatient for a week over a week ago, I have also been attending outpatient therapy for over a month now. Very caring staff but like the other reviewer said, if your a vegetarian watch out, there are limited options!
1 They've really been in a steep service decline over the past 18 mos.  McCoy spends his time at ASU.  PA Ian comes in one a day a week.  PA Alice doesn't return calls even when you go there, at the counter, and ask to have her call.  I've had questions about the medication they prescribed for two weeks-crickets chirping.  TIME TO MOVE ON.
5 I have had work done by both Rowena and Rosemarie and both have amazed me with their skill, knowledge and intuitive awareness in their expertise.  Having some basic knowledge of how stress can have an effect on the body, I was further educated during my treatment on just how profound stress can really be on my body holistically. I felt tension in my head, neck and shoulders but after having work done by Rowena and Rosemarie through a process called unwinding I was able to be free from my pain and furthermore I learned how to manage my pain on my own through self treatments in btw visits. I can't thank them enough for showing me how and helping me to understand the interconnected web of Myofascial tissue...the dysfunction of which was causing my flare-ups of pain. Also, for helping me find the source of pain from past trauma both physically and emotionally; not just treating the symptoms but helping me in finding the cause. This work is a healing process and truly amazing!
5 Adjustments for babies?! No way! I had NO IDEA that regular adjustments actually helped babies from getting all types of common illnesses including ear infections!!! That's right, no more antibiotics or ear tubes when your precious one gets those pesky little itchy uncomfortable ear aches. My son is now 3 and still sees Dr. Jake every month.   The staff has always been the friendliest and I've never seen a new face in all the 3 years we've been going. Any workplace that keeps their employees that long is obviously a great place to work and it shows :)
5 This is a review for my nurse practitioner, Courtney. I drive 45 minutes just to see her every two-three months. She's very patient, warm, listens without interruption, and she makes you feel like you can tell her anything. I've never been this excited to go see a primary caregiver. Thank god my husband's insurance covers my visitation here!!! The wait time is approx. 5-30 minutes. Other staffs (CNAs, receptionists) are also amicable & professional. This facility is small, clean and has two TVs & play room for small children in the waiting lounge. It says walk ins are welcome, but I would recommend making an appointment.
2 Horrible experience. After laser vein treatment, I asked for a followup with doctor 3.5 weeks out because another doctor's office of mine (always in Top Docs), who does cosmetics as well, suggested it, stating that the skin looked burned and they didn't seem to feel it was done at the right 'depth,' as every vein was still there or looked worse, with full circulation. When the doctor at Bellagio came in, he said that, because I'm 53 and I heal slow (I usually heal very fast from any cut or bruise) that I need to apply heat and massage to help the vein absorb and that it was all in the fine print last time. The most rude thing he said was "Who is this doctor who told you there's a problem? Is he as skilled as me? Did he own a vein therapy school like I did [which I understand was for a very short time]? I think you should go to him. I don't want you as a patient if you are going to take other doctor's advice." While I was embarrassed and felt apologetic at first, I realized after he left the room, that this probably made the most sense. So, I'm happy to say I'm in the waiting room waiting for a refund. A person's true character is only known when it is tested. I would not recommend Bellagio Vein Clinic for laser. I was satisfied that they did offer a refund.
5 Dr. Julie Wu is great, always has time for you and listens to what you have to say. The staff is awesome, very friendly and competent. Referrals sent right away with no delays.  The appointments are very timely, if you have a 1 o'clock appointment, your seen at 1 o'clock. I have nothing but great things to say about Dr. Wu and her staff. Highly recommended doctor.
3 I'm not sure if all physio-therapy specialists charge as much as $50 for half an hour, but Athlete's Care certainly have a lot of patients sitting outside the wait area every time I visit. The specialists are typically very young, friendly, and engaging.   They play the same video clip over and over again everyday outside in the waiting area. The magazines are not renewed too often. Yes, I've been in the waiting area for way too many times.   My friend's physio therapist has definitely helped him regain his knee strength, but unless you have insurance coverage, the price for physio in my opinion, is too damn high!!
1 If I could give this place no stars I would. This place almost killed me. Yes killed me. I'm a guy that always goes for physicals and know the routine. So when I started going here they do things much different. My last physical with a new doctor here all he did was check me from the waist up, never took my clothes off or even checked for hernia. That's a standard for men since I've been 16 years old. Also they neglected my increasing cholesterol for the last 2 years which led me to have a heart attack last year. Never mentioned taking a statin, just diet and exercise. I do that already, it is genetically high. Their ignorance almost killed me. You and your loved should not go here. Send your enemies here.
5 I have been a patient here for several months now and while I can't say that going to the doctor is ever a pleasant experience I can say that the staff makes it more so then just about any office I have been to.  Very clean, pleasant and helpful staff and conveniently located. I highly recommend
5 My first introduction to Paragon is when I made a phone call to set up an appt..  A very warm and friendly voice answered, her name is Martha.  She set me up with Amanda who was so nice and very helpful in answering all my questions above and beyond. Dominick and Amanda are extremely knowledge in there profession, Highly recommend.
1 Worst home health people in the office and nurses are rude. Run away!!!! They should shut down...
5 After going through multiple trainers trying to find one that was actually normal, I came across speed and strength university website and thought I would give it a try.  It's a very different concept from your typical big box gym or private trainer.  The gym is ran by a former collegiate football player that tailors the workout to athletics such as basketball and football.  The concept is amazingly cheap for what you get which is a custom workout delivered on a monthly basis. You can come as many times as you want for a low monthly fee and can even take the workout w you!  There is never more than 2 or 3 other people working out making it a personal workout without the clutter and just enough attention from the trainers.  Great trainers and great people! I can't say enough and highly recommend giving it a try!!
5 Just completed 8 sessions at Athletica after my primary care physician referred me over for neck/shoulder pain. Instantly felt like the staff cared about my health, and were fully vested in my recovery. Had a thorough evaluation by Sandi and all my treatment with Kim - nothing but positive things to say about them, and the entire office. I was always seen right away (no wait) and although I hope I don't have to, would gladly go back.
1 My appointment was at 1:00 and I did not see a doctor until 2:30 after I had pre booked my appointment. The customer service was completely unsatisfying and unprofessional. I would not recommend going here.
1 Horrible horrible hospital. The admin girls were very nice and emergency staff but once I got upstairs and they put me in a room for overnight they totally forget about you. I was in a lot of pain would ask for my medicine and it was never gave to me. Would call the nurses asked them several times and they would say yes mam we will be there and they would never come to help you. Molly the nurse I believe is Indian told me I don't want to help you because your using foul language. Really???? Sooo I told Molly we'll get the hell out of my room if your not going to help me. I also told Molly she has a 2 star rating on yelp and she looked at me and said she didn't care. I said well you should I also told her she should go home if she doesn't wanna help her patients or doesn't care about them. Haven't ate in over 24 hours they haven't gave me anything to eat. It's the medical surgical floor.
5 Dr.Dave is amazing. My entire family see him weekly. Even my 4 yr old begs to go see him. He is always able to get us in when we need him. I suffer from migraines and whenever I have one I can call and go right it. I totally recommend  him.
1 I have been very ill and when emergency called to get me an appointment they gave me one a week away nothing sooner, when I called I told them their website showed same day or next day appointments. They said sorry busy.I waited till Thursday saw the pa who said they never got records from urologist and could not do a thing,I told her my urologist said my liver enzymes were elevates 10x an i needed liver and blood panel.she said she had to ×it for test reading,started vomiting and she gave me nasaeu med.made me  apt for next wed. All booked up. Urologist called next morn saying she had fixed results which arrowhead couldn't find. Called urologist said relax.took arrowhead 3 tries to find then they said couldn't find. Called back got refaced.arrowhead couldnt find .finally got a call back from pa who said she couldnt do a thing without the scan,I asked just to get the blood paneled done since we knew I needed them.she said i would have to see her on wed. I got angry and asked to talk to the head doc. got his med assistant who said no openings,I told heri have been so sick for 2 1\2 weeks now.can't get out of bed.she promised I would get a callback that night or early next morning.lies never happened.now I am going to have to go back to emergency.they care nothing about their patients
5 I've been a few times now for Physio to fix my knee & IT band issues. The team are fab & really know their stuff. There's a discount for block bookings too & they sell gadgets (Physio bands & spiky massage balls etc) so you can do some self therapy between Physio sessions.
1 Hands-down the worst clinic I've been to. The receptionists are rude and unwelcoming, which wouldn't be a big deal had I actually received any medical help there, but I didn't.   Dr. Nguyen looked like she's almost offended that I was there. She didn't want to hear my symptoms (actually kept cutting me off with stuff like "fine I'll give you antibiotics", like she just wanted me out of there at any cost). I actually asked her why she's being so rude when I'm just asking for a diagnosis, and her response was "I don't have any answers for you".   This clinic verges on being a rip-off. You can go there if you need a doctor's note or something trivial like that, but don't expect any kind of real treatment.
5 Cryotherapy is super cool!  First found out about it via athletes on YouTube. I workout and run regularly and have always had inflammation issues afterwards. Looking to add cryotherapy to my recovery plan each week.   Today's session was awesome. I went the entire 3 minutes on the first time! I did the elliptical to get my blood flowing and had complimentary tea afterwards. Tom was super knowledgeable and friendly.   I highly recommend this place.
1 Wow, this place is awful. You can't get through by phone to save your life, and when you do get through, you get to deal with a crabby little cholla who thinks she's doing you a favor by speaking to you. The doctor I used to see doesn't work there anymore, so she tells me I'll have to wait 2-3 days for an appointment, see a new doctor, then get another referral for the xrays I need. I wish doctors' offices cared about customer service even a tiny bit as much as other businesses have to. I used to love my doctor, but the office staff are just terrible, avoid this place!!!
5 My mother has been in Sante for 14 days now.  We chose Sante' after going to several facilities.  It is first and foremost, an excellent care facility with occupational and physical therapy every day for rehabilitation with a very well equipped gym.  There is speech therapy for cognitive reinforcement.  Group activities help round out the very long recovery days. Additionally, there is a chef that makes meals to order with a menu that varies from day to day and the food is very good. The building, dining room, and client rooms are set up as a very warm and lovely hotel. However....the best part of this facility is certainly the staff!  The staff from administration, nursing, assistants, therapy, chef, hosts, servers,social staff, transportation, and cleaning  ALL have a smile on their faces and GREET you and address ones concerns or questions immediately.  Our family has been so impressed with their apparent concern and attention.  We would name people that have been so great to my mother and to our family but we simply would not know where to start as the entire facility has been more than stellar!  We are so grateful that all of them have taken such great care of our precious mother. L.D. Haley
4 i was referred here by my accident attorney (I was badly rear ended)  Dr. Silver is wonderful, as well as the other male doc, whose name escapes me at the moment.  Mathew, their massage therapist, is so friendly and funny.  He listens to you when yo describe where your most discomfort is, and works with you. The front office girls are generally friendly, but can have difficulty communicating properly with the medical staff quite often.
5 Wonderful work both the chiropractic and especially the cranial facial release (CFR). The modus operendi appears to be generating the highest return in terms of pain reduction and wellness with the least amount of work or effort. Of course, that should not be interpreted as there is very little work done; quite to the contrary (44lb kettlebells, etc.)!  Regarding the CFR, I have had sinusitis for decades and extremely poor airflow through the nose. I have tried just about everything else possible that I am aware of and I do significant amounts of research.  After only the first CFR session it was remarkably better. After three CFR sessions, there was a huge difference. It definitely is not my most enjoyable activity. However, the first session was easily the most difficult and each has gotten progressively easier. Any uncomfortableness lasts only a short time. So for me, really the issue is either just deal with it or continue dealing with horrible sinus issues all the time.  Additionally, I am strongly encouraging all of my family members to get at least 2-3 CFR sessions. It has extremely helped my mother with only two sessions and the three chiropractic treatments have helped her more than any other chiropractor, massage therapist, etc. and that means a lot to mean because she has lots of neck, shoulder and back pain.
1 I signed my friend up 13 days ago. no visit to date.  trying to call now, I've been on hold over 15 minutes.  this is not the way to run a business, especially a health care one.
3 NO - NO - NO  Dr.. Chad Campbell moved to Mesa from PV Family Medicine.  My family loved him.  He was just a rare medical man - so caring.   I assume he is that far away because of a non-compete clause.  Good thing because I would have followed him if it was closer.  NOW what do I do????????  Lucky Mesa people to have him.
1 I went in for stomach issues and was given 5 tests. Without anything else done I was told to stop eating gluten and dairy. I wasn't given a diagnosis and I was assured my insurance, blue cross, covered all of the tests. Today I received a bill for $4,000 dollars for the tests. I am a single mom and only make about $12,000 a year. While I was there even the medical assistant mentioned that the PA had ordered a lot of tests. The note on the bottom of my bill states the labs were "not allowed because there was inadequate documentation in the medical chart to support this level of care." In other words my upset stomach did not require $4,000 worth of tests. Before getting this bill I went to another provider who simply checked my hormone levels and found that I am progesterone deficient and I have a simple cream that has made my life better. I was saving to buy my first home and now and now I can't. I am beyond devastated.
5 I have tried other locations, this one is the best. The front staff is very polite and very helpful coordinating the schedules. My PT was Jennifer Hallquist - she is very professional, extremely knowledgeable and funny, I actually looked forward to my therapy three times a week.  I don't remember the names of the techs, but I worked with quite a few and they were all good. Clearly this clinic is very well managed.
5 Before going to Tim Soder for physical therapy I had gone to another therapy place for 4 months after having bicep and rotator cuff surgery, and my progress was far from where my surgeon and I thought it should be. Three times a week for 4 months, the therapist  had me doing only 5 exercises, stretched my arm, and I was out of there in 30 mins. It was extremely frustrating watching other patients, who were much older than me, doing so many more exercises than I was, and watching their progression each week. My surgeon and I had both agreed that changing therapist would be beneficial, so he had sent me to Soder.  They were able to fit me into their schedule immediately, and after my evaluation, they had me stay, workout, and doing exercises that had not even been introduced to me by the last place. Needless to say, I became extremely emotional realizing that my progress would've been extremely better if not completed if I only had only known about Soder sooner.  I have only been to Soder for 4 sessions so far and EVERYONE, from the physical therapist, the assistant therapists, and massage therapist have ALL equally showed their support each time I've been there, and it has been even more inspirational watching them interact with other patients, and having other patients becoming inspiring to me.  I've been a gym rat since I was 15 yrs old, and now in my 40's, I've been working at one of the busiest pools on the strip for the last 9yrs. eight hours a day, five days a week, which has literally been my workout and kept has me in optimum condition even in my off season, so not being able to work 1/2 my season has taken more of an emotional toll on me than anything else. Everyone their "gets" my mentality and understands how helpless this has made me feel, and without it being said by them, it's an issue  that  is also worked on as a part of my therapy there by each staff member, which makes me incredibly grateful.  Hand to heart, I recommend Soder therapy in an instant!
4 I go to Sumit's because I get a solid 1 hour 20 minute stretch and workout. I do not have the build of a yogi. I'm bulky and husky. But, that's ok. I don't ever feel judged because I can't do the handstand or crazy back-bends that all the talented and flexible ladies can do. You're encouraged to go at your own pace; sitting in child's pose is perfectly acceptable.  I started going because I picked up a Groupon and have continued paying for sessions ever since. I have seen the benefits of the stretching and the heat makes it easier to really loosen up your muscles. It's also a great primer for basic yoga positions.   Remember to bring lots of water because you will need it. I've gone through nearly a gallon during one session before. Really good for detoxing. After each session I walk out feeling great and am looking forward to my next practice.  For the more advanced yoga practitioners - check out the Power Flow. Those classes are a lot more intense.
5 My son is a Junior in high school and tore his ACL, MCL & meniscus. Dr. Trainor & PA Mia Pierro are simply amazing! My son was in for surgery within two weeks, received all the necessary home care + physical therapy. I highly recommend this office for athletes. Our family is grateful for the amazing care of the staff here. We did not have to wait too long to get seen, and we were often able to see Dr. Trainor at the Centennial Hills location. I pray that we won't have to go through this again, but if we need an orthopedic surgeon, I will certainly come back to this office. Again, highly recommended for high school and college athletes who have sports injuries.
5 I have been going to Back Fit for 2 years now and I have never had a bad experience. I did therapy for about a year and use the techniques here and there in my daily life. I have since joined the massage club and hands down Michelle is the best!! I have seen a couple others but Michelle is the only one I choose to see. She knows my knots better than I do and works them out every month. I started full body massage a few months ago and boy do I feel spoiled! With my work out routine, after a full body massage from Michelle I go home relaxed for the rest of the day.   I have had interactions with all of the Drs. and they are all amazing and all have their own techniques. Ive learned that my body will tell me when I need an adjustment and my tense spots are always taken care of. Back Fit is the place to go!
4 My sister saw these infrared wraps on groupon and booked hers so of course being the little seester I had to copy! Was super stoked after I read what these wraps help do...so the wraps are usually 30 a session and you can go every day if you liked! Julie was amazing and very informative and helpful. You are basically wraps in these huge pads over your skin and are laying on a small bed comfortable besides the ton of sweat that is dripping off of you! It was for 50 minutes at of a tempature 85 to 100. It was amazing. Only bought one on groupon to try it out but will definitely be coming back for more. If your workout or don't and want to detox I highly suggest these wraps with Julie!
5 I have been coming here for about 2 years.  They have the greatest staff and a wonderful sense of patient care.     A wide arrange of exercise equipment and personal instructional together with massage and muscle stimulating equipment help provide an overall great therapy session .  I would not keep going if it wasn't for the continued expertise of the staff and the help i get for my injury.
5 I went here and lisa tge rmt was so nice.they went over my chart in detail. She is an awesome therapist.agreat place.good value for money.very welcoming and helpful.
5 I visited Dr. Kuty for 2 weeks when my son was 9-10 weeks old. He had tie revisions and was struggling breastfeeding exclusively, although I had plenty of milk. He was at 40 minutes per feeding, every 2 hours. Dr. Kuty was a supportive and knowledgeable mom and professional. Her home, turned chiropractic studio, was a warm setting that welcomed us. She was great with my son, doing exercises & adjustments that helped him gain strength, didn't show an immediate change in our breastfeeding. But as the weeks after our appointments went on, he did transfer more and more breastmilk at each feeding. The appointments had taught him new stretches and exercises, allowing him to gain the strength needed. By 16 weeks, he had shortened his feedings to 5 minutes and doubled the amount transferred. It was a long journey, with Kuty as a much needed stop along the way. I recommend her support and expertise if you are having similar issues.
5 The staff is very friendly and is always willing to work with you on appointments.  They're very open about scheduling changes.  They're also great with children, who can accompany you to your room.  There are toys and movies available in the waiting room.  It's a very comfortable atmosphere.  I have been receiving adjustments from Dr. Chris Koch and he's been able to reverse many problems I had been having with back, chest, and neck pain from years of working at a computer.  He's also very good about listening and addressing the problems that you notify him of.  I love coming here and getting my adjustments.
5 I first met Dr Dana Forte three years ago at her South Rainbow Practice and have been using her ever since. I can't afford health insurance since I'm self-employed and have a garnishment that claims fifty percent of my income, and yet nobody sent that message to the illnesses that come my way. Thankfully Dr Forte is reasonable, they work as an urgent care, just come in, sign up, get in line. The waiting area is very comfortable, the bathroom is always clean, the kiddie play area is terrific, and I can usually find a place to sit away from all the sickies trying to cough on me. I've been treated by three doctors and they are all fantastic, analytical and competent. In this day and age when no doctors have the intestinal fortitude to go into private practice, let alone start a clinic, I'm a huge fan of Dr. Forte. And Las Vegas is a better place because of her. Please discount the reviews here that offer only one star, these poor souls are not well and are confusing their illness with their recovery experience at
5 Lets face it, this group has been through a lot of changes over the years... Some were good, some well-not so good. What MATTERS is they are listening and doing what is humanly possible to get back on track. I know the staff cares about their patients!  they have heart and are more than willing to help.  Now, It's your choice. But I know they are a good practice. Choose to be apart of it! You won't be disappointed.
5 Been there for a while, always want to write a review about Debbie and Terry. They are a so nice and professional couple. Just tell them your concerns and they will take care of them one by one in a comfortable way.
1 DISAPPOINTING!! --Chronic low-back--  1. I asked before I scheduled an appointment if they were in network at BCBS - Yes 2. Initial appointment was OK although after a couple decades living with a worsening problem, nothing new. 3. Course of action was to go through *TWO* painful spine injection procedures because insurance required it before longer lasting RF procedure. 4. I found out AFTER both procedures were performed that the procedure center is NOT in network and they just moved on forward without informing me.  (My last appointment I ran into a patient who was annoyed with the same thing)  None the less, the two test procedures went well and the 2nd one I got up off the table and had NO PAIN for the first time in over 20 years.  Light at the end of the tunnel, right?   Noooooooooo!!  I was all ready to get the "big" procedure, studied up on it, knew it was going to hurt like the dickens, was aware it was going to be more painful for at least 24 hours and was told most patients hurt more for 24 hours but it can be up to 2 weeks.  Then comes the bad news.  Dr. Wu told me they do the right side one day and then I come back in 2 weeks and they do the left side.  I asked why.  He said he didn't know.  I asked does it make any difference medically and he said "no".  I said "does it take any longer?" and he said it is actually faster... but that I would have to talk to the office manager.  I sat with Valerie (This was before I even know this was all out of network) and she said they always do 2 procedures because they don't get paid for the other side otherwise.  I said that sounds like a coding problem.  She said she would investigate.  I did the same.  What I found out from BCBS is a vertibra is considered an area so if the first part of an area they treat is full reimbursement and the 2nd part of an area they treat is partial. AHA!  Two treatments because they get paid less!  I received a call back from someone Valerie had investigate (Heather?? Cant' remember her name) and she said they did it because it was "medicare standard". I told her I wasn't on medicare and don't know why they would do that.  I also explained to her what I learned from BCBS about reimbursements and that it seemed to me that I have an MD saying there's no medical reason to have 2 treatments and for me it means trying to get transportation 2 days.  2 days off work plus two recovery times, etc.   She wouldn't budge.  When I asked her who made this decision it was "Chief Medical Officer". I asked who that was "Dr. Burkhead"  I asked to speak with him or make and appointment to discuss this issue with him and "he won't talk to you" was the response.  I then asked to schedule an appointment to see Dr. Wu again to discuss alternatives since there was no way I could do two painful procedures and I objected to the time, money and extra pain for their pocketbooks.  I met with Dr. Wu a couple of days ago.  I actually like the guy and he did a great job with the two procedures and even after this mess, I would trust him to do the right thing medically.  Unfortunately, he had been coached.  I got the "medicare" excuse and "this is how we do it" speech.   He could not come up with one medical reason why I had to have two procedures and was definitely annoyed when I pointed out that he took an oath.  he left the room fairly abruptly and I showed myself next door to try and take care of the medical bill.  I ended up talking to the nicest guy in the place.   I was actually there to talk to him about the how "out of network" and to hand over a check I had received from BCBS that they wanted and I started grumbling about the procedure being split in two.  He was confused. I explained they wanted to do right side then left side and he said "we never do it that way.  We always do both sides at the same time"  He seemed genuinely perplexed and asked me a few questions.  One was "how many?" and I said 5 vertebra and he said "Ow, that's a lot and you could be in a lot of pain" and I said I understood, but I would rather be in lot of pain once than a little less twice... I know me... if it hurt I wouldn't be back so want to get it out of the way.  Seriously nicest guy ever and you could tell his true, genuine concern.  Turns out he was head of nursing.  I don't know if he is going to be able to huddle with the docs and talk some sense into them but what I do know is they have no business sense!  Two procedures when they should be done in one is over-billing.  I'll be kind and not use a stronger word.  Medically, two procedures is 2 sedations, double the chance of infection, etc so not a good idea.  Bottom line... I've spent a bundle.  My company is self insured and I'm part owner so it is *ALL* out of pocket in the end.  I'm still in pain and was hoping they would see the light but am losing hope each day I have to live in this never ending pain.  REALLY?  IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH TO DO THE RIGHT THING DOC! Want a better review?  EARN IT.
5 Dr. Steve was my final stop on my hunt to find a chiropractor in the valley. I moved to AZ several years ago and had to try many chiropractors until I finally found the right one!! Dr. Steve has helped to relieve my chronic back and neck pain, and he has also been very educating when it comes to health advice. Dr. Steve and staff are friendly and welcoming and I always enjoy my time there.
1 Don't waste your money. Vitality Medical Wellness in Vegas is a total scam. I walked out of there after four weeks and lost one pound. I got a DNA test that she spent less than twenty minutes going over. When I complained she said "I can't read the book for you." She also said she spent forty minutes with me. Most of that was the other money spent because I was sick. On top of that I stated I don't eat meat and she kept coming back with meat based diet. For a lot of money I got shots that did nothing, was told to exercise, eat better, and us an online app. I could have done all this on my own and saved a lot of money.  They do a lot more talking than listening.  I have to repeat that they just dropped a paleo diet in my hands after telling them I don't eat meat.  They love to take your money and lead you on for about four weeks while you wait for this waste of money genetics test.  Who tells their patient "I can't read the book for you."  Terrible bedside manner and ultimately will give you a one size fits all method of treatment.  The only reason this office gets business is because they sound like they take a very personal touch on the radio show.  Go off the show for one year and see your business plummet.  I doubt she gets word of mouth referrals.
5 I have been a patient at this office for the past 1.5 years. Shari and Gail go above and beyond to meet my needs each time I have called for an appointment I was able to get in within the week, twice I had a next day appointment. I was always called back into the office within minutes of arriving, I've never felt rushed out the door, while discussing my concerns, and all the staff remember me by name.  I recommend this office to anyone looking for a primary care physician or if you simply have a cold.
5 Andrea and Matt give excellent care to their patients. They actually care about your well being and if you're there long enough become family
3 I only see an actual doctor when I have too, like to get a yearly physical. Cause you wait forever!!!! 50min for a physical I scheduled weeks ago!! Absurd! I love the nurse practitioners! Efficient, thoughtful and really listen. And somehow my wait times are never outrageous to see them. Stick with the NPs or PAs
5 I am fairly new to Pilates and it was recommended by my doctor after an accident.  I suffered nerve damage & was unable to walk...I was told I needed physical therapy to completey heal.  PILATES JOE HAS CHANGED MY LIFE!!!!  I looked into several Pilates studios into the Phoenix & Scottsdale area, and luckily found one centrally located.  Pilates Joe is right next to Smart & Final in the Thunderbird Square Center (surrounded by healthy dining such as Fresh Mint & Subway), this establishment has ample parking, which has never been an issue!    Where do I start?!  The instructors are extremely knowledgeable & SUPER FRIENDLY!!!!  No matter what level you are or even a first-timer to Pilates, there is NO intimidation.  The front desk staff will also greet you with a warm welcome, and are willing & able to answer any questions you may have!  Cleanliness is a HUGE factor for me (especially in a fitness environment), and I was pleased to find a well kept studio, the hardwood floors were spotless, and even the restrooms were immaculate!  The studio space is quite large, which was unexpected from the exterior.  I would recommend Pilates Joe to EVERYONE, I mean what do you have to lose??  The first class was free so I thought, "WHY NOT?!".   Yoga is offered as well, and they offer so much variety, I really can't get enough!  Pricing is also reasonable and not outrageous like other Pilates studios that offer fancy equipment.  Pilates Joe has everything I need!  I think that about covers it, but I can go on & on!  Go check it out for yourself!
1 I NEVER take my precious time to write a negative review, until today. Donald is the most unprofessional "Dr." I have ever encountered. Super unprofessional, cocky, and unorganized. I wouldn't allow him to inspect my dog...if he were dying.
5 If you want one on one attention with the physical therapist this is the place.  Big facility to do rehabilitation exercises and the best of all great knowledge from the physical therapist!
1 The  absolute worst care ive ever received, they dont even deserve 1 star. I was so sick this week went in on thurs dr fardowsian barely looked at me. On fri i called and needed meds switched (non narcotics) and they made me waste money to take uber there only to wait 2 and a half hours for dr clark to walk in not even look at me then precribe one thing i told him i cant take and another that  needs to b pre authorized when i asked them to just call in something on my formulary i was told to come in again on monday so now i was sick thurs fri and all weekend cause they wouldnt just call in a med replacement that my ins will cover.i finally went to southwest medical urgent care sunday and i feel better, but still need other med pre auth. From sunset med. Lets see how long it takes them to do this easy task! They r a sham. Never ever go there. Also keep in mind u will call and 8 out of 10 times u will get an automated message that doesnt even take messages, cause nobody answers the phones. I will say that Rosemary is very helpful and will try but dr. Clark just no's her to death. N buffalo location
2 I'm very glad to hear that my review has prompted the masseuse to make some changes in her etiquette.  I'm sure the other reviews were edited to offset my first review.  But as you can see she never addressed my issues ... only said that all her other reviews were filtered.  I still stand by my first review whole heartedly.  Maybe she had a bad day ... I guess all people do.  But, i asked her if she wanted to reschedule ... she said i could, but i would be charged a no show.  Hence, the start of my bad review.  However, her filtered reviews do show very positive feedback which I commend.
2 I am surprised this place has such great reviews. Perhaps because I have a large base to compare it to. I wanted to ask the masseuse if this was her first time ever giving a massage. Sure she was nice, but that isn't my number one concern when I go for a massage.
5 I have been coming to the Mesa location for about a week now and so far I'm liking what procedures are being done. The doctor is Straight forward and kind. Erickah, The office manager is sweet and nice. Cheyenne who does the PT is awesome! So far this is what I was looking for. Thank you!
5 I had a very positive experience with Dr. A. Huang at Platinum. I have never been to a chiropractor before, and didn't quite know what to expect, but it turned out to be surprisingly relaxing, and I looked forward to this 20 min appointments each time they rolled around. I've always had chronic back pain because my past jobs have kept me on my feet, but my back pain has been reduced significantly, and my posture has also improved.  Their website is quite informative, explaining their services and pricing, and they also offer acupuncture, massage, amongst other things. Maybe it could end up being your one stop shop! Platinum also provides direct billing to your insurance companies!
5 I came in after my initial physio through the hospital had ended. I had been recovering from a Broken Femur and from the start the staff was amazing and helpful, and Rana Sunder helped me set my goals and even beat them. Yesterday was my last required day, and knowing that if I ever get hurt, I wont think twice about going to them.
5 I had a great first experience, they were right on time with my appointment.  The waiting room & back room was really nice & clean.  The check out staff was very helpful & friendly!
5 So, I am not a fan of physical therapy. I have had mostly bad experiences where either I have not made progress or been pushed too hard and gotten worse. That was not the case here. I have a great therapist, Stacy who spends a lot of time with me, using many different techniques to help my neck and back. There are a lot of technicians there as well, who are always helping with ice, exercises etc.. You never have to wait if you need assistance with something. As soon as you feel pain they also care and modify what you are doing or stop it altogether. I would recommend this place to anyone needing physical therapy.
1 Zero is more appropraite--anyone expecting help from this clinic is setting yourself up for failure.   I am post op brain surgery and the doctor refused to refill my pain meds because the clinic didn't gather my medical records.  Dr Reimer informed me first visit was only a consultation to see if we were a good match, and he would need to look into my condition more and would consider nerve blocks for my pain "this is not a narcotic clinic." He suggested i enroll into a 3 week long program at the Mayo clinic for pain mgmt where he did his residency.  This appears to me as a possible financially gainful situation for him,  and a push off from the clinic doing any kind of treatment.  I explained Mayo clinic does not take my insurance,  and I'm still engaged in rehabilitative therapies in home health and would not be able to enroll in this program until i complete my rehab--i asked "so what help are you offering me today?" NOTHING but a scam and waste if my time.  Definitely a place not interested in helping patients through pain.
5 Dr. Michael Landers at Highland Creek did a great job adjusting me. I've been to several chiropractors and he is definitely the best.  The fact that he does acupuncture too is a big plus. I'm glad he opened an office in this area!
5 Good central location, easily accessible via public transit. Needed to have an issue looked at, and they were able to accommodate me the same day. Step Up has quite a range of practitioners, including physiotherapists, chiropractors, massage therapists, acupuncturists and naturopaths. Quite handy if your ailment is cross-disciplinary.  The physiotherapist I saw was patient, listened well and explained in detail what was going on, and what I needed to do to resolve my issue. The place is clean, and functional, so if you are looking for a posh spa atmosphere, this isn't for you. The fee structure, however, reflects the fact that you are paying for treatments, not interior designers.
3 I go to this gym because it's closest to me. Broken equipment is one of my biggest day to day issues here. Other than that, I am there to do my workout and leave. When you first sign up, the manager will be very pushy. My cousin tried to sign up here once when I first started going but was turned off by the manager being super aggressive. They text you non-stop when you sign up to be a guest-my sister's experience- and won't talk to you on the phone to discuss pricing..unless you come in to speak with someone. Whenever I go, there seems to be equipment broken, usually the Stairmasters, which btw, is something that is always full even during the slightly busy times. They only have like 5 Stairmasters that fill up way quicker than ellipticals but for some reason they have a ton of ellipticals. I came in a few days ago and all the stairs were taken and there were two people on ellipticals, leaving like 8 more free. I realize that I can just come during a really slow time of day but that's not always an option.   I also use to do the classes but they keep changing how you are able to use those. Before, you could just walk in. Then, you had to get a ticket from the front desk and hand to the instructor. Now, there are these little screens where you sign up for a class and it prints you out a piece of paper to hand to the instructor. This seems like an unnecessary and wasteful change. I used to come to this gym almost everyday but lately I just haven't been feeling it and I go to the one on Nellis. Also, I was at first impressed with this place because there's a daycare, but they don't change your kid if they're in diapers, nor feed them any snacks. Also, they lost my daughters paperwork twice so I had to keep filling out her paperwork and getting her shot records. There's personal information on that paperwork so that really ticked me off and it speaks to the responsibility of people who are supposed to be watching your kid. Needless to say, I cancelled the daycare part of my membership.   The classes and instructors are really great though, and that's why I gave them 3 stars.
5 I called for an appointment and was able to get in the same day, which is fantastic because I have a pretty busy work schedule, and it is hard for me to make appointments in advance! I was highly impressed with the office overall as it was stylish, clean, warm, and inviting. The waiting room made you feel extremely comfortable, as coffee and water, etc. were provided and the office staff were also friendly. As it was my first visit, Dr. Reiss met with me prior to the exam/adjustment and discussed my overall health as well as what was bothering me. I have been to a lot of chiropractors, and I tend to enjoy those that take the time to get to know their patients, the ones that put in the extra effort to relax the muscles (either through massage, or other options) prior to the adjustment. I've been to plenty of doctors that seem to "snap, crackle, pop" and you're done...leaving me feeling completely unsatisfied and disappointed with the 5 minute visit. Dr. Reiss seems to get that there is more to an adjustment, than the actual adjustment itself. I did not feel like I was pressured to come back for another 5-10 required sessions in order to get relief. I tend to go to chiropractors as I need them, and that is exactly the message that was relayed to me. I will definitely be back and believe I have found my go-to chiropractor!
5 Dr. Dom is, hands down, the best care provider I've ever been to for anything. He always knows how to fix or work toward fixing what's wrong with your body. Doing CrossFit and Weightlifting leaves my body with some serious aches and pains, but seeing Dr. Dom every few weeks keeps me feeling good and allows me to function and perform the way I want to.  I started coming here over a year ago when I was experiencing terrible knee pain that prevented me from squatting. No other doctors, PTs, mobility experts, etc were able to help. Working with Dr. Dom since then has gotten me to the point where I don't even have to wear knee wraps or sleeves to work out. My knees are even better than they were before!  As with any other type of care, you have to be diligent to achieve the results you want, but as long as you do what you're prescribed and see the Dr when you're supposed to, they'll have you feeling better than you thought you could.
1 6 months ago, I received bad customer service from this facility; specifically from the Office manager. I decided to give this practice another chance so I called to schedule an appointment and I was denied services because I posted a YELP review of my experience at this office. I was told that they will only schedule me an appointment if I took down my Yelp post. Who is running this facility? Obviously, a manager that does not know how to conduct proper customer service. Instead of starting over and maybe speaking with me at my appointment about our misunderstanding, this manager ordered her staff to deny me services and tried to force me to take down my review. It is apparent that they didn't take any advise from my post 6 months ago when I suggested a re-training course on customer service. I refused to take down my review because it was my opinion of this facility based on the way I was being treated. Hopefully this reaches the CEO of the facility so he or she can see how their employees are treating customers. They are the face a reflection of this company, I would hope they take to this review and get it together.   Sincerely,   Candice Sanders
4 Vorteile: + Nahe zu U-Dobelstrase. + Rezeption und Wartezimmer. + Wasser, kostenlos. =) + Der Dr. Tardel kennt sich schon aus, mit Menschlichkeit und alles was mit uns passieren kann. Hat viel Erfahrung. =)    Nachteile: - Viele Patienten. Lange Wartezeiten. - Erste Stock. Mit eine alte Holz-Treppe. - Öffnungszeiten. Die sind aber mittlerweile besser geworden!
5 I was very surprised, but the office manager actually called me to discuss the issue in my previous review. That discussion led me to update my rating.  Hope to make this my permanent doctor!
1 Went to My Dr. Now and saw Dr. Pragit. She only spent about three minutes in the room with me then made me come back to get test results. Was charged another Co-Pay just for her to hand me a sheet of paper and walk out of the room. Afterwords, I received an e-mail stating that I still owed $10 dollars on a co-pay. Called to pay it and was told I owed another $10 on the visit for test results but I was never notified of this. I will not be returning to any My Dr. Now and if you value your time, money, and health, find a real doctor.
5 This place go's above and beyond... The staff is amazing!!! Super friendly, but most importantly they care and want to help you out .   The Therapist and techs Truly have a passion for what they do .
1 I am shocked over these reviews. I'm going to have to assume its family or something. I was an unfortunate victim of this group of GPs for years. Because of the long list of the things I needed to see Dr. Lyndo for (no longer there) I felt like I couldn't go anywhere else.  I honestly felt trapped.  This is the wonderful help i've gotten. Dr Daveys sat outside the examining room talking on the phone about his upcoming vacation for well over 15 minutes while I listened. It had only been an hour wait getting in to examination room.  The receptionist are the biggest bunch of rude obnoxious.......they have just about done everything but give me the finger.   I can't tell you how many times my insurance company didn't ante up so they will call you up to the front of the waiting area and in front of EVERYONE ask about it and ask quite rudely. Then tell me they "tried" to call  so I deserve being called up to the front of the class. So embarrassing, especially when your sick. They even called me up when my husband (who had a different insurance plan) had not paid. AND told me I couldn't see the DR because of it! Thats after I had waited fifteen minutes already. I have no idea what I was supposed to do. Go beat up his insurance company?  Then there was the time I was prescribed medication that sent me to the ER. Wait no hold on there was the TWO times that medication was prescribed to me that sent me to the ER.  And the time they told my son he had loose joints when in fact he had scoliosis. Where you get loose joints from curvature of the spine is anyone's guess.   And then when Dr. Bauer accused me of being a smoker, when I told her I wasn't. She told me I was lying....because you know thats what I do. Lie to GP's....Its a bit of a sinful delight for me. I always hope it gets me improved care......oh wait.   The long waits where always enjoyable. If I got out of there in less than a hour it would have seemed nothing short of a miracle. You better plan on a lonnnnnng wait. They are making vacation plans after all.   I could go on for days. This place is awful. **AWFUL***  Please, go somewhere, anywhere else.  The homeless guy on the corner would probably give you better care. He'd be cheaper thats for sure!
5 I had the unfortunate opportunity of visiting the ER and ICU at UMC recently. I was pretty worried based on the stories I'd heard about UMC. Well, the stories were all wrong. The ER is a zoo but when it comes to saving lives these people know what they're doing. A special hats off to the ICU team. The RN's and Dr.'s really know their business. They take the business of saving lives very seriously. I will never say anything bad about UMC. Outstanding job!
5 I can't say enough good things about this practice. Dr. Ginsberg is the best doctor I've ever had. He takes time to explain everything that he's doing and why and it gives you a full run down of everything that could be causing the condition.  I recently went in for a C5 neck issue, and he was amazing. Totally figured out what was going on and took the time to set up a plan to help alleviate the pain. If only all family doctors could be this good.  He will be my and my family's Dr. for as long as I live in Arizona.
5 When I first came across Relevation I was drawn to the idea of a different type of workout but admittedly intimidated by the equipment and memories of the one Pilates class I had attended years earlier which was filled with women who were doing things I couldn't imagine being able to do. I never went back to that class, but am so pleased that I gave Relevation a try. After just a month or two of a modest combination of Pilates mat, Reformer (scary looking machines that are actually fun and challenging in all good ways), and TRX, I have noticed a big change in my core strength and flexibility. I love the studio for its small class size and the fact that Jen and David, in addition to being fun, patient, and challenging instructors, both hold PhD degrees in Physical Therapy, which means that when my shoulder "feels off" they can immediately help me make an adjustment to keep my workout on track while keeping everything in good shape. Among the best workouts I've had. Highly recommended.
1 WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!! I'm writing this review at 5pm while still sitting the patient room waiting to be seen by the dr! Horrific office staff. Rude, unwelcoming and I've been sitting here since 3:15 for a 3:30 appt. A 3:30 appt and it's 5:00 and I haven't seen a dr or anyone else. I'M ONLY HERE TO GET MY MRI RESULTS FROM A TEST IVE ALREADY HAD. I will be finding another dr as I don't need to deal with someone who so downright DISRESPECTFUL of my time. I am beyond disgusted. I don't mind waiting but just tell me I have a 5pm appt like why did I come at 3:15 just to hang out???
1 BEWARE! Do not waste your money or time with NASM. Once they take your money, you mean nothing to them. I signed up with NASM, the 16-week guided study program which cost me over $1400. Once I signed up and received my textbook, I noticed a lot of grammatical errors in the book. Also, the customer service is not great at all. In fact, I think they are programmed to say that they all went through the course.   They cram all this information in a textbook and expect you to memorize everything you read in a short amount of time. Also, the coaches/mentors, so they call themselves are not very helpful at all. They are programmed too.   PLEASE PLEASE don't waste your hard earned dollars. Go elsewhere and receive the customer service and quality learning that you deserve. NASM is a total RIPOFF. Trust me!
5 I truly cannot say enough good things about Complete Care Medicine and their stellar medical staff.  I credit Dr. Herrera with saving my father's life when he took my dad's symptoms seriously after he'd been sent home from the hospital after developing a life-threatening neurological condition.  Dr. Herrera's quick and decisive action prevented a tragedy.  I am so grateful for Dr. Herrera.  The PAs at CCM are also wonderful.  I see Trent on a regular basis, and he is kind, caring, and never, ever hurries a patient through an appointment.  The staff are all polite and sweet, and the front office ladies are professional and prompt.  Do you wait sometimes?  Yes, but please, keep in mind that emergent situations can develop at doctor's offices and they might need more time to deal with those problems.  The physicians and PA's at Complete Care Medicine are not only worth waiting for -- they are true lifesavers.
5 I absolutely love and recommend their services to anyone - after a car accident, Chris was amazing in providing physio, acupuncture, and stretching tips that actually helped alleviate my discomfort. The entire team is accommodating and kind, and I have continued to visit regularly for massages. Without a doubt, Shelly provides the best massages I have ever experienced - and I am truly loyal to her!
5 I have been going to this office for about 3 years, My primary provider is Linda Pachuta,. I can not praise this nurse practitioner enough. Its not just a job to her, she truly cares about her patients. She has squeezed me into her schedule with no notice, I know she has given up her lunch hour for patients. .  Staff members at Thunderbird have told me she always goes extra yard...
1 How funny!!!  It says urgent care, but it's really not an urgent care. I'm seriously beginning to dislike Vegas even more than I did already. This whole city is filled with idiots that don't how to properly post or advertise.  I walk in with LOUD music blasting. Not something I want to deal with when I walk in feeling like death.  Can your "clinic" take down urgent care. Not only that but the girl at the front desk (excuse me, came walking up after I arrived standing there in music hell) didn't even offer me any services, or even gave me options. Very confusing and embarrassing walking into a place like that. You feel dumb and you just want to be looked at, because I've been sick for about 2 weeks now. So this was a lovely waste of time. Thank you!!
5 This is a doctor and staff who know what they are doing and care deeply about the welfare of their patients. From the minute I was greeted by Linda Atwood, I knew I was in the right place. Dr Batky is experienced, knowledgable and kind. I received the time I needed from her, and began to feel better shortly after my first appointment. If you are looking for a doctor, I strongly recommend this doctor and office.
1 I'm a chief executive with 4 young kids and time is at a premium - the ideal customer for a service like this. Love the idea of this service but was very disappointed with the customer service. Can't comment on the quality of medical care because it never happened! I submitted a request one evening through their online form where it says "One of our representatives will get back to you within 30 minutes". No call back. The next day, called their direct number for GTA and spoke to a very pleasant representative who informed me that I would have a visit that evening between 5-9 pm. I rushed my day a bit to make sure I was home for 5. At 7:30 pm, another representative called and said the doctor was running late and would be at my home between 10-10:45 pm. Said they'd update if he was going to be any later. No call, no show. The next day, no follow-up call. I gave up and went to a walk-in clinic. Don't waste your time.
1 Former ex bf turned into a oxy and heroin addict because of this dr.  Stay away from him.
1 Worst place in the world to be a patient. They Have zero respect for your time, will make you sit and wait for an hour or more. Receptionists are by far the rudest most unprofessional people I have ever met.  Moved primary care dr. Across the street to allegheny health network. Should have switched long ago, they are so much more professional, friendly and efficient.  I was seen at the time of my appointment, not 45 mins to 1 hour later, even with being a new patient. So I can actually thank dr Carmen and associates for consistently being so horrible, it forced me to find a far better more professional office for my health care
5 Our entire family sees. Dr. Paige Walend and we love her.  Her nurses, Susie and Linda are fantastic and are so responsive.  If we are unable to get In to see Dr. Walend, this practice has many openings with several Physican Assistants that can  accommodate us quickly.  Prescriptions are sent electronically to your pharmacy and I payments are taken at the time of service.  The most important factor for us is the quality of time that the Dr. And. Nurses spend with us.  We always feel listened to, cared for and not rushed through.  You may wait, but you know that they are taking time with someone else and that they will take equal time with you as well.  I never feel like a number, I feel like family with our Dr!
5 I highly recommend this .. i've been to a lot of places and this is the best i've been to.. very clean, friendly owner/staff, informative and professional.. i purchased mine through groupon for $39 , I will definitely come back again.. awesome experience and relaxing. Love it!
5 This clinic is amazing. I've been having a lot of health problems this summer and have been searching far and wide for a good doctor to finally get some help. I'd gone through months of pain and problems until I finally found an excellent doctor, Dr. Degrio here, and am finally getting help and getting my concerns taken seriously. Honor Health seems to be amazing in general. They have never been rude or dismissive like so many other providers in the area.
3 Dr Fakhouri is amazing and the best but the front desk people are rude and incompetent.  They do not know what they are doing. They need to learn about customer service. They are the 1st people we see and they can lose client because of their bad attitude.
5 Vitality medical center is excellent . I had food allergies and was able to pinpoint the problem through testing. Cristy and staff are very helpful . I highly recommend this office.
5 I love this office and the care takers in it as well! I had been coming to this office for a couple years now and have had a chance to see both Dr Matt and Dr Dominic, and both are great! I just recently moved out of state and made sure that I make an appointment to come see them while I was here visiting since I am 6 months pregnant and have bad sciatica, I can tell you I already feel better! I highly recommend this office! I see Dr Dom because personally I like his intensity but Dr Matt is just as great!
5 I ended up in the clinic when I was unable to see my primary doctor.   Dr Bagheri was the doctor I was assigned, I found her to be an excellent doctor, I know because I have a few in my family. She is professional, knowledgeable and takes the time to explain the situation fully. She also will give you the full picture and answered my questions completely.  Great Doctor, and the staff were great too.
5 Dr. Hogan is a great chiropractor! I had headaches from the minute i woke up to the minute I fell asleep for weeks and now I rarely get them anymore! He also helped me with my knee problems & taught me how to role out the knots in my thigh/calfs!
5 This is my third time going through p/t at Foothills Sports Medicine for different focus areas. The first two times, my orthopedic surgeon only allowed me a select few places for therapy or he wouldn't do the surgery - this being one. Great results, great atmosphere, and great staff. Though the staff has changed over the years, everyone operates as a family that gets along. This is my second round of therapy with Tony, and highly recommend him. Appointments are easy to schedule, convenient  location, and they seem to really care about results! Highly recommend.
5 Great doctor and good staff.  She's very attentive and kind. Here's another review I left for her. Just want to make sure it's there and helpful to anyone else:  Dr Sbaih saved my life. When I came to her as a new patient, she sent me for blood work to get started. I got it done on a Saturday and received a call from her at 4am Monday morning to get to the emergency room immediately.  I didn't realize it but I had been in rough shape.  I always appreciated the way she called and had to get a bit strong with me to convince me to go to the ER.   I needed it. I appreciate her and that attentiveness.   My wife, mother-in-law and aunt-in-law all go to Dr Sbaih and all trust her word on our health. Definitely would recommend her to your family.
5 The best physical therapy place ever!!! Super caring, honest, and supportive! If you are looking for a great physical therapy place this is the place to go!! I've been with them for 2 years now for my various issues. There is no other place I'd go. Jason, Debbie, and Robert are amazing. They make sure you leave in no pain!!!
3 The physicians assistant is excellent. However the person who schedules the patient is way over scheduled the doctor and the physicians assistant. It was an hour and a half past my scheduled appointment time before I actually saw the physicians assistant. And then she complained that she hadn't eaten or drinking anything all day and here it was almost 130 in the afternoon. This is not good for the doctors the patience or the staff. But this is what the insurance companies required to make money. Don't forget that it's always about the money. Not the patients  or the doctors and the staff
1 I never want to go to this hospital again. Worst experience ever. I was stuck there for five days and all they did was make up more excuses to keep me there. Did every test imaginable and yet left sick and had to go to another hospital. I told them over and over the antibitocs was making me sick. They ignored me and came to find out I was allergic to it. They also have horrible TV service, wtf? The employees also were nice but they were to open in complaining on how they have budget cuts there. I am a patient, I dont want to hear how cheap they are. lol. The food was the most disgusting food ever, I thought I was eating dog food.  Go to another hospital if you can. This is a horrible one. I cringe just thinking about it.
3 the reviews seem to be all over the place (and for good reason) but DR. THOMMAN KURUVILLA gave me my quality of life back-- and my faith in doctors!  first off i have to state: there are bad apples in every basket/every and anyone can have a bad day. i joined yelp specifically to write this review because this was the first time in my 28 years of life that my immediate well-being and quality of life hinged so closely together on the same sword.  at the end of april of 2014 i had just finished helping my fiance move in with me. on the very last step of the staircase and with the very last box to unpack, i tripped over myself and fell a couple feet warping my right ankle and breaking the fifth metatarsal (long bone of the pinky-toe). that same night i went to spring valley hospital, because what else is one to do, where i was charged ~$3500.00 for 5 super special x-rays on a dvd [that advanced orthopedics ended up just doing their own anyhow], two tablets of hydrocodone, and a pair of crutches... the interim podiatrist that night happened to be dr. sep bady of advanced orthopedics.  the negative reviews on yelp are sadly correct. i didn't have health insurance at the time so i was a cash paying customer-- with that said, i've never been anywhere where someone who pays in cash (and in full at each visit) is treated less than human. IN ANY OTHER setting in american life a cash paying individual is normally treated quicker and better... you'd save a few thousand at a car dealership, you can shop even when credit/debit machines are inoperable, etc. but in the case of this place, i felt embarrassed and judged at every turn. again, even though i never missed a payment, because i paid in full at each visit, the front-desk staff and even doc bady himself made a big deal of reminding me of how difficult cash payment could be.   IN FACT, despite the many posters that adorn the walls of the clinic displaying how all the doctors there (sep bady included) have helped basketball and ufc stars recover in record time... i sat in a cast for two months before my surgery because sep bady didn't believe that i could afford surgery on his terms. his terms being that i subscribe to chantix to help me quit smoking, as well as use stryker implants for my surgery-- CAUSE I'M SURE HE DOESN'T GET MONEY FROM EITHER COMPANY FOR RECOMMENDING THEM TO PATIENTS. so we waited to see if the bone would magically grow back together...  as bady expected, after the two months the fifth metatarsal had not reconstituted. his last words to me were literally, "we wish you the best and good luck." sep bady even recommended i invest in a nice and very expensive hiking boot-- he didn't even believe i could afford the $150 for the orthopedic recovery boot they sold in-clinic. he literally saw me as nothing more than a homeless person on the sidewalk that he probably speeds past in his convertible.  Fortunately for me his nurse was a compassionate human being and referred me to another doctor within the clinic, DR. THOMMAN KURUVILLA, an amazing individual who looks patients in the eye when he speaks to them and asks if they understand what is and will be going on-- since it is their bodies, duh.  for less than half the cost that bady estimated, DR. K offered non-sponsored implants and conducted my surgery just a little ways farther west on durango. he and his surgical team greeted and spoke with me on the day of the operation. back at the clinic, his nurse took great care of me and undid the stitches with ease and humor. maybe i seemed like a hard luck case but he never even charged for follow-up visits; i gave bady $500 for four visits where the x-ray tech did/spoke more to me than him.  THOMMAN KURUVILLA saved my life.  thank you, sir.
1 I would love to give this a zero rating.  I signed up for personal training and they told me that the trainer they assigned me would be available on the days I had free.  Uh, nope.  Then I switched to a different trainer.  She was often late,  or shorted me out of my 30 minutes of training - sometimes five minutes, sometimes fifteen, and the final straw was when she forgot a session with me!  So, I complained to the personal training manager.  He was understanding and kind and said he had to kick me up to a higher manager.  That person said they would cancel the automatic withdrawal for the personal training sessions, but I would probably still have to use any that I'd already paid for.  Okay, no problem.  But, then I realized that the money was still coming out of the account!  I called, no call back.  I stopped by, no manager was available to see me, I called again, left messages, and finally the new manager called me several days after I'd left more messages.  In the meantime, more money is coming out of my account.  Finally nearly three months after I first requested to cancel my account, it is supposedly cancelled but they still took the money and then refunded it - I think.  They assure me it's been refunded but it does not show on my account statement.  When this all started I had five sessions left to use up (at $33 per session!) - and now I have fifteen!!!  They will not refund my money telling me that due to management changes they have no idea what was said, yada yada.  Their customer service is definitely awful.
5 Dr Reddy has been my primary doctor since living here 10+ years. The front desk staff is always polite and informative about the wait (example there is one person then you're next or doctor is running behind and will be a bit past your appt).     The waiting area always like it's busy but there are several doctors and a couple NP's that work out of the same reception area so it's never a long wait like it appears.    In the last few years I've switched to seeing Laurie, Dr Reddy's NP, I can make my appointments sooner with her typically and she is just as knowledgeable and professional as the doctor in my opinion.    It's convenient that I can get blood work on site if necessary and the nurse who draws blood can hit my tiny veins on the first try (something that most hospitals can't even do in my past experiences).
5 I would give her 10 stars if I could..this doctor is very sweet..kind..humanlike..not robotic or nasty like the rest of them these days..A true breath of fresh air!  Shes also very thorough..does not rush you either...I so appreciate..appreciate..appreciate her..all doctors could learn a thing or two from her!   Not to mention the staff at the 1000 N. Rainbow Blvd. Adress is very nice..all of them!  Great service with a smile
5 I left Maple Leaf Medical and moved to Yonge Wellesley Medical Clinic. I had a great first interview experience and am looking forward to my first annual physical next month. To the previous poster complaining about not getting seen to have a blood pressure reading done. Why didn't you just go to Shoppers Drug Mart and use one of their machines?
1 This location of Apex, their main location is a nightmare. The staff is not incredibly rude. The office is a dump and the doctor is very odd.  I could barely bring myself to go their once a month. Then I found the new Bonanza location and it is heaven. The staff are great the doc is just wonderful. I will never go back to the Beardon location
5 After loosing my doctor to a concierge medical service I have been shopping around for a great doctor.  I believe I have found one! Called in for an appointment and was expecting one days away. instead, they scheduled me for the next day!! My appointment was for 8 a.m.  I was expecting to be waiting for a while and to my surprise I was called back just a few minutes after 8 a.m.  The doctor was great and even gave me some tips to get my scripts cheaper! all in all a great visit!    ******NO ONE PAID FOR THIS REVIEW :-)~
5 So here's what is funny to me about the negative reviews.  Folks say they have been going here for YEARS and then say they have a problem.  I call BS on all of it.  Second, any medication of any level of importance/sensitivity requires testing to assess levels in our system and/or to check and see if we're actually taking it (in particular narcotics and ADD/ADHD meds).  My cousin takes Adderrall for his ADHD and he gets a urine drug screen about every third or fourth visit to ensure he is taking it.  It is a highly abused medication by students at any age and in particular college students.  Finally, my wife was seen in less than 15 minutes as a work-in for a bad sinus infection this past winter.  While this was likely an uncommon occurrence, if you don't have an appointment, you should expect to wait.  If you can't, go to an urgent care.  On every one of our appointments, the longest wait was 10-20 minutes.  In a family medical office, it is common to get behind.  Good providers take time to hear us out and ensure our questions are answered.  They are strained by the insurance companies to hold appointments to 15 minutes, so if you're going to lay blame, do so there not with empathetic providers.    Dr. Germaine and Chelsea are amazing and it's why they see our family and will continue to do so.  For the complainers, just keep complaining because that seems to be what you do best.  The laundry list of satisfied patients at this office is there in spite of your keyboard courage.
1 Horrible practice. Does things you don't need done and charges you for it.....  I went for a general assessment and ending up having to pay over $300 and nothing was done.  On top of that. During my visit I told dr. Licata I had been having neck problems. He said do you mind if I try something and popped my neck a couple times. Get my insurance bill and I am charged an additional $55 for an adjustment! Just a poor practice all around. He made me feel very uncomfortable and did not seem like he cared about any of my problems. I def will NOT be back!  Stay away and find a better doctor who actually cares and doesn't want to tack on every additional fee to your visit!
5 So intrigued by this place! My husband got it for as a birthday present and I was excited to try something new! I had just gone for a long run that morning and my float was at 3pm. It says it can help with soreness and recovery and it did. I wasn't the least bit sore the next day or day after which I usually am. The owners sent me an email the next day thanking me. Facilities were super clean, well thought out and I'll definitely try it again for running recovery.
5 So I wrenched my already aching back on Wednesday and by this morning I could barely get my sorry butt out of bed. After a bit of stretching and some electrical stimulation, I felt a little better. I pedaled on over to Clinique Altermed to see my acupuncturist, Annie Duguay, and told her that my lower back on my right side ws giving me some trouble. She took my left hand, stuck in a bunch of needles and the pain disappeared instantly. Twelve hours later, I feel great.
5 Had knee surgery and went here for therapy over a 5 month span. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Carlos, Melanie, and Kaycie were all great therapists. Recovery went according to plan and all the therapists were very knowledgeable when answering any concerns.   Highly recommended!!!
5 My left leg hamstrings were torn off. At only 11 weeks post-op, I'm still in a lot of pain. When you have a serious injury, the last thing you want is to have someone touching it. Right away I could see their staff was professional. My PT did a great job explaining what my injury was and how we were going to move forward to heal. Thank you Spooner PT.
1 It had been a few years since my last medical visit.  I recently moved and needed to find a new Dr.  After several days and many phone calls I chose Dr. Deborah Solomon.  The office staff on the initial visit were great but it went downhill from there.  I needed blood work, which was also a good experience, considering.  I scheduled a follow up visit to go over the results.  It was a very long wait only to have a different medical assistant (Becky) come in yawning and acting like she was on drugs.  I was shocked with her behavior.  The visit with Dr. Solomon was fine and she prescribed me some medications.  One of them after going to the pharmacy required a pre-authorization, which has been a nightmare.  After 6 weeks of notifications from my insurance to this office, nothing had been done.  I finally called insurance to find out what I could and was told the Dr's office was not responding.  I called and left a message and was told they re-submitted the information.  I told them that additional blood work was need with the response of, "Oh yes, your right."  I went to the office to pick up the form to go someplace else for the blood work (20 minute wait to pick up a form).  The blood work was completed within a couple of days and they sent the results to both myself and the Dr.  It is now over 8 weeks and my insurance denied the claim due to the length of time it took my Dr. to take care of the paperwork.  I finally got through to the medical assistant who blamed the Dr.  I asked if she was going to refund all the money I had spent for this - of course not.  If you want to waist your time and money, go to Dr. Deborah Solomon.  The worst medical office I have ever experienced.  Off to find another Dr.
5 I was very pleased with this office. It is a little out there but worth the drive. Plus they had available appointments on the date which never happens. The reception attendants were very kind and understanding as well as the nurse. The doctor was great. He was very knowledgeable and quick. He made sure all of my questions were answered and that I left feeling reassured. The only thing that was a little weird for me was having a second person in the room. The room was small and it doesnt make you very comfortable having a second person checking out your genitals just to hand the doctor his tools that are 1 ft away. I also wished the person I made my appointment with told me where in the office it was. It took me extra time to look it up in their lobby directory and a mistaken office to get it right. Overall pretty good. Easy. Would recommend it.
2 Although they have great prices, the experience was very disappointing. Unfortunately based on the fact they are located in old houses, renovated, they did not consider noise on East Blvd. I tried to relax, but the light from the window, and noise, yet muted, was in my mind. The service was ok, but not the spa feeling/experience I have enjoyed at multiple locations.
3 Ah, this place isn't all that bad.  If you are here, you're probably sick and grumpy.  Keep that in perspective.   This place has been taken over by Health Care Partners which means all new doctors.  And they haven't updated their website so the doctors listed aren't there anymore.  A couple stars off for misinformation.  My suggestion is make an appointment and make it with a nurse practitioner, not a doctor.  Same day appointments are easy to get.  But if you make an appointment with a doctor, even if it is first thing in the morning, it'll take forever.  And if all you need is an opinion about your illness du jour and a prescription for antibiotics, a nurse practitioner will do.  You aren't here for surgery or anything.  The nurse practitioners are super nice but efficient and don't waste time chatting up the staff or clients.  Just get in and out and back into bed.  That's the goal, right?  Speaking of which, that's where I need to be instead of writing Yelp reviews.  Antibiotics haven't fully kicked in yet.
5 The original referral from my Dr was for a facility that was way to far to be going 2 to 3 times a week, I relied on yelp reviews to locate a suitable option closer to home. Glad I did!  Have been going to Blankenship PT for about six weeks for a shoulder injury. Have found the front desk and PT staff to be very helpful and professional. Appointments run on time and the facility is clean. Seeing progress in flexibility and posture.  My overall feeling is that this is an excellent choice should you find yourself in need of Physical Therapy.
4 I took my dad here for a procedure and could not be happier. The building looks fairly new and has a ton of parking. The waiting room is really large and has really nice air conditioning. =)  The staff was really helpful in guiding my father with his insurance questions. They were right on time. Procedure turned out great and the staff was amazing. I hope he doesn't have to go back but if he does need another procedure, we we will definitely choose this place.
5 I've had a nagging hip problem for 7 months. I've tried chiropractic care, massage, and two other physical therapists. The orthopedic surgeon wanted to do surgery. I was referred to Henderson Physical Therapy (Mike) by a friend and decided to give it one last try. Results have been incredible after only 3 weeks. I'm better than I was before! If you're looking for a therapist that knows sports and athletes, Mike is your guy! They take a ton of insurances and the cash price is reasonable.
1 My Family has been going here for about 8 years.  It seems to take longer to get in and lately they don't even answer the phone. We will be changing as soon as we can find another.
3 I went to the ER for unbearable left arm pain that seems to be radiating to my left upper bank and upper chest. I clearly stated it started from the antecubital area and travel to my upper arm for the last couple of days. The pain was spastic in nature that I could rate it 8/10. No chest pain nor short of breath. The pain on the antecubital area wasn't foreign to me, I said. It usually comes with my RLS but resolves once the RLS symptoms subsides. The triage nurse acknowledged these info and to be on the safe side they need to r/o cardiac. Therefore, I was seen as a cardiac r/o patient... Forget about my arm pain. So once my cardiac enzymes, ekg and x-Ray r/o anything cardiac, they are DONE. I was given a lidocaine patch and "muscle relaxant" prescription. I'm giving them 5 stars for taking me quickly but... I wish at least check the nature of the pain of my arm they brought me to their hospital, that's ZERO star.  So, I went to a regular doctor the next day... She can't give me the relief or answer either but at least she listens to the nature of why I am in her clinic. Today, I'll try another ER and hopefully they will be able to give me an answer. If all fails... I'm heading to the airport to Mass General Hospital. I'm starting to believe the saying " where do you go if you get sick in Las Vegas? TO THE AIRPORT!"
5 Bright and clean, professional staff. Couldn't believe how fast I was seen, I'd say I was in and out including paperwork within about 20-25 minutes. The doctor was efficient and friendly and very easy to deal with. I did not feel in any way rushed. Highly recommended.
5 This office is top notch all the way around.  I manage the fitness facility a few doors down from this office and I have had nothing but A+ service from everyone in the office.  It is true that this office does not operate their business on a "come in for a crack, get thrown out the back" business model.    I personally find great value in this both for myself as a patient, and for the members of my gym that I refer to them.  The staff here is very thorough, professional, and personable.  I have no reservations in referring any of our members to this office.  The feedback I have received from our members has been nothing short of positive and complete satisfaction.
1 Keine langen Wartezeiten, nette Menschen.. leider bei akuten Erkrankungen werden immer wieder Pflanzliche mittel verschrieben. Auch sehr oft nicht richtig eingestellte Dosis.. erst nach der zweiwöchigen Krankheit wird gehandelt. Das ist mir schon 3 Mal passiert. Da wir Ärzte in der Familie haben.. wissen wir dass es um Sparsamkeit geht.
5 I don't want to tell anyone about this clinic because I want to keep it a secret for myself.  Hours:  Weekdays 9-5 (Tuesdays 9-7) Saturdays - 9-12  I walked in here on a Saturday at around 1000, I was the only one waiting, I barely sat down before it was my turn and I was out in 15m.  Green P lot on the north side of Hammersmtih and it's only $2 /hr.  They also have a small pharmacy and do blood work here. WTF? How is it not lined up out the door?
1 Completely unprofessional.   I arrived early and waited over 30 minutes for my appointment. After finally being called, I was asked to make a urine sample for my appointment. I went into the bathroom to find several used cups that had not been picked up in quite some time. Dirty.  My physician, Ilona Bleaman, was very nice and welcoming, but seemed to be in a big rush. Not sure if they overbooked or what but I sensed she was in a hurry.  Upon leaving, I was asked when would be best to schedule my follow up appointment. I was super confused as any doctor I have gone to in the past called with results. I asked if it was possible to get the results over the phone and they said no. You have to pay another co-pay to get your results!!! I reluctantly made the appointment but after talking to a lot of friends and family about how they always get their results via phone call, I called and cancelled. I was finally able to get them over the phone after saying that the law gives me the right to my medical results.  In addition, I recently received a bill for my blood tests. One of the five things tested was not covered by my insurance so I called to find out what the test was for. While the lady on the phone was very nice, she told me that she didn't know for sure but from what she could see in the system, I was in for a routine well woman exam and gout. UMMMM...excuse me? Gout? First off, I didn't even know what it was! After she explained it to me, I was utterly confused on why that was even in my file. I never have, and currently do not have any symptoms what so ever of gout.  This place is so unprofessional on a number of levels. Unfortunately, I did not do any further research online about this office and went off a co-workers recommendation. There are terrible reviews all over the internet about this place.
5 My family member recently stayed at Kindred Sahara.  She received excellent care from a group of caring individuals.  I highly recommend this hospital for your loved ones.
5 One of the best places in the valley to get a massage. I highly recommend Kierland Massage club! Justyina is one of the best massage therapists I have ever had in my life. The Staff is helpful and friendly and Dr Scott is wonderful, If you are looking for a great Chrio.
5 I don't let just anyone move bones around, but Dr. Vogel and his staff have earned my trust. The office has a nice, clean and welcome feel to it. Ana is the best office manager around and I'm convinced that Phil is the only physical therapist in the world... everyone else is just imitating. I'm not going to comment on Dr. Vogel's appearance, like Cynthia K., but I will say that he KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING! If your looking for a chiropractor/physical therapist look no further...
1 ZERO STARS.  This is the WORST PLACE EVER.  If you are injured, please do not bother to come here. I was treated so badly here that I also wrote a formal complaint to the office.  I split my elbow open while on vacation in Las Vegas.  I slipped at the pool at one of the resorts and wanted to get the nearest urgent care.  Unfortunately this was the first place we found.   As if I was not in an incredible amount of pain already, because my elbow was gashed open about 2-3 inches, the front desk receptionist made matters even worse.  These people are by far, the RUDEST, most INCONSIDERATE, UN-PROFESSIONAL, and down-right MEAN people I've ever dealt with.  Especially in a place of medical need, where people are already in pain and agony when they arrive, this is the worst treatment you could get when you walk in.    I stood in a line just to even check in, while I held my elbow (dripping and gushing blood) with a wet pool towel holding it.  There was NO SENSE OF URGENCY.  Even though the receptionist could clearly see me holding my elbow that was profusely bleeding with a wet, already bloody pool towel.  I asked her if there was anyway I could see the Dr. right away since I was losing blood quickly and feeling nauseous. Not even a little sympathy. "NO. You'll have to wait your turn" and she handed me a clipboard with papers to fill out.   I looked around the room and no one else in there was in the severity of pain or immediate attention of a doctor.  A couple people with coughs, the lady next to me had a welt on her hand, THAT'S IT.  No one was bleeding or looked in pain.   Long story short. After about 1 hour of waiting (maybe longer). I finally was put into a room to wait for the doctor. I waited another 20 mins for him to arrive. He came in told me I need about 3 stitches, as I had told the receptionist that that is what the EMT's at the hotel had told me.    I was taken to another room to have the stitches done.  Waiting another 30 mins. Finally the same doctor came in, gave me the stitches and told me to wait for the nurse to come back in.  Waited another 45 mins. I sat there, holding my freshly sewn up elbow with a small guaze pad.  All of the bloody utensils, guaze, and towels sat around me, while I waiting for the nurse.  The nurse came in and told me to hold the guaze, and she wrapped tape around the guaze and told me I could finally leave.  I STILL HAD DRIED BLOOD ON MY ARM and laying all around me on dirty and disgusting towels.  She did not clean up my arm by wiping off the blood, left the bloody utensils and towels and walked out.    I was utterly disgusting and so emotionally traumatized (and in a massive amount of pain), that I walked out (with blood still all over my arm) and left.   I can't explain how angry, upset, frustrated I felt at that time. I felt as if I had been taken advantage of and treated in the worst possible way.    PLEASE DO NOT GO HERE.  =(
1 Sorry, but DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE!  I first went on Monday mid-afternoon. After seeing a full lobby I spoke with one of the gals at the front desk. (These are the people we rely on to give us accurate information about the establishment, right? ) I explained that I was in search of a new primary care doctor. I asked about the sign that said 'urgent care' and if my visit would be charged as 'urgent care' or as a primary care visit which was what I was in for. The woman's EXACT words were ' no matter the nature of the visit it is as a primary care visit'. I let her know I didn't have an appointment and asked if that was 'ok'. She said of course it was as she handed me paperwork to fill out. I briefly explained to her the nature of my visit.She reassured me that I would be seen and taken care of as they operate as both a primary care and as an urgent care. I filled out documents, paid my co-pay and patiently waited over 2 1/2 hours. I didn't mind as, I was after all a walk-in. As I was taken to the back the gal did the standard measurements (height, weight, reason for visit) I was VERY CLEAR as to my reason for my visit. She took notes and led me to my room to wait. Let me add, I ALSO called last week to inquire about them being my new primary care doctor as well. So total; I was mislead 3 times!!!  I HOPE you have read this far folks because THIS is where it gets good! Dr. Rago walked in and almost IMMEDIATELY asked me what I was there for and said, "I only treat urgent care patients so if your matter isn't urgent then I cannot see/treat you today."  !!!! WHAT??!?! I was baffled! I tried to maintain my composure as, I definitely wanted to cry not only over for why I was there but that I had NOW WASTED 3 HOURS of my day! I asked him why no one had explained that to me and let him know I was VERY clear when I arrived both that day and the day before when I made my inquiries. Are you ready for his answer folks? He said, "Well, its company policy and no matter how many times I try to explain this to the girls up front they just don't understand.... the few who ACTUALLY do understand I have spent quite an amount of time training but for the most part none of the girls up front get it..."  REALLY?!!?!? THIS IS YOUR ANSWER? I was furious! I am NEVER a mean or cruel person, especially to strangers. I would like to think I was STILL pretty nice to him given that his idiotic staff who evidently cannot understand his 'simple concept' as he made it sounds. I DO hold him accountable as well though, as he made it CLEAR this is A BIG PROBLEM AT THEIR FACILITY!  I immediately asked if I was going to be refunded my co-pay. He hesitated but said that yes and he would have to get the office manager; he asked me to WAIT again!! As nicely as I could, I asked how long as I have my 11-month old daughter at home being watched and I had already spent a sufficient amount of time there only to hear his answer of his staff not grasping his 'simple' concept.  I did not wait long for the office manager. Did she apologize? No! Did she empathize? Hell No! Did she say ONE WORD TO ME? NO! She escorted me upfront where the girl was to give me my refund which.... she was clueless that she was doing so! I asked her about my refund which prompted her to, I assume ask the manager, where she then returned, collected my card, printed a receipt and I was on my way. Did she apologize? NO.  DO NOT GO HERE! Sure, if you need an Urgent Care however, I can think of SEVERAL Urgent Cares which are more deserving of your time and money. Come on Folks! IF the DOCTOR (managing doctor) is aware that this is a COMMON problem / issue; wouldn't you say it's time to close the doors and drill it into their little heads? How dare they take up half of my day to turn me away and take 7-10 days to refund what I so quickly paid based off of their words.  OH I did forget.... THE BEST PART... from the Doctors mouth, 'my P.A's can only do so much and they will NOT be able to help you with what it is your describing you need' WOW! I will go ahead and share one portion of my reason for visit. I have been struggling with  severe depression and nausea from nerves (nerves probably from anxiety) (so his PA's can't handle nausea??) . Let me ALSO explain my primary care doctor of 9+ years was ALWAYS able to assist with this and work to find a resolve ! I have not needed a thing for anxiety/depression in MANY years (not a 'drug seeker' ) as I have learned to meditate though, circumstances prevail! I MISS MY OLD PRIMARY CARE DOC! MOST doctors/P.A.s can get you on the way to finding the right anti-depressant ...SO IN SHORT (LOL) DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY HERE! THEY ARE UNEDUCATED, SMALL MINDED AND EVIDENTLY LIMITED IN THEIR ABILITY TO PRACTICE MEDICINE! LET'S NOT FORGET THEY DON'T EVEN APOLOGIZE FOR MISLEADING AND WASTING YOUR TIME. MENTAL HEALTH IS JUST AS IMPORTANT!
4 Carlo was perfect for me - he explained everything he was doing in easy to understand terms, he didn't do any weird aura cleansing stuff, and he gave me some useful stretches to take away. I will definitively be going back when I need some work done again. Also, he's the nicest guy, ever. As a bonus, his clinic was able to bill my insurance provider while I was there, instead of me paying and submitting later.
1 Don't even bother to go there  The worst costumer service in town  Every stuff the think he have power to speak with u  Like a little shit. Time is never issue there  U always been sees 2 hours after your time
5 This spa is amazing! I really enjoyed the place for the service, the high-quality massage and the beautiful decoration. It's cosy, warm and the staff is lovely! I hightly recommand this place if you're looking for a good massage and relaxation. It's in front of Parc Lafontaine, so you can enjoy the beauty of the parc after a massage!
5 From:Eula Bettis When I knew I was relocating to Las Vegas I looked up primary care physicians. I felt vibes from this doctor has if I knew he would make me better. I looked up PCP 4 months before coming here. I moved then 2 months later I made an appointment and I cancelled twice due to I do not  know how to drive. FINALLY when my husband came we made the Appointment and It was the best decision I have made since relocating From east coast. PCP I had back east did not care as much as Dr. Sharma. Dr. Sharma words were he will make me better. He sits and talks to you. We are happy we found him. Thank you Dr Sharma
5 Awesome service. Fast service . Friendly nurses and they get straight to the point. Lots of bad reviews probably from stressed people.
5 Orthopedic Sports provides excellent Physical Therapy for athletes, weekend warriors, and those of us who are occasionally spacially challenged.  The staff is friendly, professional  and VERY knowledgeable.     I came in with periodic numbness on my left side and worked primarily with Pam.  My symptoms have been resolved, and I have exercises and strategies to use if issues surface again.    I highly recommend them. Don't delay if you have pain!
5 I've been going to Adelaide West on and off for years and been with a few different physiotherapists and a nutritionist. None of them have failed me. Almost always, Kathy is the one to pick up when I call to book an appointment and despite not being a frequent patient, she always remembers me! Some may consider the prices to be a bit steep but it's really a bargain if you consider the amount of care you get and how effective the treatment and exercise prescription are. You won't be stuck unattended with an IFC for half of your session like most physio clinics tend to do.
5 I have never had a doctor (for myself or for my son) who followed up on his patients the way Dr. G does.  At the beginning of summer, my son became really ill- sever stomach pains, diarrhea, vomiting, loss of appetite, dehydration.  Dr. G was there pretty much every step of the way.  While we were at the ER, he emailed me periodically to check the status of my son.  My son recovered 2 weeks later, didn't bother to let Dr. G know that he was well.  It was Dr. G who called me to set up a follow-up appointment.  His partner Dr. Grace (she's my son's original doc but she was on maternity leave at that time) is also awesome.  I'm so glad they accept military insurance. The staff is also so nice and sweet.  Only negative point: the wait to be seen can be long, but I don't mind the wait.
5 The staff is AWESOME!!! I felt comfortable from the first day.  I enjoy myself.  They keep a smile on your face even when you are in pain.
3 Dr Tsai is a nice guy but our medical views unfortunately don't match anymore.
5 So even though my name is listed as Billy Smith my actual name is John Herlihy and its just listed as Billy Smith cuz the only FB I have is to play games with. But I was just told today that there is a post about The Core Institute that was most likely posted by someone I knew just because I was venting about a bill I received and the person I thought it might have been said she didn't post it so I apologize for thinking it was you but I can't seem to find the post because I never post on yelp or anywhere for that matter. But this post claims that Dr. puttlitz billed me wrong and I had to pay around $900 due to somebody else helping him with a procedure. Which I did receive a bill and yes I did vent to a bunch of people about that bill because I have been stressing money since my break up. But like I told everybody when I was venting, that I was waiting to talk to my Dr. When I had my next appt. and I did today then had to download this stupid app to rectify what was said. The Core Institute is a really good place to go if you have any type of injury! Their doctors and pysical therapists are some of the best people I have ever met. And as for the billing issue, like I said today was my appt. and they are on the patients side unlike most insurance companies and they are already working to figure out my issue. So anyone reading this please disregard a post from J.H. where ever it is because it is technically false from what I've heard it said. Plus I will still try to find the poster and have them remove the posting if they're able too.
1 Worst place to go if you are sick. Horrible bedside manner. You can hear their whole conversation at the nurses station in the waiting room. They didn't even know the dosage of medicine for a child. And to top it off one of the employees got in my face and yelled at me when I confronted them about a mistake.
5 My husband just got released after a 2.5  week stay. We are so grateful to the entire staff for his medical care and rehabilitation!!  He had caring and attentive RN's and CNA's and the physical, speech and occupational therapists met with him daily and did a fantastic job!!!  He was examined daily by caring physicians who genuinely cared about his progress.  We highly recommend Desert Canyon!!!
5 After going to a different urgent care and actually getting worse, a friend recommended this one, which is practically next door to me, so score one for location.  Staff is super friendly and professional and there wasn't a long wait at all.  The Doctor was awesome, really spent some time getting to hear what was really going on, making the diagnosis and getting me the treatments I needed.    While I hope I don't need them often, this will now be the ONLY urgent care I go to.
2 I see Dr Bell who I think is a good doctor he listens and doesn't just go by the drug company's pushing drugs, but having said that the office operation is not good. Last year they called me said it was my time for a yearly exam. Went in late after work about 4:30 appointment. The waiting room was nearly empty. They called me in I waited in the exam room for 50 minutes it's 1/4 to 6. The noise in the hallway outside the room is dying down. I come out and ask around find hardly anyone except one person up in the front office. She is very surprised to see me I'm fairly sure they forgot I was even in there. I was getting upset I told her I can't wait around for an hour in a room. She didn't know what to say to me I could tell they knew darn well what happened. They ran around and I told her I was leaving and Dr bell came out said he would take care of me in a few minutes. The exam was about 10 minutes listen to my heart and said sounds okay. He asked me If I need to have a finger up my butt I laughed but was thinking to my self what a strange thing to say to a patent. I told him forget it had to go. I wasted 3 hours it was the last time I went there.
1 Front staff was friendly and outgoing, disappointed I sat around for 45 minutes for my insurance to be verified. After all that time, they were unable to verify it with their corporate office. Not sure I want to go to a place that can't get through to the billing office. Won't be going here, after reading the rest of the 1 star reviews. I think it's a good thing.
5 Dr Duhon is the best guy and orthopedic surgeon I could have prayed for. The dr before him did harm not good and Dr Duhon fixed me up. Still working on right knee but he gets me in when I need him and makes me all better. I couldn't ask for a better doctor for all my needs. Cindy
5 After dealing with a pinched nerve in my neck for a few months. My first visit today he was able to get my neck unlocked and able to move without any pain.    The. techniques that he uses make you very comfortable and you know you can trust him. I am a believer and will be returning.
1 I made one visit to this office with my 4 month old.  It was worse than a visit to the DMV.  I waited close to two hours for my appointment and was given nothing but excuses.  I would highly recommend avoiding this practice.  In addition I needed an extra diaper only to be told they don't have any.
1 Went to see Dr. K 3 times and he is very rude and does not listen to what you have to say at all. He does not care for the patients. I will be seeing someone else. BEWARE DON'T SEE THIS DOCTOR!!!!!! a waste of time. I also waited in the office for over an hour. The nurse took 4 patients that came after me first. You can hear the nurses talking so loud about their personal business. He is the only doctor I seen in the office at the Henderson location. Not a good place to go at all. Very Unprofessional!
4 I have been a patient of Dr. Barbee's for about two years. In my appointments, she has always been professional, thorough, and she takes time to listen to my concerns and preferences in my treatment. Her referrals to specialists have been spot on and she is very helpful in suggesting preventative care.  The annual physical appointments are done in two appointments. The first appointment is a chance to talk about how things have been over the past six months to a year and to alert her to any specific concerns. This allows her to recommend any Bloodwork or tests that need to be done. The second appointment is to review those results and to make suggestions going forward.  I have noticed over the past year or so, that the office is much busier and that it is difficult at times to get an appointment with her. I have experienced long wait times recently. I hope these are just growing pains and that the office will become more efficient again.
4 I've been here a few times, as a patient or accompanying family members.  I can't say anything bad about this hospital, especially if I compare it to some of the US health care places I have been to (cough! expensive and less attentive).  The specialists we've come across are caring, patient, and extremely knowledgeable yet able to explain complex medical situation in concise "normal" language. Love their "patient navigators" who are nurse professionals that guide and help you through whatever tests the doctors have ordered.    I wouldn't wish sickness on me or anyone.  But if I do get sick, it's comforting to be in this place.
5 Met Dr. Chad Stewart after a fall.  While he didn't UHC at the time, there was a very reasonable pay plan that worked well within my budget.  Massage chairs, TENS unit, roller table, 15 min massage and adjustment are all included in the visit price.    The only thing that would make it better if I could have a full hour massage!
5 Ran into an unfortunate knee problem mountain bike riding and the good folks at the DIPT helped me to get my spring back. They have a very knowledgeable and helpful staff who gave me the tools and inspiration to get back to 100%. I would recommend this place to anyone seeking a happy and helpful physical therapy experience. Big thank you to Dave, Ariana, Lindsey, and the whole DIPT Team!
5 I would recommend carofit to anyone I was in a really bad car accident they treated me like I was a human and not a number the staff really cared about was what was going on with me and how I felt alongside being a really great chiropractor and the staff they both have great bedside manner which is important to me after having surgery on my arm I plan to go back again and get physical therapy and also get some work done on my back
1 dont waste 1 minute of your time, and not 1 penney of your $, or your insurance! rude staff, rotating pa's every visit! rude, angry dr., who has no clue why ur there, even tho he asked for u to make the appt to address something! refused to give my meds, refused to follow thru on a referral for me, which was very important. idk why even??? every yr, every month, every week, this office got worse, if that was possible. last visit i knew i'd never be back after yrs there. they finally went to far! i was actually screamed at by dr germaine, and behind my back he called my specialist-tried to get them to give him my records, info, over phone, without my permission! hey now dr!! hippa laws! exactly what my other dr office told him, and he blew a gasket they told me on my nxt visit! questioned his sanity??. be ware! some drs should not have a licence! that's dr germaine!
1 This originally was the Gold's Gym location I went to the most. My mother had I had joined Gold's to work out, trying to improve out health, which has worked so far.    With Golds, we had purchased the 24.95 membership, which got us access to ALL Gold's Locations nationwide, as well as discounts with many retail locations I had interest in, discount through Gold's, Access to all their online stuff, contests, and the ability to bring a 1 guest with us as often as we wished. While all the locations were a long drive for us, a hour round trip, it was worth going.     Suddenly, on 1/7/2015, we received emails saying Gold's here had been sold to EOS, final on the first of the year, a week before this email. It did not tell us a whole lot in the email, and so we had some concerns.  We tried to learn more about this new gym. We went to the gym as told to, because that day the switch over was suppose to start. No. We were told after our hour drive to come back next day. We tried to get more information, but no one would answer our questions that way. Tried to send in a question but was unable to to the site saying it didn't work and to try back later. Next day was no better, and so we requested canceling information, which we were handed a card with a phone number without being asked why we were leaving, or any offer of explanation.    We called, and the EOS representative was no better. I felt like she did not listen to me very well, and I was told due to not having given a months notice before billing, despite only learning about the change the day before, I had to pay the 24.95. At this point, we don't even know if EOS HAS a 24.95 membership, because all that's listed is a 9.95 membership, and no one will answer our questions. So I asked if there was a way to wave the charge. She said she would talk to her manager ( I would have preferred to talk to one myself. For all I know she was filing her nails ), and went off for several minutes before returning and saying if I had called two weeks before the billing date (18th ), that something might have been done, but it was too late.   Wait, so if I had known, say, on the 1st when the sale was final, or even on the 3rd, I could have canceled? If we had been given the same courtesy, this wouldn't have been a issue?  On top of that, she kept telling me "Nothing will change at that location". Have you not listened? I am concerned about the whole thing, not just ONE LOCATION. We bought the package that gave us more than just access to one location. if it were the $10 membership, it would be one thing, but it isn't! What is my $25 getting me? No one would tell me. And somehow, I doubt a new company would keep a gym EXACTLY the same.    Frustrated, and offered no options to help, I told her to cancel it, as did my mother who was in the car with me. With things handled so unprofessionally, we weren't sure we wanted to mess with EOS.    I have since tried to email and send messages to EOS Fitness about me experience, and have received NOTHING back from this company. They commented on a review elsewhere asking for my email, saying they "We would love to assist you and speak to you further regarding your concerns. " . I gave my email, and still have got NOTHING. Yes, EOS seems real eager to speak about my concerns.     I have been given no good reason to stay, and have nothing nice to say about this company. I will continue to improve my health, but not at EOS Fitness.
2 FDGV has gone through some changes with staff, I received a text message about geting an early appointment and responded yes.  Went to the Pecos office and they said I wasn't scheduled.  I am very upset with this new system;  They offered to work me in; the last ime I was worked in, I waited 2 1/2 hours and still didn't see anyone because I left.  The quality of customer service has gone down hill.  The only great staff they have is Joshua and Darryl.  I hope they get it together before they lose another patient.  I have been coming here off and on for eleven years.
5 Dr. Chris just knows where the pain is! He provides a very professional and personable experience. Ive gone to him various times over the past years for everything from car accidents to general discomfort. I am a mechanic and due to the nature of my job regular chiropractic adjustments are a must!
1 I was hoping to be able to provide a more thorough review on the actual therapy.  But the lady who answered the phone could not answer a single question I had and replied to all my questions by saying "OK Perfect".  My son has down syndrome and I have been searching for a place that offers therapy in the evening or on weekends.  I asked the lady several times when therapy is offered and she just repeated their address to me 3 separate times. When I did ask about the second location on Charleston she replied that they had 3 locations. Then a male voice in the background said Charleston was closed.  So I asked her where the other 2 locations are and she gave me the same address for the 4th time for the location on Mesa Verde.  At this point I just hung up.  And I am a patient person because of my son with a disability.  But this lady was just too much..
5 Great doctor I would appreciate if my appointments could be closer or on the same day?  I have had a sore knee for two years now, and it has thrown off my balance. Is there any way to make me comfortable while I waiting like pain medication? Thank you  for your quick resonse by phone.
5 This place is awesome! Everyone is personable,friendly, and professional. I know they really do care about my well-being. I was in pain and they offered different  options to alleviate the pain. I definitely recommend this office and have referred many of my friends and co workers.
5 The employees, therapist and office staff here are super friendly and approachable. They will answer all your questions and if they don't know the answer , they will find out the answer to your question whether it's insurance or treatment . They also keep a very neat and clean facility. I would recommend this treatment facility to anyone needing it's services.
1 When I went to this "group" the first time, I was very happy and would have recommended them and did. Now I wouldn't take my dog there.  I had a good PCP there but she has either left or is on family leave, I was told both so not sure where she went. Then I saw someone to get some re-fills and for a new issue. Not sure what her name was or what she is? PA or NP, who knows because she surely didn't introduce herself or identify her skill level. When she walked in the room she stood about eight feet from me to speak to me and then when she had me on the table she asked me some odd questions.   I learned over a year ago to get paper scripts from them because the electronic scripts never work with my pharmacy, so I got several and went to my pharmacist. The cough syrup she gave me was not covered by my insurance plan and the Gilbert My Dr. Now could have cared less. I went there and they gave me another script. I left and almost to the pharmacy I noticed they hadn't embossed the scripts so they would not fill them, so had to go back for a third time just to get something for my cough. I was treated like it was no big deal that I had to return three times and that I was over reacting to this inconvenience.   I liked the ease of being able to see the same person in what is considered "off" times but they aren't worth the aggravation, the total incompetence and seriously unprofessional behavior. I'd rather take the hit at work (having to go during work hours) than to put up with this company.   oh and I did try to tell the office manager and the main Dr. Zamani before posting on here, but neither returned my phone call.   I'll never waste another minute at this place or any of their places!
5 I am writing this review because I am so thankful for Dr Radoff and the staff at Alternative Medical. Dr Radoff initially began treating our teenage son in 2012, and now provides healthcare for our entire family. I consider myself fairly educated on biomedical and/or alternative medical treatments and with the endless intricacies of treating Autism/ADHD/Asthma/Allergies and so on. There are more modalities available than one can count. To top that off, each and every individual will need a unique set of tools to treat their particular condition. There is no "one size fits all" cure for any these conditions. I completely understand how costly it can be to pay out of pocket while trying one after another until something works. But I can say that with the help and guidance from Dr Radoff we were able to rationally pick and choose our treatments, and thereby saving an incredible amount of time, money and most of all LIFE. Dr Radoff is able to utilize his expertise and experience, the expertise of his impressive network of colleagues, all while remaining open and understanding the importance of parental intuition. With intensive therapies over the prior 2-3 years our teen has changed from severely low functioning autistic (physically, emotionally, mentally low functioning), to a well adjusted young man. His path has changed from needing 24 hour supervision and no real opportunities for an independent life, to being reenrolled in high school, having his first intern job, and will possibly drive and live independently someday. It is a long and difficult journey with no promises for the outcome. But without a doubt worth every second and every dollar, in my opinion. We had consulted with numerous other doctors and been so incredibly disappointed with their lack of knowledge, lack of any desire to obtain knowledge, and overall pessimistic attitude toward the possibilities. Most disappointing were doctors from within the medical insurance community. It is not cost effective for them to treat these children. We knew there was so much that could be done, but needed a medical professional to help guide us through the healing. We are forever indebted to Dr Radoff. Our son has his life back, with more and more potential everyday.  The best words of advise I can offer are, stay open minded, educate yourself, then continue to educate yourself, look for the little improvements because they add up over time, trust your parental intuition and NEVER GIVE UP. Great book to read for parents of Autistics is "Healing the New Childhood Epidemics: Autism, ADHD, Asthma, and Allergies: The Groundbreaking Program for the 4-A Disorders".
5 I was randomly googling a doctor's office in the Goodyear area and found this one. Their office is very clean and nice. Front staff was very friendly as well. They also take walk-in appointments. They were very fast and The Doctor was very nice and took his time with me. I did not feel rushed at all. I will definitely come back!
1 East Valley Family Medical is a joke, the wait time is hours (one time I waited 4 hours after my appointment time to finally be seen by doctor). The doctors are rushed, they don't ask questions, don't listen, don't provide information. They act and groan and scoff like they're pissed they have to do their job. You wait hours to see a doctor and he sees you for 60 seconds. They're not gay friendly (or people friendly period). They don't do any refills over the phone of any kind under any circumstances, if you need a refill you need to make another appointment  AND they just increased their office visit fee from 50 to 65 bucks.   Not happy. Not even a little.
1 Horrible clinic!!! Waited over an hour im going out of town in the morning and they wouldnt refill my prescription since I was a few daysearly even though I have a written prescription from CA saying early release due to work travel. The doctors here would rather have you suffer without your medication for weeks while out of town then simply write it for you.GO to any other quick care than this one!!!!!
2 We just moved here from WA and are looking for a pediatrician/family physician. I was so excited to try this place out based on the great reviews! Unfortunately, I have been trying to call all day (5 different times) and have yet to get through to anyone. Each time I have waited  on the phone for at least 5 minutes waiting for someone to answer. Not even and initial, "Hi, can you please hold?" For that reason alone, I will not be trying this office. I just want to schedule a general 9 month check up for my daughter. But this gives me no confidence that in a pinch I would be able to get through to schedule a visit for a sick or hurt child.
5 I just want to say that this place is worth checking out because they have so much to offer! I highly recommend Complete Health & Wellness!!!  I bought 5sessions of CryoTherapy to reduce inflammations in my muscles but when I arrived at Complete Health & Wellness center, I found out they have a lot more to offer than just a whole body CryoTherapy.   When I walked into Complete Health & Wellness center, I filled out a quick paper form. Then I went into the CryoTherapy room and was explained why I have to take most off my clothing (you go in the chamber with just panty/boxers on with gloves and socks over slippers). It was a cold 2-3minute in the chambers but it went by quickly as a staff member, Steve, explained how the whole body CryoTherapy works (reduces inflammation, improves circulation, and removes toxins which could lead to weight loss). I've done two Cryo sessions so far and am so excited to see how my body will feel by the end of the week when I finish my 5sessions.   Side note: I also tried the other treatments Complete health & Wellness offers. Besides CryoTherapy, the center also offers THOR laser (finds trigger points to release pain-you won't even feel anything besides some warmth from the laser), and NovoTHOR (which is a light bed where you lie down and the red/near-infrared light promotes cell regeneration.   They also have compression boots (it's this thing you put over your legs and air goes in and out to give you a massage), but if you need a full body massage there is an affordable sport masseuse inside the center. The center can also help your body detox through Metagenics (I have not ordered mine yet but you get 20% discount using practitioner/promo code "CHAW.")  ...ETCETERA!!! Complete Health & Wellness offers so much I can't write everything I tried and saw. It is much easier if you went to check it out yourself! (Don't just check this place out over the internet but actually go see the facility and meet the crew. It is very clean and the staff members are very welcoming, super friendly and knowledgeable!)
5 I cannot say enough good things about this clinic! If you are reading this because you are looking for a knowledgeable, skilled, trustworthy and caring healthcare team..look no further.  I HIGHLY recommend AZ Spine Disc & Sport. My only regret is I wish I found them sooner. I have been going here for about 2 months and absolutely love Dr. Christopher and Dr. Stone. I originally started out in a lot of pain and within a few visits I was already feeling a big difference. They have several different treatment options such as; electrical stim, ultrasound therapy, kinesiotape, decompression machines, chiropractic adjustments, the Graston Technique, trigger point injections, exercise machines etc. They have licensed massaged therapists and acupuncturists on-site and they are great at what they do too.  The clinic has Saturday and evening appointments that are convenient and when I was struggling with extreme pain from a pinched nerve they fit me in theur schedule EVERY day until I felt better!  Dr. Stone and Dr. Christopher are both very knowledgeable and empathetic and really take the time to listen to you. I have seen Dr. Rudd and Dr. Kady here as well and they both are very good at what they do.  The front desk and rest of the healthcare team are helpful and friendly. When I first went here, they were up front and clear about what my insurance covered and didn't cover and outlined any possible costs etc.  This clinic has the kind of integrity that all other clinics should strive for.  I completely trust AZ Spine Disc and Sport, feel my comfort and care is genuinely very important to them, and trust any decisions they make regarding my care because it is obvious they want what is best for me.  Don't pass this place up!
5 Dr. Benitez and the staff there were very friendly.  I didn't have a long wait time. I felt very comfortable with him during my exam.
5 Really pleased with SpeakEasy.  Our 4 year old just started OT and I feel very comfortable and confident in the environment and game plan for him.  Easy to get an appointment (after several failed attempts with other therapy practices in town).  Good people here and my son loves Miss Christiana.
5 I have had nothing but positive experiences here. I find that Luis genuinely cared about me and dealt with my injury effectively. The prices here are reasonable and it is clear that he is competent and easy to get along with. I would recommend this clinic with absolutely no hesitation!
1 I started seeing dr Piccione here two years ago. She is a warm, caring physician. If she can't figure out what's going on with me she always knows who to refer me too. The last time I was there I checked in at my appointed time and was left or forgotten in the waiting room for an hour before I called it to their attention. The front office blamed the back office and vice versa. After seeing her I emailed her twice about getting my test results and spoke to her PA. Neither Dr Piccione or her PA ever got back to me. I had to get the results in my own. Thankfully everything was ok. I'm not sure what has happened to this practice but it's gone down significantly
1 Worst place ever.  I can't even get a call back from a Doctor regarding my visit.  When I was there I could hear the workers cursing and swearing out side my room.  Very unprofessional.  Wasted my money and time going.  Never accomplished anything.  Let's hope I am not dying.  What a joke.
1 I met with Dr Shockey today. I just moved back to AZ after 11 yrs and was looking for a new dr. I've never had a dr make me feel so horrible. According to him,  Adderall is a toxic drug. Never mind that I've been on it for 10 yrs and to ME it has been a life saver. He said my dosage  (40mg) is way too much because the standard dose is 10mg (not true). A Dr can have opinions of prescriptions, but Dr Shockey was a complete jerk. A good dr takes the time to talk to a patient before deciding whether a drug may be good for them. He did say he'd consider it if I got records for him (which I had with me) but I couldn't get out of his office fast enough. No thanks!
5 I went in for acupuncture treatments, saw Dr. Foo, oops! I meant Dr. Fern and I only have two words:   IT WORKS!!!  Please see Dr Fern today...I'm sure you'll be a satisfied customer!
2 Front office staff is not always courteous or friendly and they regularly make mistakes without apology. They also talk audibly, and even sometimes about patients behind their backs. Appointments are almost always late. Procedures are not explained well. Felt like a battle with the anesthesiologist to get him to both explain what he's doing and get what i want... Like "wait for the anesthetic to take hold before continuing with shots" ... Hello?? Am i not paying YOU to do this for me? Don't get impatient with me because i request 5 minutes!! The bathrooms are also frequently gross and lacking toilet seat covers. I kind of hate this place. It's not the worst I've ever been but i wouldn't recommend it.
5 I have been routinely going to Global Chiropractic for 2 years now and highly recommend Dr. Steve to anyone that is looking to see a chiropractor. My initial reason for going was major lower back pain, I was hunched over and good barely walk. Dr. Steve did his initial assessment and took X-rays, and gave me my first adjustment. The adjustment almost immediately allowed me to stand straight and walk more normal. Dr. Steve and his staff sat with me and came up with a daily workout plan to get me back to good. Again, this was 2 years ago, I continue to go weekly as the adjustments help me stay aligned and feel great. I now have my entire family (wife/2 young children) see him on a regular basis. My wife is on her feet all day and sees and feels the benefits. Our son had frequent headaches and the adjustments have made the headaches completely go away. Our daughter is a young competitive gymnast and the adjustments keep her aligned and healthy. There is much more to Global Chiropractic than just an adjustment. Go see Dr. Steve and his staff today!! Sincerely- Dan Severson
1 Clearly this office only wants to deal with certain cases and workers comp is NOT one of them. Unfortunately you cannot count on being provided accurate information by the office staff. I needed to get in quickly and we were assured to call at 7:45am on Tuesday morning and they would get me in, no problem. So I dragged myself out of bed early only to be told, no we can't get you because we have 3 physicians out of the office this week and we need to get our existing patients in first. No apology, no acknowledgment that this differed from what we were told on Friday (they were closed Monday), just a we don't care because you aren't a patient here yet. The whole reason we selected them was not only because they were in network for the work comp claim but also because my husband and I both need a general care physician since we just moved to the area. It is really unfortunate that this is how they treat people. If I'd known they were going to do this I would've made an appointment somewhere else but we liked this office, how they did scheduling (it works well for us and our crazy schedules that can't be planned weeks/months in advance) and they had a doctor in office that was included in Phoenix Magazines Best Doctors 2016. Its unfortunate that this is how they treat people trying to get in as a new patient. I will take my business elsewhere because I don't like being lied to and I don't like being treated as an outcast for being a work comp claim or a new patient.
5 We've been going to Phillips Family Practice for quite a few years now and we love them.  Dr. Phillips is kind, caring and takes a genuine interest in you.  Doug, the PA, and Julie, the Nurse Practitioner are the same as well as all the back office staff.  Most of them have been with Dr. Phillips for years and I think that says something.  I've never found the front office girls to be rude, I think they're just young, if you want to get them chatting bring up "True Blood"  Sometimes the wait is a little long but I don't mind because they take as long as they need with you.  The ONLY thing I have an issue with is "Faux News" on the TV in the waiting room - I'm always surprised that my blood pressure isn't higher after having to sit through that!
5 The Guadalupe and McClintock intersection is my favorite area in Valley.  It has Trader Joe's, Changing Hands Bookstore, and Bikram Yoga.  I've been going to Bikram on and off for years.  In 2009 they went through some renovations and now have an amazing heating system.  The instructors are great and the fellow yogis seem really nice.    The weekend 3pm classes are pretty busy so I try to avoid going during those times.  I love the night classes during the week though and always feel amazing after a class.  If you're looking for a place to do yoga you don't need to look any further than Bikram.
5 I've been here for now for two different injuries.  A fractured tibia was the first and now an ankle/foot injury on the other leg which put me back into crutches.  I am a long distance runner and from the education given and supportive, easily followed exercises I have very quickly recovered from both.  The office space is clean and inviting and the therapists (I swear by Marcia) are the best.  I will go no where else and recommend this location for anyone looking to either recover from a serious injury or simply take themselves to the next level.
5 Outstanding!! I have knee issues that other P/T's could not solve, thought I was headed to surgery for sure.  Thanks to Curtis and the other technician's my knee is healing nicely. Knowledgeable, courteous and maybe most importantly, they talk through every step of P/T process with you.  HIGHLY recommend!
5 Great staff.  Very professional and friendly.  Dr. Waltman was a good listener and a very calming doctor.  My husband and I are new to Las Vegas and we got lucky when we made our appointment with Canyon Pointe Health Care.  We will do all of our follow-up health care with this wonderful group.
4 Went to Ballantyne Medical Associates as a new patient this morning, and I must say that I'm very impressed.    I called yesterday afternoon for an appointment and was told that I could see Dr. Jorge at 9:30 am the following morning - nice!  I arrived to the office about 15 minutes early to fill out forms, and then was actually taken to an exam room right at 9:30...it's always nice when you don't have to wait.  Once I was in the exam room, two very personable nurses asked me my medical history and took my blood pressure and pulse.    I didn't have to wait too much longer to see Dr. Jorge, and he was great - a very nice guy, intelligent, and it was evident that he saw me as a person and not just another patient.  The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that when I called for my appointment, I had to ask the receptionist the same question 3 times to get the actual answer.  Would I go back to this practice again?  Most definitely, and I've already recommended the practice to a few friends.
1 Im a registered Er  nurse i developed a stress fracture from running i made an appoitment with Dr Otten. I was placed in exam room someone came into the room and grabbed my leg exactly were i had the pain. I said hi im Bryan and your who?. Oh im Mathew your doctor.He wasnt in the room for 60 seconds and left several mimutes he called me over to his laptop to show me the xray they had taken.Than he told me i needed am mri which i knew i needed.His office scheduled the mri, two weeks later his office called to tell me to schedule the mri with Steinberg which i did. A week later no call from the office with the mri results. Luckly being in the medical field i went to Steinberg and got the mri reading myself, and i had a stress fracture as i thought.The office NEVER DID CALL with the mri results. What great medical care the group provides. Advice find another group for your orhopedic needs. As of this post they have never followed up with me.
5 Best chiropracter my husband and I have ever been to.  We have both seen tremendous results.  You can't find anyone better, I promise!
1 I think my experience with this office is consistent with the other reviews. Dr. Rumman is extremely rude and has a "I'm better than you" attitude. I see a naturopathic doctor as well as a conventional PCP which she found very offensive. She couldn't believe I would ask another doctor for advice and let me know her thoughts.
5 Still going through physical therapy here.  I have to say that Jody , Andy, Dave, Jen all make a very excruciating recovery .. one that is fun and they challenge me to work harder .  Completely professional - and compassionate care.  Stephanie the receptionist/office manager rocks! always very helpful and takes care of all the sticky insurance stuff ...  If you find yourself in need of physical therapy, I guarantee you that this clinic is the best one out there.
5 This was my very first visit here and the first time meeting Dr Purdy. She made me feel very comfortable and it was easy to communicate with her. The wait time was short. The entire staff was VERY pleasant. Overall it was a great experience here.  They just need to update their hours. Website and Office Policies says closed Wed, Sat, Sun. They are closed Fri, Sat, Sun.
1 Walked in to urgent care, not even one patient in this place, talked to some guy who was not in a mood to move his lips ( much more respect at the DMV). Filled out papers, 25 minutes later went inside, another 15 minutes later a ( doctor) walked in, she actually introduce herself.( as doctor....) 1 minute later she misdiagnosed my wife and gave her medicine to ( TRY). $140 visit with medicine to try. 2 days later pain was increasing , my wife called and was told to come back and basically bring $125 with you after we were told by someone up front , "within 2 days if that does not work call us and we will TRY something else. Knowing that she does not have insurance we could not afford another payment, the person she talked to after half hour conversation ordered her to call headquarter and gave her the wrong number which was for billing. After dealing with more rude people from billing we were told to call urgent care again and get the right number because she did not know the correct one for urgent care. Finally decided to go to a real doctor to find out what a joke you and your places are.
5 Great staff here. Therapists are all very talented, you will not be disappointed!  If you're looking for deep tissue, structural maintenance, or some stress relief this is the place to go. Every single therapist is extremely skilled and knowledgable. And the prices are ridiculously fantastic.  Ask about member pricing!
5 Valerie R. Is an awesome tech.  Made my mammogram as quick and as painless as possible.  She's been doing for 32years, wow!
1 Even though I have a high deductible health plan, where I am told specifically NOT to pay upfront for a doctor service, this office DISREGARDS this and asks to pay $80 for a general appointment BEFORE seeing the doctor. Repeated discussions with their staff did not help. I mentioned that I would be close to meet my deductible this year. Anyways, when the claim report came from the insurance company, I was only supposed to pay $10 for the visit. Now, as you can guess in the last 6 weeks I have not got any check back for the extra amount and it is such a pain to get refund back. I have to go back to the office just for this. Be aware of this!
5 Great staff! Doctor and nurse practitioner both were friendly, knowledge and patient. They answered all of my questions and have been very encouraging so far during my weight loss journey.
5 I have been going to Massage Envy for 5 years now. Not sure if I can do without anymore. Crystal is absolutely amazing!  I have tried other therapists, and they were good, but Crystal is the best therapist for me.
3 The good: Staff is friendly.  Doctors and nurses great bedside manner and knowledgeable.   The bad: Really long wait time- I mean really long.   So if you don't mind waiting a couple of hours to see your dr, this is the place for you.
2 As a UofT student, I was thrilled to find out that I could receive free treatment (minus a $60 administrative charge) for back pain that had been haunting me for several years but that I had been too poor to seriously address. The way it works is that you call and make an appointment with a doctor who will them determine the next course of action, whether it's massage, athletic therapy, physical therapy etc., all of which is provided on-site.  To make a very long story short, I ended up seeing three different doctors over the span of about eight months, who gave me different diagnoses and never actually bothered to touch my body to feel WTF was going wrong. I know touch isn't always necessary to determine the source of problems, but in this case I could literally feel my joints moving around in my back and in my knee, but nobody listened. The end result of that approach only ended up making my problems worse.  Under the alternating supervision of those doctors, I was assigned to an athletic therapist, then without warning switched to a different athletic therapist, and then finally switched to a physiotherapist. The athletic therapists (and to a lesser extent the PT) were friendly and competent, but ultimately useless as they were following the doctors' instructions which were based on a fundamentally wrong understanding of the problem. In fact, as I later found out when I finally gave in and went to a private clinic, all the adjustments, massages and rehab exercises they had me doing for those eight months were the exact *opposite* of what I should have been doing: the doctors at the clinic assumed I had some kind of arthritis (even though the blood tests came back negative), and all the stretching and muscle lengthening exercises only exacerbated the actual problem of having two hypermobile joints in my lower back that needed to be strengthened, not relaxed. I believe that if anyone had actually listened to my concerns and bothered to rest their hand on my lower back for just a few seconds I wouldn't have spent eight months essentially sabotaging my recovery. And, I suspect that had I been a varsity athlete I, and my symptoms, would have been taken a lot more seriously and received a different level of care.  I also found the administrative setup there to be needlessly inefficient. For example, during the course of my treatment there I developed tendonitis in my wrists and arms, which to me was pretty clearly caused by some of the rehab exercises they had me do. But, because that's a different part of the body and not what my original complaint was, I had to see yet another doctor to get that taken care of, a doctor who didn't really have any clue about the kind of treatment I was already receiving. Even what goes on at the front desk can be hit or miss; the receptionists are generally pleasant but one time someone scheduled me for an appointment without my knowledge (??), and they rather aggressively tried to charge me for missing it. I'm incredibly neurotic about dates and times and am certain this was an error on their part, but despite my punctuality during every other appointment (2-3 times a week) they refused to give me the benefit of the doubt.  I know other people have had good experiences at the McIntosh clinic and I'm sure it's a great place for dealing with minor sports injuries if you're not a varsity athlete. For more complex problems, though, and if you want to develop a good doctor/therapist-patient relationship in the interest of truly understanding the root of the issue, it might be best to look elsewhere.
1 this clinic is pathetic, the front end desk is incompetent and rude and unhearing; my first doc never gave me a call back to review blood test etc; my second doc? seemed to know nothing about medicine whatsoever and I was in distress with a flare up of an existing medical condition; I would just as soon die on the street as be subject to these pathetic excuses for medical care givers..........give it a WIDE BERTH
5 Had my first body wrap here last night - the staff is absolutely amazing - very attentive and answered  all questions thoroughly - Studio was spotless and peaceful - I am very glad I went and I have already recommended to several people.  Regardless of whatever goal you may have, you definitely walk away with something even if just stress relief.
5 I get a little nervous when I look at reviews for a business, any business, and nothing but severely negative reviews are written within a very short period of time.  That is what I see here for DeRosa Medial.   DeRosa Medical has helped bring sanity back to my life.   I initially went to see them due to low testosterone.  The nurse from my PCP goes to Dr. DeRosa for the pellet implants and has had no issues with them.  I did not get the pellets because I could not afford the out of pocket cost.  Instead, I used the cream.  They were very attentive to my levels.  I went for blood tests about every 6-weeks to confirm my levels were where they were supposed to be.  I would get calls from them telling me they needed me to get the tests and to not delay any longer when life would get busy.   As part of the initial evaluation, getting an ultrasound of your thyroid is standard procedure.  It was during this scan they found a growth.  It was very small and the medical profession tells people to take a "wait and see" attitude towards thyroid growths.    My PCP and I went forward with a find needle aspiration.  Turned out to be cancerous.   When I got the call from Dr. DeRosa's office telling me they wanted to see me immediately, specifically the next morning, I knew it was cancerous.   The entire office was so kind during this appointment.    After that I was handed off to a surgeon for a total thyroidectomy and then to several Endocrinologists.   Two and a half years of hell, post op, my thyroid levels were still not within range.  Not to mention I was sleeping 18-hours a day, having major brain fog, among other issues.  The Endo refused to run any other blood level tests separate from the thyroid levels to address these additional issues.   I decided to return to Dr. DeRosa's office.  With one visit, Jennifer ran six different blood levels test.  Out of the six, I was deficient in five.  She put me on the proper meds and things are better.  I have seen three different PA's at her office and all of them have treated me exactly the same.  The same professional attitude, attention to detail, they listen to patient complaints and take them seriously and then work to get to the bottom of the issues.   They are my GO-TO medical office.   I will confirm they had billing issues, but I was credited back for my over payments.
5 I highly recommend Step Up to anyone looking for an effective, professional chiropractor- specifically Karen Ngo.  The positives: -Clear, demonstrated expertise of personnel (my neck pain went away within a few sessions) -Direct billing -Clean facilities -Downtown central location -Easy to use booking website  -Flexible hours, this place is open on weekends too! -Email reminders for appointments  The negatives: -None
2 I went to his location today after being sick for two days. Turned out to have Phenomena. My only negative experience is with the front staff. They seemed impressionable and not empathetic towards sick patients coming though the front door. No warm polite greetings. While waiting to be seen in the lobby I could hear them laughing and carrying on like two high school girls. They were talking about getting new chairs to sit on.  Urgent Care Extra, your front counter employees leave allot to be desired at this location.
1 We were referred to Sparks Family Medicine for their practice as they specialize in natural healing while also being able to practice traditionally. We made a 9:00am appointment for my husband and was told to make sure to arrive 15 minutes early for paperwork.  Understanding that doctors are busy and my husband also has a busy schedule with meetings all day, he arrived early and had already had all the paperwork filled out at home prior to going. Like most doctors offices here in Las Vegas, same routine and then the wait started.  There was no other patient in the waiting area and two more showed up after my husband arrived. He waiting almost TWO HOURS and NEVER saw the doctor.  No one bothered to come in and explain or apologize for the delay. My husband sat and started moving meetings around while he waited and waited.  In the end, my husband ended up leaving, telling the front desk that he was leaving after waiting hours and frustrated that there was not even an explanation or ever seeing the doctor.  Their response was, "oh, okay."  Still no apology, NOTHING. Days went by and no one from the offices called to check on what happened, NO COMMUNICATION!!! After several days, I phoned the offices to inquire about getting our co-pay refunded. Giving them money always comes first! We will now wait to see when billing will get back to us.  Things happen, that's understandable, but to have those kinds of business ethics along with a total lack of communication is totally unacceptable.  Unfortunately, they just don't care.  Do yourself a favor and find someplace else.
1 The wait here to see the doctor is very long and if you want to see a specific Dr they get mad. Dr maduka has a poor bedside manner
1 I wish I can give this place 0 stars. The worst clinic I've ever been to. So unprofessional and unorganized. I came to get my blood work done early May. The doctor told me to come back next week so when I went out to the reception desk to book an appointment they said they can only book an appointment one week in advance (I wanted to come back 8 days later due to my schedule). Ok, fine. So I called and tried booking and appointment AND at the same time as them to retrieve my blood work from last year from Life Labs so we can use it for comparison. A few issues here: - The doctor was off that week (then why did he tell me to come back a week later?) - I can't see any other doctor in the clinic to see my results - I called the clinic three times within a two week period to see if they were able to retrieve my last year's blood work from Life Labs (I didn't want to make a second appointment to come in if they weren't able to retrieve my blood work from last year) - the receptionist told me they don't have that information because they weren't allowed to have access to patient information at the front desk. So I told them to have the doctor call me when he's in to confirm - no one ever called me. It was the most frustrating experience trying to talk to people at the front desk.  It is now June 28th - almost 2 months after I first went to the clinic, and I JUST RECEIVED A CALL BACK TODAY. WOW. TWO MONTHS.  I will never come back here even if I was in excruciating pain and this was the only clinic left on the planet.  Also, my boyfriend went to see them earlier - he had an appointment with them yesterday and the receptionist forgot to put his booking is so he had to go home and come back again today. WOW.
1 Don't waste your time. They drain every penny possible through insurance claims. TIME IS MONEY...and they want all they can get. A practice that always makes you wait has selfish intentions. They are typically maximizing revenue, over-booking multiple appointments to allow for some "no-shows," "walk-ups" and are even encouraging extended patient visits and un-planned procedures because it will increase the day's revenue. Basically:  More Patients + More Procedures = More Practice and Personal Revenue  I moved to Tempe about a year ago and My Dr Now was a convenient doctors office I established myself with.  I recently looked into my insurance claim history and saw the most OUTRAGEOUS prices for a routine visit (normally running about $120 at any other physician in my history) the stated reason under the claim was  "additional office services"...WHAT?! ..  One of the days that seemed unbelievably overpriced I will never forget;  I was sat in the waiting room and after 20 minutes I opend the door and ask a passing nurse if my doctor had forgotten about me. She said no and that he would be right in.  Not exaggerating, I waited 11 more minutes staring at the boring blue wall trying to convince myself that some kind of emergency had to have happened.  After a total of 40 minutes in the room I came out one more time and it was then I was told that he had just come back from lunch...LUNCH. I was at a loss for words & the nurse couldn't have cared less. Whatever, I got my 4 minute routine doctor visit over with and moved on with my day.  After finding out the obscene prices my insurance claims have paid for details stating "additional office serviceS" I had to blow this whistle.   I am absolutely livid at My Dr Now and its conniving practices.
1 I was admitted to ICU for DKA and sepsis.  I stayed in the ED for approximately 30 hours and received excellent care.  Unfortunately, I was then transferred to ICU.  ICU was a different experience.  I explained to both the MD and the RNs that I am anaphylactic to the rubber stoppers on medication vials and therefore could only take Levemir and Novolog insulins.  Unfortunately, I was told by both the nurses and the MDs that this wasn't possible.  Humalog was prescribed.  When I asked for premedication or medication change it was denied.  The nurses chose to chart "patient refused" vs following up with MD for medication I could use.  Home prescription was the Humalog.  This behavior jeopardized my life by giving me the choice of DKA or anaphylaxis.  I survived only by standing up for myself and fortunately by body was able to adjust even without the needed medications.
5 I come here for chiro and massage sessions and both have been extremely helpful for me. All staff is professional and passionate about their work, not to mention very patient and friendly with treatment seekers. Definitely a major thumbs up for how clean the clinic is! Its website has a very user friendly e-booking system. Reception also has direct billing available if you don't want to process those claims afterwards. Step Up is about a 2 minute walk from St. Andrew stations, so you have no excuse of not going! If you go on the weekend, don't forget you will have to ring the bell located on left of the entrance door and go up to the 2nd floor.  I rate this clinic 5 out of 5 for professionalism, staff friendliness, clinic cleanliness, ease of appointment bookings, and convenience in terms of clinic location.
4 This facility is clean. They have tv for kids. Lobby is open space. The receptionist are nice. You need your ID and Insurance card and cash/debit card. The wait time is not long. The staff was good in treating me
5 Scott's massage was the best "real" massage I have ever had it may initially be painfull but it paid off!!!!  Scott Rebik
3 I scheduled an appointment and drove down to find a sign on the door that they're closed due to system problems and for everyone to call the next day to reschedule. So they had my phone number and couldn't call me to let me know so that I could avoid wasting my time driving down to their location. The same person that typed that sign could have easily called everyone scheduled for that day to let them know. Incredibly unprofessional.   Seriously, would have taken all of a minute to call me to cancel.  I feel sorry for everyone else that took time from work to drive down there to have to read a sign. No excuse and this is one location I'll avoid like the plague.
1 I didn't get to see the Dr. because I ended up leaving after 90min.   After 45 min, I poked my head out because the light went off in the room I was in and was in the dark.  No one checked on me, bothered to say that they're running behind, that they'll be with me soon, nothing. They didn't seem busy.  There was 1 person in the waiting room when I was there.  I'll wrap it up.Reception can make or break your business.  I took 3 hrs off for this appt. I looked forward to it for 3weeks. I was 30min early, which they emphasized that I needed to be. Cash pay client that wants Prp injections. It does seem that the reception is the complaint in common on Yelp.
5 I had a life changing event that occur that required me to relocate to the Phoenix area. I was running low on my prescriptions and I didn't have any health insurance. I called MY DR NOW and found that their cash pay patient prices was very affordable. I made an appointment for the next day.  When I arrived the clinician at the front desk was very friendly and helpful. I filled out a little paperwork and was escorted to an exam room in no time. The Dr. meet with me and we went over my health history and current issues. He was very interested in my wellbeing. MY DR NOW was able to send an electronic prescription to my preferred pharmacy and I was able to pick up my prescriptions the next day.  Hopefully I will not need to see a Dr. again anytime soon. But if I do I know where I can go to get excellent and affordable care.
1 Avoid this office at all things possible. The staff Jessica and Trisha have horrible people skills. Sara Daly is a terrible PA. I am not sure how Midwestern let her pass through the program. I went in and DOUBLE CHECKED that I was going to do three titers but I only got results for one. I called to find out that they never did the other two. Instead of waiving a fee and having me come back in for the inconveniences for the two additional tests, I was told I need to drive over and pick up an order to go to a Sonoran Quest or make another appointment with the office and still be charged a fee for a MISTAKE THEY MADE! They kept telling me they have no record of anything and basically kept accusing me of lying. It is unbelievable because  I came there fifteen  minutes prior to my  appointment and I was not  seen  until 25 minutes after the scheduled time. I was there for more  than an hour and fifteen minutes. I will be switching medical offices. DO NOT GO HERE.
2 I'm a little behind submitting a review for this office. I've been on the search for a good PCP since my old Doc relocated to the Northwest. I've been in on two occasions to see PA Max Smith and I have to say I really liked him personally. The office staff however is one of the worst I've dealt with. Almost impossible to get through to someone when you call, to get a return call, or get any information at all. They had test results for over a week without calling me (claimed they called but I think that's total BS.)  I had to follow up ... and follow up... and follow up... and in the end - it was just more frustration than it was worth. I will go someplace else.
1 Working in Healthcare and knowing intimately how office hours and surgery scheduling works... This is one of the least organized physician groups I've seen (that says a lot in Vegas).  They schedule procedures and office hours during the same blocks of time and leave patients sitting and waiting with no information.  A clear lack of respect for the clients time.  This is a regular practice with this group and their staff.
5 I have been going here for over ten years. Dr Mike is my general doctor. I have come here for anything from the flu to neck pain, to something caught in my ear. He can help or refer you to whom ever will help.  He is very friendly and professional. Very knowledgeable  as well. His nurse Lisa is the best!
5 They have a friendly, professional staff.  I can get in when I need to.  She is very helpful.  Dr. Harter honestly listens to you and tries lots of different therapies if one doesn't work.  I've never had to wait very long.  If I need to get in quickly it's never been a problem.
1 I have to tell you how disappointed I was with my two appointments this week. First on Monday I said I wanted the $25.00 new patient appointment. I got xrays and a torture treatment of some contraption that slams into portions of my back and neck which left me still in pain. Then yesterday I went in expecting something and I was sat down and explained my insurance deductible to me and that I need to come in three times a week at $125.00 a POP. OK who has THAT kind of money? One time a week sure, but three times?!?!?  Forget it! I was expecting some printed exercises I could do at my home, NOPE! I cancelled all my appts and won't be back. All I got was a fist in my back yesterday for $125.00!!!!  I had to park in the South 40, stayed there over an hour and am in more pain today than I've been in my life. Nope don't call me. I won't be back! Oh yeah and the kicker was they wanted to do extensive blood work on me!~  My MD just did that last week!  Sounds like I would be paying for someone's second or third house.
5 I have had massages from several therapists all over the country but when I was introduced to Patricia over 6 years, I knew I'd found the best!  Patricia has helped my body work through the physical strain of both my pregnancies, not to mention the everyday pressures and on-going physical ailments from past car accidents.  She not only understands my bodies muscular and skeletal structure, she understands the emotional impact on my body.  I do, without hesitation, recommend Patricia!
5 I went to go see Dr. Frank Nhan for a recurring shoulder injury from lifting weights. Dr. Nhan located the source of my injury and showed me various exercises that can strengthen my shoulders at the clinic's large, designated fitness area. He was very patient and knowledgeable as he critiqued my form. Thankfully, Dr. Nhan's home exercise routine fixed my shoulder completely, but if I ever needed to see a specialist for injury again, I'd definitely go to Cloud Care!
5 I recently made the switch to HonorHealth, after too many bad experiences with my other primary physician. I am very pleased with my decision. HonorHealth is a clean and well taken care of environment. Everyone who works here is very friendly, welcoming, and helpful. They can even get me in for appointments the same day that I call. I met with Heather Holleran, and she is amazing! She really takes the time to get to know and understand her patients.
5 Seriously, they have best staff ever. So friendly, courteous, respectful, and helpful. They go out of there way to make sure you have the best treatment possible. I have worked with all 3 of their woman's wellness physical therapists. They are all super pleasant, friendly, and fun to talk to. It's like you are making friends while going to physical therapy. I hope I don't need therapy again but if I do, this is where I'm going to go. It was hard to find a physical therapist that offered woman's wellness therapy but I'm glad I did my research and found the best one out there. Highly recommended.
5 Dr. Boothe is awesome! We just moved here from Vegas and were looking for a new ART guy when we happened on Procare. I just had a baby and was dealing with some posture issues as well. I had immediate relief from pregnancy related issues. What is great about Dr. Boothe is that he's given me exercises that will eventually improve the root problems.
5 My Back was so tight and painful I could not sleep for over one hour at a time before waking up from the pain. I went to a Chiropractor years ago, however though maybe a Sports Massage first would help. Jim works with the UNLV Swim Team, The Rugby Championship Tour recently held in Las Vegas, the Professional Bull Riders and many more. His many massage techniques were custom tailored to my problem. It was Incredible and after the first visit I felt my back relaxing from the stress I put on it. He has made a huge difference on my back and saved me from expensive Doctor visits. There is a Hot Tub available to warm you up prior to your massage.  Note: It you're looking for a spiffy lobby, Silk Robes, Juice Bar, etc.. this is not for you. If you are wanting a legitimate Great Massage at a reasonable price - This is the Best !
5 I love this office.  I saw  Dr. George personally before I had my son.  After my son was born, I returned to have him care for him.  It is not like other pediatric offices, because they see people off all ages, but they do have some children's books.     My son has seen both Dr. George and Dr. Parker and I feel they really care about my son.  They are usually super cautious, and as a first time mom, I like that!  They are very smart.   Unlike other reviews, my wait time has never been long, but I always try to get first in the morning or first after lunch.  I also like that they can draw labs on site.    I think they are worth checking out!  You should always find a doctor that fits your personality and who you feel comfortable with, and they fit that for me!
5 Love this place. They are so wonderful with all the children that come in. Also I have a hard time with my neck and are very helpful with what I need done. I also have a lot of back problems and they work at my pace. We had a problem with the traction with my neck and they offered to do manual traction every time which was wonderful. Doria who does the massage therapy understands people with fibromyalgia and is absolutely amazing. I also have to bring my daughter with me a lot who is 1yr and they are all just wonderful with her. They give her toys and play with her. My daughter just loves Doria. I would definitely recommend this place. This is the only physical therapy place that I have actually liked and have been to a few.
4 Rub-a-dub-dub, one man on a massage table. Wait, what?  First timer! Girlfriend got this for me as a Valentine's Day gift so we could enjoy a couples massage.   As instructed we arrived several minutes before the appointment so I could fill out all the required medical forms. We were met by our therapists right around our appointment time and walked to the house next door.   I was hoping to have my lower back worked on, but she asked if I had any areas of concern and I stated my lower back. She completely stayed away from my lower back - so I guess her question meant what areas should she not touch... duly noted! First timer error!  All in all it was an incredible experience. Professional, respectful therapists help make it worthwhile. I did not feel out of place, at all! Wow. I will definitely go back.
5 Whenever I'm in Vegas, I always stop by to see Dr. Bosch for a tune up and training tips. He is truly a hidden gem in a sea of physical therapy offices that just focus on quantity over quality. His attention to detail and care for his clients is definitely worth the time and money. I can't say enough about how much of a difference he has made in my life. Thanks doc!
1 First time mom became a patient back in Feb 2012 when my son was born. Front desk staff and a couple nurses are rude and short with you. Doctors were nice when we dealt with them and didn't have to long of a wait. However back in Jan 2013 my son was really ill; throwing up and diarrhea. I took him in two days after symptoms didn't get better and they told me it would pass (Dr Vu). Must have called the after hours nurses line upwards of 4 times in the 4 days he was VERY SICK to which the on call doctors (I think I spoke to each doctor) kept telling me it would pass. Took him to the ER because he was so dehydrated and turns out he had a strain of Rotavirus!!!! Which he has shots for but I guess the shots only cover a certain strain. He was admitted to the hospital for three days. I couldn't believe it. No follow up call from the pediatricians office at all except they did keep resending the same $40 bill to collect on a co pay (for the appointment where they told me it was 'pass").   My son now goes to a new doctor.  Thank goodness I didn't listen to the doctors.
5 So far so good! Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. Had both lower and upper back pain that wouldn't go away. Felt like a cramp in my upper back and lower back was a mess. My wife found this place. They have a deal for $20, they do a consultation and xrays. Found out both my back and neck has issues. Lost 70% of the curve in my neck. Going though physical therapy with them and it's been great so far. Back pain is almost gone, less then 2 weeks. I'll keep you updated but so far so good!  Update: almost 12 months later. Back pain is gone. Neck is improving. I am on a maintenance schedule. Really nice group of people that care about their clients.
5 I had a pain in my shoulder and elbow that lasted for several months.  Humza diagnosed my issues and prescribed a regime of exercises and physio therapy visits.  After two weeks, I feel almost back to normal.  I highly recommend Humza and Step-up.
1 Front office staff is RUDE RUDE RUDE! No thank you! I will have my doctor send me elsewhere. Worse customer service I have ever experienced. The staff used to be very pleasant when it was Matt Smith PT. One star is even way too generous!
5 Dr. Adamany and his PA, Brad are excellent!  They took such good care of my father in an emergency situation.  I think Dr. Adamany probably saved his life.  He is skilled, caring, and takes the time to ensure that the whole patient is doing well...not just the knee.  I have worked with hundreds of physicians.  He is one of the top physicians with whom I have encountered.  Highly recommend!
1 I have used this urgent care before for ear or sinus infections and they were good. My visit yesterday may have turned my opinion of this place for good.........  I was diagnosed with bronchitis earlier this year.   Ive been feeling better but still have a continual dry cough.  I've been having raspy breaths, burning in my lungs while breathing, and coughing up chunks the last couple days.  So I was in the area on a fri afternoon and figured I should get this looked at.  I didn't have my insurance card on me (i had switched insurance plans since last visit), Any way the lady at the desk was very condescending about having to call the insurance company to try to figure out my info even though I had offered to pay cash.    I was about to walk out when I was called back. The tech who took my BP was very nice.  She asked me what was wrong when she took my BP and it was 2x my normal pressure.  I let her know my check in experience, she looked surprised and apologized.  The guy who walked in and introduced himself to me as Dr. T....  after I got my prescriptions I found out is actually a PA.  Any way he walks in introduces himself to me and starts lecturing me that I do not have bronchitis, I just don't take care of my asthma and it has spiraled out of control.....  Not once did he ask me any questions to why I thought i had bronchitis.  He then asked me why I'm shaking my head to his comments.  I proceed to tell him, "You havent asked me to enplane my reasoning, you haven't listened to my lungs you have just lectured me about a condition I do not have."  He basically says fine, take a breath as he puts stethoscope near not on against my chest, switches sides again not pressing scope against me. then takes one on my back and pressed it close enough to hear something because he just says wait here and walks out.  The tech who took my BP walks in a few min later and hands me 3 scripts, one for cough syrup, one for steroids (all I really wanted), and one for an antibiotic that if he read my chart he would see is completely useless on me.  It was then suggested that I write a complaint to this email address (she points to it on my paper work.) Hands me my paperwork, which told me how to handle my BRONCHITIS!  Not again!!!!
5 I know how hard it is to be a patient.  And they give you true Physical Therapy Results!
1 Please if you can help it don't send your family members there.Very short staffed at night. Nurses act like you are bothering them. My mom waited an hour half for cna to change her diaper.  Also I have gone body her two different times and her call light does not work. She fell out of bed today. I am not a fan at all.
1 Writing this review on behalf of my daughter who has been thoroughly mistreated by this incompetent clinic. They lost her lab results and had no record of her urinalysis, and proceeded to condescend to her when she called for her results. As if losing her specimen wasn't bad enough, she's now being told she needs to come in for blood tests and that it was on her original paperwork - as if SHE should have been the one to insist on a full blood workup. After being disconnected and passed around to staff, I looked up the reviews to see if this kind of treatment was specific to her, but it appears to be commonplace. Why is this clinic still in business?! Something needs to be done, and I will be contacting the insurance company, the Joint Commission and the EPC to lodge official complaints. With this level of unprofessionalism, there's no mystery as to why this country is in a health care crisis.
5 First time there, dr Laura weidenfeld was great. She was extremely thorough. Cared how my child was feeling and tried to put him at ease. All my boys are going to her.  The office staff were friendly and fast. I was first time patient and got in before I finished filling out paperwork. We usually have to wait an hour or more.  We were back in the room in 15-20 minutes.
5 Dr. Riley has been my doc for 6 or 7 years now.  When I first went to his office, I was confused.  There weren't a ton of people in the waiting room.  I didn't have to wait one hour in the waiting room and another hour in the room.  As soon as Dr. Riley walked in, I started my "speed-recitation of current symptoms" - (this because my previous MD actually would look at his watch and note the time - and then do it again at the end of the "consult") - Dr. Riley listened calmly.  I was confused again, when he didn't just tell me I could pick up my prescription at the counter on my way out.  He actually TALKED with me.  He asked questions.  He didn't make a mad dash for the door!  Miraculous!!  And the good news is that this has not changed in all these years.  I don't have insurance, so Dr. Riley works with me on that.  He and his wife, the staff, everyone is great in this little gem of an office.  Dr. Riley is a real FAMILY doctor - he is always there for you.  What more could you possibly ask for?
5 I recently had to choose a new internal medicine physician because my doctor left her practice. I made the switch over the phone and was given a link to log on and fill out the new patient forms online, which added to the ease of the transition. My appointment was Nov. 19th in the morning. The entire process once I checked in was easy and the staff very welcoming.  I didn't have to wait long before I was taken back for my vitals and the medical assistant entered my diagnoses and medications into the computer database. I waited probably 10 minutes for my new doctor to come in and see me. His name is Dr. Chander. He is thorough and has a great bedside manner. I feel fortunate to have found him via my insurance companies website.  Check-out was simple and I was given the option to take a survey upon my check-out. Dr. Chander suggested I go to the second floor and meet with the chiropractor for an evaluation. I was escorted up and asked if I could return after lunch by the helpful staff. I returned after lunch and my consult was with a staff member and then with the chiropractor. He is very good, friendly, thorough and efficient. He worked on my back, then gave me feedback. I then had physical therapy and massage therapy. The entire staff is wonderful in the chiropractor, physical therapy and massage department. I felt so much better after I was done. I will be returning for more adjustments. I feel very well cared for here and highly recommend them for anyone looking for a good group of physician's and medical staff.
1 I have been a patient here after finding them through my PEBP network. I used to have Dr. Conger who I enjoyed going to however she no longer is covered under state insurance so they switched me over to Dr. Merutka. I have NEVER in my life met a more careless doctor then him. When I switched over he had the nerve to start questioning me like I was a child regarding completely irrelevant things. He saw I gained weight and sat me down for questioning saying " Can you tell me what high cholesterol is?" After the fact that I had stated my impeccable eating habits. The second time I went I just needed a refill for a prescription and they put me down as having to have an appt. I went in saw him for less then 5 minutes and my insurance was charge 179.00. Recently my prescription was on an every 3 month refill and I found out my pharmacy could not get confirmation of refill so I spent 2 weeks trying to contact someone over there and no one would call me back. I finally received a call back 2 days after my refill was supposed to be done with his assistant saying Dr. Merutka cannot do the refill because it says you were gaining weight so you went off the prescription. The last time I was there he refilled my prescription so they seem to be very unorganized. I had to rush to call my Obgyn to rush a refill on a prescription because his office dropped the ball. Luckily for me my women's specialty care doctor is amazing and is able to assist me in this matter! I am now in search of a new primary care physician as I do not pay for money for bad service no matter what it is. I would not recommend using this office for a PCP.
5 Tracy Karas and the Physical Therapy Crew at Triad are great.  I injured my knee and shoulder in a fall 7 months ago.  I went to physical therapy at another location for three months.  6 weeks ago I got a new prescription for physical therapy and decided to try Triad.  Wow - that was a great move.  The difference is night and day.  They listen to me and provide excellent quality service.  And most importantly, I am feeling better.  Thank you Tracy and Triad for a great job.
5 I love this Chiropractic!  Very good doctors, and receptionist are always wonderful.   I think the lady that handles insurance verification might need some help, she looks like she has a lot to do - but really - These guys are great!!!   I am going to obtain a new insurance to see these wonderful people again - they really do care for you.
2 This place could use some doctors who care about patients.   The front is pretty efficient and setup to make you feel comfortable. Plenty of free parking and some refreshment offerings. The wait time is your average hour or so. So if you are in a hurry, don't drop by here.  I came here for a concern I had and the nurse cared more about my health than the doctor. When the doctor finally came, he looked tired, disinterested and told me I should buy over the counter medications for my problem. I voiced that the over the counter is ineffective and in my case makes it worse. He told me im the only person who has ever said that and everyone else has no problems. I told him I'm a unique case and I know what does and doesn't work. Finally he prescribed me medicine that is effective for my problem but only one refill of it.  Currently I'm told that there is no charge but I will wait a few weeks to see if that's true. On one other occasion they sent me a bill later saying I owed money and it was late so I needed to pay a late fee.  Basically, find yourself a primary physician doctor or make an appointment with another doctor. This visit was a waste of my time and primarily because of the doctor. I know it's a business but seriously, try to look like you care about your patients or find a new profession...  I only gave this a 2 because of the office staff and I got the prescription I came for.
5 Came in today for my scheduled laser and Ali, my laser technician did a great job again in taking care of me. She never fails to greet her customers and remind me of the do's and dont's after my treatment. She is so pleasant. By far the best customer service I have ever had! Thank you Ali!
1 My actual massage therapist was amazing. Unfortunately the front office neglected to communicate to me that they don't have a billing code for massage in order to properly bill my insurance.   Initially when I went to the front desk to check out the receptionist told me it would be $60. I asked if they had checked my insurance benefits because I knew I was covered for massage as long as it was at a chiropractic office. She took my card and came back literally seconds later telling me I don't have massage coverage. I asked if she had called my insurance company and she looked away but indicated that yes, she had called my insurance company. I was a bit surprised that she got through so quickly but I thought it would be best to double-check since I have used my massage benefits before on this plan. I called my insurance company myself and waited on hold for the usual time which was about 10 to 15 minutes. I spoke to someone in claims who explained that yes, I do have massage benefits-- just as I thought. She said that the chiropractic office where I had been treated was covered under my plan, they simply had to have a billing code to bill for massage therapy.   I went back to the front desk and asked for the billing code in order to verify it with the representative at my insurance company who was willing to wait on hold. That is when the front desk explained that they don't actually have a billing code unless I was seen by one of their chiropractors. I felt really misled that the person who told me she called my insurance was likely not telling the truth that she had called my insurance company. That was pretty disappointing and unnecessary.  I expressed that I wished that I would have been told that I needed to see the chiropractor for them to have a billing code in order to run it through my insurance. She said that when we spoke on the phone she "assumed I knew" and that "nobody really has insurance benefits for massage anyway".   It's funny, but they explained it so well after I have received the service and was on the hook for the $60. Nobody really seemed to be bothered by the fact a little bit more communication before the service was rendered could have avoided this whole awkward situation. I would have actually been seen by the chiropractor and then they would have been able to bill for both services. Both services would have been covered by insurance.   They lost an opportunity to provide a new patient with two different services, while I lost an opportunity to use my insurance benefits.  Sadly, I won't go back to see the awesome and talented massage therapist that treated the tension from my whiplash.
5 The wait times are way longer than I expected. Kind of defeats the purpose of an appointment when you are waiting for almost two hours. Maybe they shouldn't book so many appointments in one day and it might help. I just had my appointment yesterday for the first time and everyone in the lobby was complaining about the wait times and from the looks of other reviews from years ago I don't think its getting any better and I too was a little irritated initially...   But with that being said, I still give them 5 stars because Dr. Adams and her staff are so great and down to earth and this truly is an amazing place! Lets be honest, sometimes the doctor visits can be uncomfortable and in my opinion its rare to find a doctor who is very pleasant, cares and genuine like Dr. Adams and that alone will keep me coming back regardless of the long wait times. Just expect to be there at least 2-3 hours and plan accordingly - its worth it! :)
1 Think again. I know how abusive she is with her staff because my friend worked for her. No breaks and no food or water allowed unless you sneak it or she gets mad. In fact she gets mad over so many things that you never know what you might do that is angering to her. It's hot in there and if you say anything she gets mad. Being a patient is one thing, but if this is who she really is, I wouldn't go there. I was told they have a standing ad on Craig's list because they quit so often.
5 Metro Movement has been like a second home to me for the past year. It's a fantastic studio with top-notch teachers who are all working in the industry. Not only are the classes some of the best in the city, the teachers are amazing people and very welcoming, and Phil and Kalie who run the studio are just fabulous. No matter what level or style of dance you want to do, they have a class for you. However, I especially recommend it if you are a part of the musical theatre/entertainment industry. It's a great place to build your skills and to network. I highly highly recommend it!!
1 My first appt was cancelled because the therapist called out. I was rescheduled with Candice who was extremely rude. She did not conversate or welcome me at all. She did not smile and was very stiff and rushed everywhere. She acted as though I was a nuisance and asked very loudly and rudely "Is that toe fungus?!" I told her I do not have toe fungus. I've been seeing a podiatrist regularly who recently had to cut my toenails off after I injured them during a hike. The massage itself was very good, but I was treated horribly. I'll just stay with Hand and Stone where I normally go. After the massage I waited by my door for water but Candice was nowhere in sight. I overheard her telling another therapist about me using a Groupon and the other girl said "a groupon???" as if it were a disgusting thing to do, then turned the corner and saw me. Candice did not ask how I felt or if I wanted to schedule another appointment. She did not even look at me but was sitting in the front chair ready to charge me. She abruptly asked "have you paid?" She's lucky I even tipped her $10. She didn't deserve a dime. I will never be back and will make sure to spread the word to my friends and family not to come here. Everyone was very rude, even the receptionist who checked me in.
2 Das Restaurant liegt neben dem Heilbad.Die Einrichtung ist rustikal. Die Tische sind mit Tischdecke und die Dekoration darauf künstlich(Blumen).In dem Restaurant war es ruhig. Die Gäste waren eher älter ab 40 Jahren.Für Kinder gab es nichts zur Beschäftigung. Kein Hochstuhl wurde angeboten,trotz das er vorhanden war. Der Service war sehr schlecht.Die Speisekarte wurde am vorbeigehen auf den Tisch gelegt und nur eine Karte trotz 2 Erwachsenen Personen. Nach den Getränken wurde erst nach sehr langer Zeit gefragt.Am Nebentisch mussten die Gäste 10 minuten warten bis Sie bezahlen konnten,obwohl insgesamt nur 3 Tische in dem Restaurant belegt waren.In der Speisekarte stand Wellnessessen. Das war im nachhinein ein Essen wie bei der Kantine.Die Karte sah vielversprechend aus. Nicht alle Speisen auf der Karte waren Vorhanden.Mein Mann bestellte laut Tagesmenüe Schweinefilet mit Champions und Spätzle,bekam alles auser die Pilze. Als wir nach den Pilzen fragten, sagte man uns, Sie hätten keine.Das Filet bestand fast nur aus fett und die Portion war sehr gering.Die Sosse und die Spätzle schmeckten sehr nach Fertiggerrichte. Die Gulaschsuppe davor möchte ich behaupten war auch ein Fertigprodukt.Die anderen beiden Essen der Kinder einmal Hähnchenbrustfilet paniert und Schweineschnitzel paniert schmeckten auch sehr nach Fertigprodukt.Die Bedienung verwechselte trotz Fragen wem welches Essen gehört diese 2 Menües.Wir bezahlten für das Hähnchenfilet mehr wie in der Karte stand und beschwerten uns.Daraufhin sagten Sie, sie hätten kein Hähnchen.Sie hätten Pute gekocht und das kostet mehr.In der Karte wäre kein Hähnchen angeboten.Was ich per Karte wiederlegen konnte.Aber die Rechnung Veränderten Sie nicht.Man sah dem Service an das der Beruf Ihnen nicht Spass machte.Getränke waren ok. Das Verhältnis des Preises zu Qualität war mangelhaft. Im Grossen und Ganzem eine Katastrophe. überhaupt nicht Empfehlenswert.Wir waren nur einmal dort Essen und nie wieder.
1 Two months later and it's still not resolved. I've filed a complaint with the state about this practice.
4 I like the doctors office as I've had a bad doctor facility in the past.   My main issue is with Dr. Mainsfields's assistant  She doesn't leave a voicemail sometimes. I check my phone regularly and see no messages. When I call back in the second time to get a follow up on what's going on. She responds with another voicemail saying that she left a voicemail already which you did not. This has happened twice now. On top of that she has a rude tone in the voicemails as if I'm disturbing her by calling. Which I don't do every day I wait a few days until I hear something. (Again this is the nurse assistant not the doctor but I don't understand why she's so rude in tone over the phone.) I just won't call in again.
5 Blue Skye's Massage Clinic is where I go when I am looking for answers.  I am pushing the big 5-0 and try to keep in good shape, but my body wants to age faster than my brain.  Davonna is always available to answer questions, provide strategies, and give the best massage for sore muscles.  I respect her opinion because of her years of experience in sports medicine and the various positions she has held over the years.  Blue Skye's can help you feel rejuvenated.
5 I had a great experience. I looked at reviews online and decided to take a chance. The scheduling lady was great in the morning, the staff when I got there was great, and Dr. Tosca was fantastic. I think I was an easy patient though. But, who knows? I called as soon as they opened, and I was able to get an appointment about an hour later.  I will continue to use this doctor as my PCP. He was really nice.
4 Waiting room is nicely decorated like if I was visiting my friend's for afternoon tea. Went in for a check up... I did not have to wait too long so that was great.
1 This is the worse place I have ever been. They took me back to a room after about a half hour, then I sit there another hour before seeing the quack of a doctor. I was puking and not feeling well with a fever.... not something you want to wait around for. When the doctor came in he said that he "Thought" I might have a stomach bug.... DUH!!!! He then said that he didn't think I would benefit from any meds. WHAT!!!! I needed something to help me stop puking, and an IV would have been nice, but they wouldn't do either. So what did I spend my money on again? Oh yea, someone to tell me that he "Thought I had a stomach bug and no prescriptions or anything to help with it. NEVER AGAIN WILL I GO BACK!
1 The office is beautiful.  Dr. Purdy was nice.  Everyone seemed friendly.  But I've been terribly frustrated with the office.  First I couldn't get anyone to answer the phone to make an appointment.  I left messages twice and no one from the Cheyenne office called me back.  Finally called their other office in order to make the appointment.  Then they forgot to do a lab test that was clearly ordered and I needed before surgery.  I had to make a special trip to the office, but got a call later that day saying I had not been in.  When I told them I had, they did not know where the specimen went.  I've also had problems with billing.  One bill showed I owed $300 for a date when I was not in the office.  Now they say I have a past due bill of $59 for a visit 3 months ago.  I have paid my bill every month and just paid nearly $250.  How can this be?  I will definitely be looking for another physician.
5 I've seen Dr. Shirley Rodriguez & Amy Bryan, APRN, and both are AMAZING. The facility is clean & easily accessible, and the administrative staff is friendly & professional. They have a Quest Diagnostics inside that also has great lab techs, Georgina & Jessie. Both Dr. Rodriguez & Ms. Bryan are incredibly thorough, knowledgeable, and personable. They have upbeat & friendly personalities, and because this location is still expanding & adding providers, they have very accommodating availability. Even if you can't see your PCP, they try to get you in with an equally awesome provider. I absolutely love & recommend Dignity Health.
1 I never post negative reviews. If I have a bad experience, I just don't go back. This experience was so awful I need to let everyone and hopefully the staff know so that they can drastically improve.   Please don't go here.   The first visit was fine, very efficient. I  got a routine physical and bloodwork. The nurse (also the receptionist?) couldn't get my blood because she "didn't have the right needle". So I was sent to Sonora Quest and told (by the nurse and confirmed by my insurance) that insurance would still cover everything since it was a routine procedure. So I made another appointment, fasted again, and took more time out of my day to go to Sonora Quest. They were great, got blood in no time.   Problem 1: Inconvenienced  I went back about a week later to do a well woman check up with labwork. These are not fun and generally pretty uncomfortable. The doctor was again efficient and quick but I felt very much like a number and not like a person and it was pretty physically painful. Whatever, I need to get all my check ups.   Problem 2: Felt quite dehumanized   I waited about a week and then called the doctor. The nurse told me I was already contacted about my bloodwork. I told her I was not, that was why I was calling now. She told me I needed to make another appointment to come in to discuss results. Fine. She made me an appointment. I then asked about why I was being charged for my bloodwork. She told me to call my insurance. I called the insurance, they told me that someone at the doctor office had put the claim in as "diagnostic" instead of "routine" and that I needed to call my doctor. I called her again, she told me it was Sonora Quest I needed to speak to. I am extremely frustrated at this point, especially since my insurance told me exactly what happened and asked me to specifically call back the doctor.   Problem 3: Unhelpful, almost hostile staff  Went back for my scheduled follow-up to discuss bloodwork results. When I checked in, the same nurse who I had been dealing with for all of this time, and who made me the appointment, asked me if I had an appointment. I told her yes. She said she didn't have me down for an appointment, she said they had been busy. I asked her if it would be a long wait. She said no.   I waited about 30 minutes after my scheduled appointment to discuss my bloodwork with the doctor. She was fine. She went to leave and I asked her about the results from the labwork at my well woman check up. She left to find out. I waited another 10 minutes. She came back and told me someone lost the labwork and asked me to come back in 3 months so they can do it again.   Problem 4: Are. You. Kidding me. I am never going back here again.  I feel extremely violated, inconvenienced, and helpless. I am extremely upset by my experience. I'm sure everyone there is a nice human but they are running this clinic like other people are just numbers and they are also seriously messing up very sensitive issues.   I now have to  1. Call Sonora Quest to make sure this clinic fixed the problem with the claim 2. Call my insurance to make sure Sonora Quest fixed the claim 3. Make another appointment with another clinic to get another uncomfortable, painful well woman check up  Please do what I should have done and asked around for REAL references from people you trust. This was an awful experience that I now have to continue to fix AND spend money on through absolutely no fault of my own.
1 This place is the reason why Yelp should offer zero stars. Dr Vojvodic is extremely unprofessional. She didn't return my phone calls when I had issues with my prescription to treat my pneumonia (I had a temperature of 104, but Doc V couldn't be bothered), she wouldn't return my calls when I tried to schedule a follow up chest X-ray (her "expert" recommendation) and, when I tried to schedule an appointment with a different doctor in that office for treatment on a terrible ear infection, I was notified that I couldn't see anyone else because "Dr V was my primary care giver."  What a joke! Dr V is so inept, the only way she can retain patients is through this silly policy.   She also took me off blood pressure medicine because it was lower while I had pneumonia. I "real" Dr recently put me back on it. Do your health a favor, go to anyone but her.
4 So, I have been in this facility for about two weeks. Although there was one episode with a nurse on my second day, I have to say I have been treated well.  The nurses are wonderful. Always on time with the meds and helping with everything and anything. One wonderful nurse stood out amongst the others. Her name is Irene. She made my stay here seem tolerable since in reality one always wants to be home. Cindy,Ching, and last but not least, Kk are all wonderful nurses.  The CNA's here are also very good to me. Elsa, Justin, and last but not least Wes. Excellent not only by physically helping me but also by talking to me and reassuring me.  Lastly, the physical therapists are exceptional!!! Mike, Jamie, and Jeff. They didn't let me give up!!! This facility and the people in it treated me beyond well and never made me feel like a burden. I recommend this place to any of you that need rehab.
1 Worst experience. Had horrible unbearable chest pain. Horrid cough. They made me I had no right to be there. Said lungs sound good sent me away. Didn't care about pain. No xray, nothing. It's Friday so I may end up at a different er tomorrow. I need care.
3 Staff are great , very friendly. However Dr. Delgado doesn't seem to care and seems like she's always in a hurry . Took my seven year old son to see her and he had a cough and cold , he accidentally coughed on her and she seemed disgusted by it . I will be looking for another pediatrician that can take seeing sick kids.  My three stars are for the staff, keep up the good work ladies.
4 Dr. Lui is great, really nice. Yeah you may have to wait a bit, but not too long in my opinion.
4 This is my Doctor's office. The staff is very professional and friendly. The place is clean and if your appointment is for 3PM, they will see you at 3pm; no 20 minute wait in the waiting room. There are several other services offered here, such as: acupuncture, chiropractic, dietitian and physio. For me, I have only visited with the family doctor, Dr. Bhardwaj, and he is an excellent physician. He is clear and takes the time to explain what I need to do to maintain a healthy lifestyle, and didn't make fun of me too much when I came in with second degree burns on my leg from climbing a rope.   The only reason why I didn't give the Adelaide Health Clinic five stars is that the family medicine is only available two days a week and the spots can fill up pretty quickly.
1 This office lacks professionalism down to the core.  They have no compassion for patient's care.  Very difficult to get a hold of staff or to get an issue resolved.. Even showing up in person offers no help whatsoever!! Save yourself the headache of dealing with this office's staff find a better office
1 I'm so disappointed with the Front Desk staff of this clinic. So unprofessional and rude.  I was just hung up on by Nancy because I requested her to talk to my Physician instead of making another appointment for something I have already been seen for.  The only reason I stay at this clinic is because of my doctor, but otherwise I would go somewhere else!
5 friendly staff. dr. butler always professional. very thorough. I love that theres hardly waiting period. im usually in and out, in a timely manner. dr. butler is a good listener and extremely patient when responding to my inquiries. so glad we switched to him this calendar year.
1 Avoid this place!  After treatment for my Mother, staff walked her out of instead of using a wheelchair.  While being escorted out by staff she fell in their hallway, broke her foot.  Trying to get them to reimburse her for foot care, they offered her $100 without acknowledging fault.  Also required her to sign a document that she would not disparage them.   She told them to keep there damn check.
5 Dr. Cristy is the best! She cares for her patients and actually prescribes the best supplements I have had. I had a herniated disc in my back (L5-S1 and 15mmx 11mmx 12mm and was told to get surgery to fuse it. She recommended a special fish oil and clean up my diet, as well as some other supplements that helped my back tremendously. I have taken fish oil before but this one was key to my success because she told me it is metabolized so I don't get the burp ups. I have seen her a few times and she continues to give me great care and make sure that all my questions are answered! I can't believe some of the other comments on her because it doesn't sound anything like her.   Thank you Dr. Cristy and I will be back.
5 For the last 9 months, I have been dealing with severe sciatic pain, caused by a herniated/slipped disc. I have two rounds of P.T.,had Chiropractic care, gotten regular massages, done pilates, had two injections, and acupuncture. I went from being very active, to barely being able to walk up and down the stairs (I am 47). I have spoken with a surgeon, who recommends surgery. In a last ditch effort and on the recommendation of a friend, I booked an appointment with Patricia. The first time I met her, I was immediately drawn to her nurturing, loving spirit, her desire to know exactly what was going on in my body, and her belief that she could help. And amazingly, after 9 months of often times excruciating, breathtaking pain, I am starting to feel a lot better. She, as a person, is just a beautiful, loving, kind, nurturing spirit, professionally, she is a master at her craft. If you are in pain, stressed, or just need some TLC, book an appointment with Patricia. You will not  be sorry and your body will thank you.
2 My grandmother has Alzheimer's and cannot be left alone at home. After trying to deal with this disease for the last 2 years, we finally figured out it would be cheaper to get in home care then for me to go home constantly. We called Team Select to find out more about some of the in-home care programs they provide. They we're very helpful with getting us into the right program. I feel it is a huge weight off my shoulders as well as my families to know that someone is at home with my grandmother. Making sure she is taking her meds, eating, and using the restroom. Thank you Team Select for helping out our family during this difficult time.
5 I can't say enough about the therapists there.  I've been to many doctors, PT PLACES, Chiropractors, you name it, and FOOTHILLS figured out the source of my pain-and came up with a plan to fix it, AND IT'S WORKING!!
5 Dr Dave's approach is the ONLY one that has helped me make progress with a very complicated back problem that I have struggled with for a couple of years.    Unlike many chiros that want you to stop in for a crack or two a week at $50 pop, Dr. Dave is going to teach you integrated exercises that stretch and strengthen ALL of the related muscles in the affected area.   Your progress is in your own hands and will also be much less costly.    I too was very skeptical after my first visit as his approach was soo much different from anyone else I had tried, but eureka! he was the ONLY one to help me make consistent progress.  When youre at the end of your patience with your pain (or before!) try Doctor Dave.  And do your assigned exercises!!!
2 Wait times weren't so bad, which is why I didn't give it only one star. My son saw Joe the PA and asked me never to bring him back there again, however. Joe reeked of cigarettes and was criticizing other patients right outside our exam room door.  Every visit, even as a new patient, took less than 5 minutes. The one follow-up, which we had to attend for lab results, was a staggering 3 minutes.   I work in the medical field and understand how the industry is changing, but Joe's dismissive and judgmental demeanor will never be welcome in this profession.
2 1 star to billing, 5 stars to PA Brooks and PT downstairs, 3 stars to Dr Brown because he's awesome as a Dr but stinks at correcting his awful billing dept.  We have to call our insurance co every time we get a bill because The Core consistently over-charges us by hundreds of dollars! When we call The Core's billing dept and tell them what we've been told by the insurance co, they agree with us, tell us they'll fix it and put in some notes so the next time we show up for an appointment we're not harassed by the front office staff telling us we're over-due.  However--they fail to communicate.  We've talked to Dr. Brown about it, he says he knows it's an issue, but then it doesn't change. We don't know if it's incompetence or something else.
5 Dr James Lo is mad cool. He tells you straight up about your problems and tells you how to fix it or make it better. His fast and there is almost no wait after the first time you go.  Also there are 2 massage chairs so you can use while your waiting. Sweet.
5 Dr. Marshall gives exceptional care and attention to his patients.  Scheduling is easy, he is very professional and thorough. We have tried quite a few chiropractors and can tell the difference in the quality of the service we receive from him. He is personable and lends his skills to produce positive end results through careful assessment and adjustment techniques.
4 I went last week on a Living Social Deal, the office was very nice and it was very easy to make an appointment.  Upon arriving for my massage I found the staff to be very very friendly and professional however I did not have a good experience with my massage.  I few days later I called the office just to inform them of my experience not wanting anything but to give feedback.  Amy was more than interested in my experience and immediately offered me another massage by a different therapist.  I just returned from my massage with Heather and it was great.  Again the office staff were more than courteous.  I then received a call from Dr. McDonald asking how things went.  I would return again based on their customer service.
1 There is no point of setting up an appt. Arrived 30 minutes prior to my appt. I was called in 2.5 hours passed my appt. staff was great. A total of 15 minutes patient care. 5 mins to take my vitals, height and weight. 5 mins to take my pee for drug screen. 5 mins for physical. Waited outside lobby again to wait for paper work. Total visit time of 3.5 hours for pre employment physical and drug screening.   I have never written a review before but I believe this review is necessary so people are aware of what they can expect from this place.
5 Ok first off, look up Rolfing.. look it up. Because you want to do it, I promise.  All those aches & squeaks & creaks with your body.. this pulls, that hurts, this is weak, and Im sure that never used to do that.. Yeah.. Rolfing fixes it most of the time..   When I began the ten-series with Jill my body felt like a beat-up jalopy that did not run nearly as well as I felt it should or could. I had lost my sense of center, my body felt discombobulated and as if it wasn't communicating with my brain or my desires of movement.   I was stiff and rigid in my jerky movements.  With each session my body's flow, rhythm, and sense of unity returned. I swooshed out of her office feeling like a human. The most lovely thing is that the changes that were accomplished have maintained.   Unlike other modalities that can just be band-aids, momentary, Rolfing has reminded my body of how it functions at it's best and my body is remembering.  And this is why you should call Jill.. your body is dying to remember how amazing it can feel.
1 Was in Vegas.  Enjoying the sights and sounds of this amazing city.  Suddenly after dinner the GF had a terrible stomach ache.  She didn't look well.  Asked the hotel if there was an after hours doctor.  They pointed us to Concentra, so the horror began.  We arrived at the 3rd world facility.  People there were a bit scary.  Right in front was a placard w/ prices.  $98 to see a dr.  $149 for tests.   Thankfully they accepted health insurance.  We put our name down to see a dr.  It was then we noticed really upset lady.  She said she had been there since 5pm.  It was currently 9pm.  She was waiting for the Dr to give her her perscription.  An hour goes by, nothing.  Another goes by nothing.  I get annoyed and ask the nurse repeatedly what is going on.  In this time two other patients give up and leave.  One tells me that the typical wait here is 3hrs.  My gf was in pain.  Didn't want to see what happened tomorrow.  Long story short.  They only have one dr there at a time.  So they are terribly overworked.  Dr is the one writing the report.  He was also the one calling other facilities.  He was also doing google searches for symptoms.  He was a one man show.  We didn't get out till 1:30am.  a 4.5hr wait.  I'm never going there again.
5 I needed physical therapy for my arthritic shoulder and tight hamstrings.  Allison Carter Jenkins was my therapist, and did a terrific job.  She is very knowledgeable, and cares about her patients.  In several weeks my hamstring issues were resolved and the range of motion in my shoulder really improved.  While the Sun Lakes facility is not large, it is well organized so that a good number of patients can be working out at the same time.  I recommend Allison and 360 Sun Lakes to all.
5 Do you want to sweat it up while busting a move? Well EVERYBODY DANCE NOW at METRO MOVEMENT!  I have been dancing since I was a tiny 3 year old and I owe this studio a lot in terms of keeping up my technique while sustaining my love and passion for dancing!  After returning home from university for good, I was looking for a dance studio in Toronto that would offer a plethora of dance classes - all levels and diverse types of movement. This is when I came upon Metro Movement.  The classes are well worth it because they are taught by amazing professionals and include all aspects of a dance class (barre, warm-up, stretching, technique, jumps and spins, and routine instruction) and the majority of classes run for at least 1.5 hours!  Here are the rates:  Single class: $13 Five classes: $60 Ten classes: $110 Twenty classes: $200  And they also offer just a Ballet Barre for $10 per time.  So whether you are a beginner dancer or a technical expert who has been dancing since in diapers, Metro Movement offers a little bit of everything to quench your dancing thirst!
5 This place was fantastic. I've had IT Band pain for the past year and after a half dozen treatments I'm feeling so much stronger and pain free.  Tom is very good at understanding the pain and how to approach the best process for each patient. Thanks again Tom and staff!
1 Came in looking for help with what was probably postpartum anxiety. Front desk staff was fantastic. However the PA laughed at me and was exceedingly condescending. She didn't have a sympathetic bone in her body. Shame because I live in the neighborhood behind and would have loved the convenience.
5 Holy mother of massage, batman! I may or may not have cried at how excellent my massage was at Toronto Bodyworks!  Since moving to T.O., I've always had massages with Ann at Camden Spa, who is awesome. She was out of town, however, and as my back had basically turned into a brick, I was in need of a massage. Yelp came to my rescue and, based on Lindsey and Kat's 5-stars, I made an appointment at Toronto Bodyworks. All I can say is OMG. It was *awesome*!!    I had Sarah and chose the 90 minute massage. Sarah sat with me beforehand to do an assessment of any problem areas and explained what she'd be doing. I was ill-prepared for the amount of stretching and pulling she'd do -- I've had my fair share of massages and I'd never had one like this one. It was seriously 90 minutes of pure bliss. And, while my back isn't perfect yet (thanks to my penchant for wearing 4" heels on a daily basis), it is in far, far better shape than prior to seeing Sarah.  You'll probably have to leave a message since their business is by appointment only, but they called me back within an hour on a Friday evening and I was able to make an appointment for the next day.   Do yourself a favour and run as quickly as you can to your phone and book an appointment. Now!
1 Its a shame that the wonderful Speech Therapists there are over shadowed by the horrendous business practices. Don't Do it Moms, don't schedule an appt here. We had a twice a week standing appt with a wonderful Therapist, we never missed any and were never late. We got a call that she had unexpectedly resigned and they would work to get us in with a new one as fast as possible. As disconcerting as it was to have to explain to my son that his therapist was gone and someone new would be working with him (sticking fingers in his mouth and holding his jaw and so on, he needs speech help) I agreed. We made an appt with someone new, she had a cancellation and were eager to go in.  MY son woke up with Dia, a fever, and his nose running and a loud deep cough, I called in two hrs before the last min appt and told them about my son.   THIS PLACE HAS A TEN DOLLAR canceled appt fee, I get it. They are covering their own to stop ppl from flaking. Every policy needs wiggle room. YOUR speech therapist resigned out of nowhere, we took a last minute appt with someone new and when I call in because my son is sick as a dog, they wouldn't budge on their policy. Absolute shame. They lost our business completely.   Forewarned parents.
1 Horrible service. Rude staff. Incompetent. Turned away my sick 1 year old! Would not see him. Denied him to be seen. Horrible! Will never return here or to any Banner Urgent Care ever. Off to the ER we go. Thanks for nothing!
1 Definitely go for second opinion . When we visited Dr Tindall for my mother's knee pain, all he was saying - I dont know what is happening, why so much pain.  He was in too much hurry since he had many patients lined up and waiting, when we asked questions, he even got angry just bcoz he was getting late for other patients. This is absolutely not expected behavior for patients who are visiting you since they are in pain and not for fun !!!
3 Wah! Dr. Chad Campbell left :( I would drive by many primary care offices closer to me just to see him!  Even though my favorite practitioner left (see above and previous review) I decided to give this place another try and opted to see another provider (after a rude scheduling with a receptionist whom I never spoke with before and didn't see her at my appointment). When I arrived I was greeted with a friendly smile and only had to wait about 10 minutes after my schedule appointment (it happens, no biggie). The MA was incredible with her bedside manner but the practitioner I saw was not. She never even shook my hand or looked up from her computer when she entered the room and had zero bedside manner or conversational skills. We only made eye contact when she was leaving the exam room. Upon her re-entering she was a completely different person looking up to me and making small talk. Turns out she read my chart and found out my profession and thus had more to say to me. Not impressed, I think I was spoiled with Dr. Campbell.  Looks like I'll be requesting a copy of my medical records and going elsewhere.
5 Dr. Barry is one of the best doctors in Las Vegas. She has been so helpful with all of my medical issues, is very thorough and prompt. I feel she is brilliant as a person but also very down to earth. She has been my doctor for several years now, and I am grateful to have her as my health care provider.
1 This place is ridiculous. I made an appointment for 2pm and didn't get seen until 3:30! Why? Because they took 3 walk-ins before me! I was even early to fill out paperwork and everything! Yet when I asked  the "nurse" at the front desk why I was being put after the walk-ins, she smirked and said it was because of a problem with my insurance. All I could think was how rude she was. The only positive to this building is Dr. Imani Williams-Vaughn. She's a sweetheart with spunk and I'm disappointed that this is where she works. This environment makes me want to leave and never look back, especially after the rude nurse. I do NOT recommend waisting your time here, all you'll get is frustration and stress.
5 I love this place ,really take care of                   You ,doctors and stuff are very professional.   They care about you. very good service.i really recommend this place to all my friends and family!!
3 Giving this location 3stars based on 2 visits. First 1-star, 2nd time was 5-star. Being a medical professional myself, I've come to expect some mutual respect between DR-NURSE-PHARMACIST etc but the first visit here didnt have it. I'm not a medical doctor, therefore when Im having a problem I still need to see one to prescribe for me. I've personally never gone to urgent care, but the excruciating back pain caused me too. wasn't quite ready to pay a hospital tab as I know more than most what that can cost. Working with the first technician, I could tell the lack of competence and overall care for his position. The PA I met with wasnt much better. Generally I am not the biggest fan of seeing PA's, especially paying doctor prices. However he was on staff and I was in pain. He gave me two shots that I knew would help so I agreed. I had a bad reaction to one, and his tech kept taking my blood pressure with the machine and it was not working right. They were freaking out over my BP of 90/40 which was false because Cuff wasnt fitting. I repeadtly told 3 different staff members after 3 attempts with this machine to take it manually because it was inaccurate. Also if my blood pressure was really that low I should not be told "call if you need anything we will be out here" I should be watched. I also informed the PA my current prescription was not cutting it for my pain, all he did was refill what I already have instead of prescribing something stronger. I get that younger people tend to drug seek, but this is where I expect that professional courtesy of trusting what I have to say and what I know works for me from personal experience and on the job experience. Needless to say, 3 days later I was back after the shot wore off and my pain meds (surprise surprise) weren't working at all and pain was worse. I wish I could have my $40 copay back and have debated calling their corporate office to do just that. The second visit was fantastic. This tech knew his stuff, was professional and friendly. He cared about my pain, properly Took blood pressure, and was overall excellent. Then saw Dr. Biscoe, an absolutely outstanding professional. He was courteous, listened to my needs, gave referrals I needed and helped get me to pain free. He looked at the whole situation, and trusted me as a patient. I wasn't treated at all like a drug seeker, but rather a patient with an actual real need and real pain. His compassion is outstanding and he is truely a medical professional. I wish more doctors could match his level of care. I'm thankful to know that Dr. Biscoe works here and is there for my urgent care needs until I find a primary doctor in the Valley. I hope he has a private practice because I would drive hours for the excellent care I recieved.
4 I was in a car accident and hurt my knee pretty bad. I went to see Dr. LaTourette  and I've never felt better. I highly recommend him to everyone;
5 I have been into clinic 24 a couple times. The first was for a comprehensive physical. This was a good experience for me. I then  returned for the results and met with the NP. She explained everything to me and made sure I understood everything clearly. I have also had the opportunity to see the nutritionist in the clinic a couple of times so far. She is awesome and isn't your regular stuffy Nuritionist that thinks everyone should weigh a certain amount and is obese due to the weight standards. She actually looks at you individually and took the time to understand my personal nutrition needs. All in all I have had very pleasant experiences at the clinic and would recommend to anyone.
5 I mean Dr. William Larsen's place.  Not just so close to my house, the staff are so friendly, considerate and passionate.  I rarely visit doctors' office and hard to find a good one in Charlotte, nevertheless, my previous insurance did not refer me to this place but gave me a couple that I had never had a treatment as I got lost in downtown or I could not find the place.  Four years ago, my son got a physical for college entrance and we accidentally went to Dr. Larsen's office.  Like them.  Early this year, I had a serious chest infection, got an appointment quick and had that fixed fast.    Then my boyfriend was referred by insurance to other place that he could hardly find.  After checking he could go to Dr. Larsen, my boyfriend was so happy with their service.   I just got my physical quick appointment with no hassle and check up the following day.  Good place.
5 I am so impressed with the professionalism and the expertise of the people I have dealt with here.  I had an initial visit with Dr. Lum, who was really great and was able to assess me quickly and answer all my questions. He recommended that I see Kim for physiotherapy and their chiropodist (didn't remember his name) for orthotics (which I use anyway). My initial visit with both was great. Kim showed me some great stretches to sort out my problem, and the chiropodist walked me through the best solutions for me, and a bit of the insurance claims process.  I've had two sessions with Kim now, and I really feel that they are helping. She's great to work with, disarming and personable, which is helpful since her job requires pushing/pulling/kneading parts of my body, which would be pretty off-putting if she weren't so nice.  I would definitely recommend anybody to see the team here. Everyone is great, from the practitioners to the front desk staff. Plus, it's right across the street from St. Andrew station so getting here is easy.
1 This is the first medical clinic in Toronto, Ontario and Canada that I've encountered to have a 'catchment' area.    Basically unless you have a residential address in or around Liberty Village - they won't see you.    It doesn't matter to them if you work in Liberty Village (and thus spend the majority of the waking time there) making it most convenient location to have a family physician in, rather than around your residence, used mostly for sleeping.  I have filed a complaint with the Ministry of Health.
5 I've always been impressed by the care I've received here. Having no serious issues, but rather, taking a proactive approach to health and wellness, I began seeing the chiropractor, naturopath, and massage therapist here. They are lovely people, the atmosphere is calm and relaxed, they see you on time and speak with indoor voices. The appointments take a little longer than what is normally stipulated, perhaps because you get undressed, etc. but they always give you the full time allotted for the treatment so it is worth the money. I like that the massage therapists consult with you about what's sore, what's bothering you, etc.  They sometimes show you stretches after the massage, as does the chiro. Very caring bunch. I always look forward to my next appointment. Professional receipts provided for insurance reimbursement.
1 I came here as a first time patient for a painful sore throat and received very rude treatment from the nurse and PA, Alyssa Gifford. Dr. Gifford seemed to have attitude and was in a rush to get me out of her office. She told me I have a bad virus that is going around and will get worse before it gets better, about 10 days until I'm better. I then asked for a doctor's note as I work the next three days following. The nurse came back with the note and I'm only excused for the day of the visit. Considering the doctor advised me to rest for a few days and that I will get worse before I'm better, I asked for her to give me one more day off to rest. The nurse then proceeds to tell me the doctor has left the building already (which is a lie as she was just in the room with me less than two minutes ago) and will not approve another day on the doctor's note. I've never had a doctor refuse to let a patient rest from work for the adequate time needed, just to get me to come back in the following day for more money from me. Ridiculous treatment, waste of my time and money. I felt as though they took my cold as a joke. Beware of this place, no bedside manner!
5 Putting our son in OT here was the best decision we have ever made. He has more confidence than ever and is so excited about everything that he does now. Mrs. Etna is absolutely amazing and our son completely loves her. They take the time to make sure that everyone of the goals are met and make sure that everything is going as it should! We can't thank you guys enough for everything you have done for our son!
4 Located in The Lakes Business Park, Desert Endocrinology is in building 8925.  It's actually a pretty nice office and the staff and doctors are fairly well versed.  The waiting room is somewhat strange shaped (like an L shaped) and I have to say that this was probably the first time I've seen back-to-back pharmaceutical reps go into a private practice.  That does bother me a little bit since you want to know that your doctors are giving the right drugs to help your treatment and not because some big pharma is saying so.  The one star off currently is due to the fact that they have a Quest tech that draws blood only in the mornings (7-12).  I don't think any endo I've been to didn't have a full time lab tech.
1 I waited for two hours to be seen by a doctor and it was only because I told them I was leaving and that the wait was completely unacceptable. Before the two hours they were stalling me by having a RA take my vitals, then an intern asked me a few unecessary questions. When I finally did see the doctor he rushed through some questions for about 5 minutes. There business model seems to overbook people and make them wait like cattle. They feel like they can get away with it because most of their patients are Mexicanos who speak English poorly or don't know how to complain. I cancelled my follow up appointment and switched doctors because I don't fee like being treated like a second class citizen. Son una desgracia.
5 Preferred Physical Therapy is amazing, and so are the staff! They are caring, concerned and  committed to making an improvement in your health and quality of life. Dana at the front desk, can sort out any crazy insurance issues, schedules appointment and is an inspirational young woman and makes coming to physical therapy feel like visiting family.   I have been suffering for years with arthritis in my neck and shoulders. At 57, was not looking forward to what the future and debilitation of arthritis would do to me. To my surprise, with  hard work under the guidance and knowledge of Nick at Preferred Physical Therapy; I am feeling better than I have in a very long time. I am looking forwarded to improving some more, enjoying life again and looking forward to many more active and enjoyable years with my family.
5 Dr Meyers has been my chiropractor for 3 years now and she is excellent!! I started seeing her immediately after a car accident as I had upper back/neck pain. After seeing her and doing physical therapy at their office, I very rarely have issues with my upper back and just go back for routine adjustments. Dr Meyers really listens to your concerns and always takes her time during visits. I have always had back pain due to an old track injury and have been to many chiropractors over the years. She is the best one by far and I feel great after leaving. The office is also very attentive and flexible. I have a very busy work schedule and she can always get me in same day. If you are in need of a great chiropractor, Dr Meyers won't disappoint!!
4 I joined in February and have been going 3-4 times a week. I absolutely love the boot camp style classes as well as the boxing and TRX classes. You know which ones are the most popular from how fast they fill up during sign-up time. The location is very convenient and the staff is mostly friendly. The other gym-goers mostly keep to themselves but are nice enough. I can't comment on the equipment since I only do the classes.  It is pricey but worth it for a good workout, and I am seeing results! I'll definitely keep going, even in the summer time, because there's no way I can motivate myself to do weight training the way these guys can.
3 Sometimes you have to wait for awhile, especially on Mondays when the university crowd comes in after a weekend of drunken stupors. Some of the doctors are good, it depends on who you get. Usually the good doctors take a bit more time, but the bad ones will rush you off. I had a doctor once who told me that I could only ask one question per visit, so I asked about my infection, but couldn't ask about my nose congestion. She demanded that I go back out into the lobby, and ask the secretary to swipe my health card for a second time in order to ask my second question about my nose.   I should also add that some of the secretaries are clueless, and when I say clueless I mean clueless. It took her a year to update my telephone number. I had 3 visits in one year, and each visit she would ask me to confirm my information, and I would ask her to update my number. Finally on the third visit she was able to get help with making the update.
5 Dr. Barbee is very thorough which is something that I didn't have with my last primary care physician. Her office uses "Patient Fusion" which is great way to communicate both with Dr. Barbee & Robin at the front desk.
1 This place is horrible. They state it is all about the kids but they treat the kids like products. Parents are lied to about appointments, scheduling, and evaluations. Its all about what type of insurance you have and how many appointments they can schedule. The owners and management are horrible to their employees which explains why the staff is always new. If I could give no stars I would.........
5 Great doctors & great staff ! And a big plus because its close to my by house. A+ Service !
5 I've had both my neck & lumbar spine (front & back) fused and after a freak accident that threatened the rest of my spine & caused debilitating headaches, Dr Yegveny Khavkin of NV Spine Clinic referred me here for Pilates based Physical Therapy.   The staff, from Front Desk to Therapists (Tina!) and techs are all knowledgeable, caring & super efficient. Being injured and having complications it was tough going at times to even make appts but they helped me every step of the way. Massage therapy is added and Shaighleen truly gives the best deep tissue I've ever had.   I "graduated" (diploma & all in last week Dec '11) after 6 months of work and healing there, I opted for the Post Rehab Pilates Classes to keep my spine healthy. First, I had a Private Session with Linda, she is very kind and patient and assessed & coached me regarding cues, etc. Now, I'm in a semi private class with maximum 6 people.   Still seeing Shaighleen bi-weekly for therapeautic massage and she is just magnificent, knows exactly where to work and does so without attacking my back and neck. Deep tissue without hurting me = amazing.   The only downside is they are located above Patisserie Manon and I must exercise willpower to avoid macaron overload.    They also offer Personal Training. If you or anyone you know needs PT, great massage or wants to try Pilates, go see the great team at Rapid Rehab.
5 Dr. Matt and Alex are the greatest! I had been feeling a slight strain in my back and a few mornings later I woke up very nauseous and sick. I thought I'd need to go to the hospital but Dr. Matt and Alex were able to see me that day.  They ran a few quick test and discovered I had a kidney infection.  They got me on antibiotics and checked in on me to ensure the medicine was helping.  They were super helpful. I highly recommend them.
5 This was my first experience with infrared and vibration treatments. I felt very good afterwards. The session helped reduce the intense pain I was having. Julie was great at explaining everything to me so I would understand what was going on. The studio is nice and clean and everyone is very attentive.
3 If you have a really basic injury, this place should be fine. But if you have a long term or complicated injury, and you're hoping this place will help when others haven't, I can't recommend it. Especially not for chronic pain. They go by basic, one-type-fits-all principles. If your pain and function aren't getting better, they don't listen (or even ask) and they can't seem to adapt or try different approaches. They just keep pushing the same methods, and imply that you're not trying hard enough. I suggest you look elsewhere, and I hope you get better soon!
5 I absolutely love this studio!!!  I have been to all of the Bikram studios in Phoenix and this is by far the best one. It is a very clean yoga studio! The instructors are awesome- I always learn something new and improve my practice with every class. I live about 20-30 min from this studio but make the hike because it's the best!
5 If you're looking for a yoga master teacher/guide/healer, your search is over!  Sam (Samantha) brings expert knowledge and experience in the areas of asana, pranayama, yogic philosophy/history and healing.   Give yourself the gift of a free consultation with Sam - she's amazing!
1 Dr. Barrettoko appears competent but has poor communication skills/ style.  She is not there to listen, and uses a standard approach to everything.  It does not feel like she is treating YOU but is following the manual.   She tries to make caring comments that appear to be and feel very superficial and awkward.  She talks fast and is in an out of the room as quick as possible to the point of rude.   I appreciate a straight forward approach and efficiency, but this was neither - just odd, very odd.  The office is very unprofessional and unorganized.  Patient care is not the highest priority. The Dr. has empowered her staff to treat people very poorly in the name of efficiency- HA!   They do not return calls, they are rude and have quite an attitude.  They also do not listen and they appear to be so caught up in the rules and their "'process" that they do not know what to do if the patient's need does not follow the script. I keep very clear notes on both my calendar and in carezone.com ( great medical app- check it out! ) and I note when I call , messages I leave, appointment notes, etc... The medical assistant Tabitha wanted to argue with me and her facts were flat out completely wrong.  She was so concerned about being right and defending her office mates when they had already screwed up multiple times before she decided to step in- really poor communication, business, and medical skills.  This is not the kind of Doctor I want to have taking care of me.   I would not recommend this office to anyone - subpar medical care and terrible office.
5 An urban surprise.  A great doctor who is easy to get an appointment with.  No voice mail..a real person answers the phone.  And they really do work to make health care affordable.  It is not just talk, they have some things set up.  As the the main priority.  I have seen a lot of doctors over the last few decades and I can recommend Dr. Moody without reservation.
4 A walk-in near my workplace at Bay and College that's usually quite busy. Sometimes the wait times vary at this clinic from 30 minutes to an hour so I highly recommend making an online appointment so your wait time is less than 20 minutes. The staff are okay at this clinic. The doctors are nice here and they have individual rooms where you are placed to see the doctor. You usually first see the nurse to get pre-assessed (taking information down, seeing whats wrong etc..) before seeing the doctor. They do have a pharmacy where you you get prescription medication, a vision centre and upstairs where you there's medical imaging available for xrays. Not a bad clinic considering it's a walk-in. Probably one of the better ones that  I've been to in terms of an operation standpoint.
5 Dr. Pillai is the best doctor that I have ever had and Dr.Jodi Sharma went out her way to $aved the day; $ave being the operative word.  She saved me from spending more time in pain ,the pain of paying co-pays, time that it takes to get a referral and schedule a surgery (minor) & money for the taxpayers (i have medicare). I wish all health care professionals cared this much with our overwhelmed health care system and Obama-care nightmare.
5 I have been going to Alpha Chiropractic on and off for the past few years.  Dr. Robertson was recommended to my through Team in Training friends.  I have seen him for neck, shoulder, back, and even some foot and ankle issues.  I also recommend their massage therapists, I have had a good experience with several of them!  The office staff is friendly and it is a comfortable and laid back atmosphere.
5 I've been a patient of Dr. Ezrre's for nearly 9 years and she has supported and helped me through a hysterectomy and then years later discovered a 3 lb. tumor in my abdomen other doctors missed.  She treats the whole person - emotional, mental and physical.  Dr. Ezrre worked with me during menopause and continues to stay on top of my treatment.  She has also treated my 25 year old daughter for years whether it be mono or most recently Bells Palsy.  Having a doctor who thinks of you as a person and not a number is a beautiful thing!!
5 Health Source South and their wonderful staff are definitely a five star organization. Dr.David and Patty and her PT staff have helped me maintain and improve my health.
5 Pam was very professional and extended herself to explain how to do each exercise in detail .  She was very patient with me and supplied videos on line that I could use to review my program. Also unlike other clinics,I was treated by the PT not handed off to an assistant.
3 This review is for the massage services, only...  Signage out front lures you in, as it proclaims "$19 for one hour massage"...but note that the offer is for first time clients, only.    I bought gift certificates for a couple family members one Christmas, and also one session for myself.  We were able to schedule two simultaneous appointments, but that was the maximum because they employed only two massage therapists (at that time, at least).  When we filled out the paperwork as first time clients, it became evident that their goal was to sign us up for a membership.  The staff also brought this up at every possible opportunity.  Be forewarned that the introductory offer is seemingly just a means to get you in the door and sign up for ongoing sessions at a much higher (per-session..? monthly..? yearly..?) cost.    The lobby area of the office was actually quite nice, not exactly a spa-type environment but there were some nice decorative touches.  The rooms where the massages took place were a slightly different story.  The one I was assigned to was rather outdated, brightly lit (lots of windows), large and impersonal, and seemingly multi-functional (chairs, tables, personal belongings here and there), not to mention freeeeeezing cold.  It was also right next to the main road outside so traffic noises were quite audible.  I'm not a massage snob, not trying to be hyper critical, but the room temperature and noise made it pretty difficult for me to relax.  As for the massage therapists, apparently the woman who worked on my family members was great, really knew what she was doing.  Unfortunately, the same can't quite be said about the young gal I was assigned to.  I don't want to drag her through the mud but clearly she didn't have a whole lot of experience.  She seemed a bit unsure and barely spent any time on the areas where I really could've used some work.  She brushed quickly over the entire lower and upper back, shoulders, upper arms, and neck, and instead focused a puzzling amount of time on my shins, of all places.  And although she put hardly any noticeable pressure on the rest of my body, the shin treatment was unbearably painful and relentless...she kept going over and over them to the point where I couldn't control my involuntary flinching and had to ask her to stop.    In all honesty, my massage left me more tense than I had been to begin with.  It wasn't quite the relaxing experience I'd hoped for.  And what further upped the awkwardness factor was when my massage therapist came to me, after I'd finished getting dressed, with a fee sheet and asked me when I would like to schedule my next session with her.  Ummm...thank you, but, ummm...        As I said, my other family members were super pleased with their massages, so it's not all bad, I just personally had a less-than-wonderful experience.  My advice, if you decide to schedule an appointment, is to ask ahead of time about each therapist's qualifications and tenure so you can specify at that time who you'd like to see.  And bring warm, fuzzy socks.  And shin guards.
5 Clean and very nice staff, My first time getting infrared wraps I felt comfortable I was explained the process, I will definitely come back
5 This place is so cute and clean! Wasn't sure what to expect- I hadn't done an infrared wrap before and bought a Groupon here. While I am still on the fence to whether the wraps do much, I think its good to get a good sweat going and definitely prefer a wrap to sitting in a sauna or steam room. It's super relaxing for the most part and you can just hang out and watch Netflix or read for an hour.
5 Extremely happy with Gilbert Pain Management. Friendly knowledgeable staff with excellent doctors! Dr. Dr. Casady has been life changing!!! Feel totally aligned and he has brought my pain level from a 7-9 all the way down to a 0-2. I'm heavily involved in Crossfit and running. Feeling amazing and highly recommend!
4 Had to go for an emergency. Staff, doctor and nurses were awesome. Kept us up to date on all the exams, labs etc done to my daughter. Experience was good. Would recommend if an emergency situation arises.
5 Despite the previous reviews I read about the hospital, I was well taken care of. I had a surgery for my appendix and they provided me with the best care. My own room, meals were good, they took time to explain me the procedure and what was wrong.   I recommend this hospital..I mean if you have to go to it otherwise being home is definitely better!
3 I come here to see Dr. Evenson and when he's not there, then I would see Dr. Coy. Dr. Coy's a trip! I love this guy! The Filipina ladies at the front desk are quite rude though esp. in person and over the phone.
5 I am very excited to have this new addition in the heart of the Junction.  The facility is beautiful, inviting and well-equipped. The staff is fantastic and you can find any health practitioner for your needs - RMT, ND, Chiropractor, Physiotherapist all in one place.  Dr. Farian, the owner of the clinic, has been in the health and fitness industry for a long time and is passionate about health and well-being.  I am looking forward to coming here for our health needs!
5 Dr Retamoza has been my chiropractor for over 14 years.  His staff is so nice and professional.  I drive way out of my way to come see Dr. Retamoza and the reason is the quality of care and the connection I have made with him and the staff over the years. He really does care.
5 Sarah is extremely knowledgeable about the spine. She has helped me more than any other physical therapist. She is caring and also very committed to helping to eliminate pain naturally. I would recommend her highly for anyone who is in any kind of pain. Especially before they entertain the thought of surgery.
1 Visited today and unfortunately had a horrid experience. I was told upon arrival it would be less than a 45 Min wait. I Sat in the front lobby without seeing a doctor for over an hour an a half, mind you this is midweek morning and only 3 people in the lobby upon arrival. After hearing the receptionist Michael T. tell patient after patient that walked in the wait was only 45 minutes I decided to ask him how long it was really going to be because I didn't have 3+ hours to be waiting as I had already been there  for 90+ minutes.   Michael told me his manager tells him to tell everyone 45 minutes, even if they know it isn't true. I told him I couldn't believe that his management would have him blatantly lie to sick people in the lobby just to get them to stay but he insisted he would get fired for telling the truth. Michael then got really rude and short with me saying "well we never know how long it will take" which i stated i can understand that however when you have a lobby full of people who have been waiting for over an hour and a half and you tell the client that just walked in you expect her sick daughter to be seen in under 45 minutes thats blatantly being dishonest and I choose not to to business with people like that, maybe its just the guy @ the front I don't know buy I want the only one walking out this morning.
1 I am so very disappointed with all aspects of this office.  Long scheduled appointments are cancelled at the last minute, then rescheduled at their convenience, important details are overlooked or miscommunicated, most calls made into office go without response, long waits to be seen, etc.   I have decided to change physicians.  My time & health are my most important possessions.  I will not squander them at Velda Rose Medical Center.
5 I've been here a few times now. First couple times I dealt with Jacky (owner) and he was awesome. Very detailed (massage therapy and chiropractic appointments).  Recently I returned on a whim to deal with an unexpected issue. Jacky wants available so they paced me with Andrea. I received an hour and a half massage. Needless to say, I've rebooked with Andrea already. I've had tons of massages in my life and the best two people have been at this location.  If there was a Canadian all-star team for massage therapists, Andrea would be on it. Well done Jacky. Keep hiring superstars.
3 I've never encountered being told, by a doctor, that because I'm seven minutes late I can't be seen. I expect to wait if there is standing room only and I expect to pay a fee if I skip a scheduled appointment. However, if there is no one in the waiting room and a person is obviously  ill, why would you even mention turning them away? A person who came in after me, who had an appointment 20 minutes after mine and was seen before me, so how full were they really?   New patients must be aware that if you are seven minutes late you may not get the help that you need. If you require a doctor's office with more flexibility then I suggest that you find a different office. But, before you do, check their time scheduling policy.   That being said, once you get past the clock police, the attention given by the nurses and doctors is a little better than you would find elsewhere around the valley. The nurses are great and personable. Like many offices in the valley, I don't have a regular doctor. There is a cohort of doctors and unless you specify a certain doctor you will most likely be seen by whoever is on staff. This is a problem all over the Valley not just at this office. I hope this review provided some helpful information.
5 I love Head To Toe Therapy. The receptionists are always friendly and very helpful. The facility is spacious, clean and child friendly. It is obvious it is well-cared for. There is free valet parking available on site during the busy times to facilitate ease in the parking situation. Professionally, therapists give their all while giving total attention to their patients during treatment sessions. Thank you Head To Toe Therapy for all that you do for our kiddos
1 These people have more then a handful of bad reviews for a reason. They are awful!! I've been in the service industry for 12 years and it makes me sick the lack people skills these people have. Just like other reviews said, they will make you feel like the inconvenience. I just so happened to be running late and made sure to call them to let them know and asked if i should still come or reschedule and they told me to come. Almost an hour and half later I'm still sitting in the waiting room while I watched 9 people that came in after me be seen by the doctor and leave. I then asked how much longer I need to get my kids from school and why are so many other people going in before me..they say that the follow up patients are seen before consultations.. Ok... I then start questioning this and "because the follow ups are quicker they are seen first." So if follow ups keep coming in I just keep waiting? Is this a joke? I understand I was running a little late and made sure to call and ask if it was okay and still I'm sitting here and told I won't be called back to a room for 30 more minutes. So that's 2 hours just to get into a room..! You have to be JOKING! I told them I need to reschedule (after already waiting 1 1/2 hours) but they have no openings for another month lol. NEVER again will I step foot in this shit hole. Also it's maybe 50 degrees outside and they have the AC on and other people were complaining they are freezing. Take a wild guess, NOPE they don't give a shit.. I will just sit here a little longer freezing my ass off.
5 I was very impressed with this facility.  Amanda, who did my x-rays was great.  Found out we share the same birth date and that started other conversations.  I love to ask questions and I had a question about the x-rays and he explained it to me in a way that I could understand.  Truly a professional.  And when I found out he moved here from the South to care for his Grandmother, I knew this guy was awesome.  The girls at the front desk, Beatrice and Amanda, were quick and very polite.  When you walk in you smell the aroma of fresh baked cookies, yum.  Gives you a warm and friendly feeling.
5 OMG! Dr. Stevens, Dr. Cameron and their team of wonderful massage therapist at Global Chiropractic are hands down the only people you should see.  After my accident I started seeing Global Chiropractic for care. Ive never felt so relaxed after an accident till I started going here. At Global Chiropractic, they care! Every visit has been amazing. Theyre willingness to heal you just shows how much they take pride in what they do here. Gotta say, I dont know who else to go to. Thank you Global Chiropractic, you guys are awesome!
5 Dr. Carr was great.  I woke up in pain and he managed to fit me in right way, despite the fact I have never been to his office before.  He has a great personality, easy to talk to, and takes him time to get you feeling better.  My pain is not fully gone after the one visit, but I will be returning  to keep my spine in order.
1 4 Hour wait, no nurses. Please go in and watch the PA's fumble around, the medical assistants pretending to be nurses. The owner Wow- the messiah complex of all doctors.  Please get back to yelp to know if you feel the same way.  Then you will have to go to a real doctors office and pay your co-pays again to get treated by real medical professionals.
1 Found the practice on ZocDod. The front office staff Elizabeth is cold and didn't smile to any of the patients while I was in the waiting room. Dr. Perales was very kind in person. A couple days after I finished a medication Dr. Perales had prescribed I was feeling a lot of discomfort. I called and left a message at 7:30ish am. The office opens at 8am. After my call was not returned I called back around 8:15am, was unable to talk to the doctor was told by Elizabeth "She's on another call, she'll call you back as soon as she's done", no call back. Called around 9am, was unable to reach the doctor. I asked for a time frame of when I could expect a call back Elizabeth would not give me one.. Called again around 11am and Elizabeth was incredibly rude. She would interrupt every time I would talk. I could not get a word in, she made no attempt to hide the fact that she doesn't care what my problem is and the doctor would call me back when free. Finally Dr. Perales called me back around 12pm. The was now equally as rude and did not listen to what I had to say. I was under the impression doctors are supposed to listen and understand her patients (If you want your problems dismissed and time wasted this is the place for you). When I mentioned looking for another primary care physician Dr. Perales said, "yes, you should do that". Then said, "I was so nice to you when I saw you"... Is  not standard for doctors to be nice to every patient? The lack of professionalism practiced at this office is disappointing. Think twice before dealing with them, they're nice to you as long as you're paying them.
3 My wait time was pretty normal for a Sunday, about 20-30 minutes. When I walked in, the front desk made it seem like a bother I was there, and the door to the waiting room slams anytime someone opens it. Once I was brought back and checked out, the experience turned around. The nurse/xray tech was very nice and talkative, she did not seem like she was just going through the motions.   One thing I have noticed about this company as a whole, they say they have doctors, but I have never once been seen by an actual doctor. Not that it matters to me, PA or nurse practitioner can handle it in my opinion, but for those that are not okay with that, you should probably go elsewhere.
1 Psychology department and patient relation department of WCH  I was waiting on a waiting list to see a doctor. They called me eventually for giving me an appointment. After a few days, another person called me and asked me to meet another doctor who had a cancellation and can visit me earlier than my real appointment. When I met her I remembered her that was a horrible doctor when my sister a few years ago was her patient. I contacted patient relation department and explained my issue and I want just to change my doctor. They asked the same doctor find a new doctor for me. its more than one month passed and nobody calls me yet, Also patient relation manager (Kathy F)doesn't respond any of my emails or calls. Does it mean I have to shut up and stay with whoever you refer me to visit even if your doctor is a real stupid and she needs more than anyone else to see a psychiatrist to fix her problems?
3 If you come to see her be prepared to leave your kids at home, eat before because even if u make appointment youre gonna wait a very long time. Shes very nice and pay attention to your concerns which i think is the reason why people still see her.
5 I use Dana Parsley for physiotherapy and Dax Wilcox for personal training.  Both are absolutely excellent and have totally blown me away!  I started to see Dana because I had sprained my ankle quite badly in May, which got better, but then spontaneously got much worse again a month later, so I thought I should get it checked out.  After seeing Dana only twice, she improved my healing exponentially as she showed me stretches to help heal my ankle properly.  I had also hurt my hip and Dana helped it heal very quickly!  I then started to see Dax Wilcox for personal training in hopes of getting stronger to prevent injuries like this, and of course to lose a bit of weight as well.  Today is day 90 since I have started with Dax.  I have lost 9 lbs (from 136lb to 127lb) and 5% in body fat.  I could never get under 133lb no matter how hard I tried by myself (originally 163lb) and Dax has broken me through that barrier.  At first, I didn't think that I was working that hard because I wasn't really sweating too hard or even feeling any pain after a session, but after a while I noticed that my clothes were fitting a little more loosely.  I have been watching my eating, but not completely restricted as I do enjoy going out to eat a lot with the occasional drink.  Dax looks at everything holistically and looks at muscle movements and how each muscle works with each other.  It's not like a personal training at a gym where they make you do all these exercises that make you hurt the next day.  The exercises that Dax gives me has improved my posture as well as increased my strength in the muscles that need it.  I definitely recommend both Dana and Dax!
5 I've been going to Dr. Steve for a few years now with my family and he has done wonders for us all.  When I first came in I could barely walk because of a bulging disc in my lower back.  Thanks to Dr. Steve and all his work I can now enjoy my kids and go hiking again.  I recommend him for everyone!
5 Dr. Karen Ngo rocks!  I injured my lower back by accidentally going to full extension on leg press (ouch!).  Karen saw me a few days later, on a Sunday, as the back was still painfully stiff and sore.  She spent an hour on the assessment and then amazing acupuncture with electric current, adjustments, and facial stretching.  At the end of the session, my back felt great, the stiffness was gone!  As a competitive bodybuilder, this was very good news as I could get back to the gym a lot sooner!
1 It's 8:56p.m, and their down to one Dr. The receptionist is telling people to come back tomorrow or go somewhere else. It's 11:47 I have just been released. I went for a needle stick on the job, I left with no preventative treatment. They intend on waiting until something is present. So hopefully I don't get hepatitis or hiv while waiting. I wouldn't suggest coming here.
4 I really love this massage therapy clinic and have had nothing but the greatest of experiences there, until this morning. :(   Bodyworks sends a 24hour email reminder for all appointments, and when I hadn't received mine, I called to inquire. The receptionist said that this, and another appointment I had booked weeks in advance (which we were able to re-confirm right away) appeared to be cancelled.   When I asked why/how this would have happened, the receptionist said that because they write all appointment down in pencil (with no backup), my bookings were either erased or were written in pencil too lightly. Because of this, it was presumed that my appointment was cancelled and re-booked by another client. The receptionist did offer me a bunch of different options to help rectify the situation.  I am extremely disappointed, as I have been receiving massage therapy for many years, and I have never experienced an administrative error like this, but this type of error is not a reflection of the clinics quality of service.
1 I have been a patient at Complete Care Medicine  for well over a year. I followed my doctor to this practice, but she has since left.   I went in today because I've been sick with a cough and sinus congestion  since July. (My previous dose of antibiotics from Urgent Care didn't do the job.) I was told they would electronically submit a prescription for antibiotics and cough suppressant, however, when I went to the pharmacy, there was no prescription for the cough suppressant. I called the office and left a message explaining this, but never received a call back. My chest is so sore from the constant coughing and I've been keeping my husband and myself up at night. I'm so disappointed at the lack of follow through or concern for the patient.  I'd like to also note that my eyebrows were raised when they had me sign off on their updated patient policy when checking in. They must have a real issue with making patients mad, because it even addresses what happens if you curse at them. In addition, the policy goes on about what they refuse to treat (perhaps this is why the cough suppressant wasn't prescribed). The policy was the nastiest I've ever read and raised a serious red flag. I would not recommend this practice.
1 If I could rate no stars, I would.  Took my son there with flu symptoms, he was given an antibiotic.  Dr. Faulkner said he needed booster shots and asked me to.make an appt for another later.  Came in s month later and she was confused as to why we were there as he wasn't old enough for the booster shots.  Co pay down the drain as well as wasted time.  Then he had a splinter on the bottom of his foot and we just couldn't remove it ourselves.  Called and got an appointmemt, she asked why we were coming in.  I was very specific about his condition to the person making the appointment.  Showed up and the Dr poked her head on the room and announced that they don't remove foreign objects and told me to go to an urgent care facility.  I am fed up with this unprofessional office and will find a new Dr.
5 These guys were very helpful to our family in a very important time of need. My brother ali knew of him and made an appt. My nephew tripped over his bed and hurt himself.  Being a 12 yr old this is understandable to most parents.  Dr. Ghadishah was beyond helpful.  This is not a fake review.  This is complete legite. He recommended us to a specialist for a mri to ensure that he is all fine. Thank god everything turned out the way it did after such a silly and unnecessary accident.  They recommended 2 weeks of rest due to the new approach dr.'s take regarding any injury related to the head.
5 I've been a patient of Dr Francesca for 2 years with nothing but praise for the Dr and her staff! I'm 63 and I think Dr Francesca Chamian is the best Dr. I've ever had! You can feel she truly cares about her patients. Her staff is awesome!
3 I went to this place for my children who needed therapy (OT, PT, and SP).  One of my children is developmentally delayed and at three could not eat solid food.  He was only eating baby food and drinking from a bottle.  Christine (speech therapist) worked WONDERS with him.  She got him to start eating soft foods like oatmeal and pasta.  Also got him to open his mouth when presented food to at least try new things.  She is AMAZING!    My biggest problem with this place is that I had tried for all most three months to get them to schedule my other two children in for PT and more SP.  Then I moved and gave up on them and went to their other office across town but I miss Christine!  If you are looking for a REALLY great speech therapist who also works on feeding issues see Christine.
5 This is the ultimate in urgent care. It's new, clean and friendly. I was impressed with the whole staff. Had a sinus infection and was able to get the needed care in just a short time. There was an assistant who was new and doing just fine but the Dr. Followed up on what she did to make sure the results were correct.    They have a pharmacy on hand and the prices were better than what I would have paid other places. The pharmacist accompanied the asst as she went over the prescriptions with me.  I even got one prescription free by checking in on Yelp.   I would recommend this place without hesitation.
5 The whole staff at the Las Vegas Pain Relief Center does An outstanding job! Everyone is so helpful.  I have been to many different physical therapy practices all over Las Vegas to help with my back problem. I never felt like it was getting the care it needed to heal. After the first session with Dr. Robey and Miles I felt immediate pain relief. Each and every time I go back it keeps getting better and better. The doctors and staff here really know what they are doing. They are far ahead of the game when it comes to recovery and fixing and physical problems. I would recommend this practice to anyone dealing with and physical issues. The people at the Las Vegas Pain Relief Center make you feel like family and genuinely want to help fix any problems you may have.
5 How does this place seriously not have any Yelp reviews?! Craziness. Went here for the first time today and saw a PA, Christina Cousins... she is awesome! She takes the time to explain things and answers any questions very thoroughly. She is also not a pill pusher at all, makes sure you are totally comfortable taking medications and you know what they are  before she prescribes them.  So, while I can't speak for any other PA's or MD's here, I can say that she made a dreaded doctors visit very pleasant.
2 I have recently gone to see Yvette. Yes, the studio is very nice, and she is very approachable. Yet honestly I have had better massages. I went mostly because of the rave reviews here, on yelp. I still felt my muscles were kind'a tight after the massage, which is normally not the case after. I recognize that different approaches work for different bodies, yet Yvette's def did not work for mine.
5 Dr. Ruddell does a great job for people injured in car accidents.  He delivers results and patient satisfaction.  Highly recommended!!
1 Very disappointed in the sanitary conditions. Ended up filing Health Dept. Complaint. Advertising says Gourmet Chef food was not anything close, some meals good, most not. Place smelled like urine and #2. Observed staff drop the latex gloves on floor and put them back in with the clean ones. Once someone even cleaned portapotty bowl in sink where personal hygiene was conducted, e.g. brush tedth etc. They don't even have real ice bags for pain relief, used blue ice wrapped in bubble wrap.
4 Yeah, so the doc is almost always late but on the other hand if you really need time to ask questions, etc he makes it for you.  Staff is friendly and I personally like joking around with them when I can. No insurance mess ups or anything ever and they seem pretty efficient and happy with their jobs.
5 Where's the sixth star? Nothing short of an incredible experience with this team of doctors!  I really mean this... Unfortunately, I am someone who falls in the category of someone who has not taken proper care of their back until it was too late.  I had collapsed three times to the floor with bad back spasms after a big photo shoot one day (I'm a photographer). I was scared to death and didn't know where to go.  Several people had suggested seeing a chiropractor, which I hadn't done in years because of one not so helpful experience I had. I came to Dr. Staub after being referred to him by a very credible person who holds the highest of standards.  This was the best thing I could have done! I even collapsed right in front of him on my first visit! His patience, generosity with his time, expertise and caring nature instantly made me feel at ease while I was experiencing the worst pain of my life. Since that day, he was able to diagnose my herniated disc and take quick action to get it to heal naturally.  I created a plan with Dr. Staub to incorporate decompressions, adjustments, massage and correct stretching exercises all through his office. Today marks the seventh week into my recovery and I have bounced back much faster than general rate of recovery for this type of injury. I ask lots of questions, learn what I am doing and why... communicate openly about everything like the intense fear I have been feeling through this journey to recovery. Had I known him before, my disc wouldn't been as bad as it is today but I can't imagine where I'd be had I not met him at all! I would probably be looking seriously at surgery and injections that of course aren't the ideal ending if possible. At times like this, there is such FEAR! If you have any back pain at all, I'm telling you... this is your guy! Don't be scared, don't put off the smallest of symptoms and just trust me that no matter what your personal pain issue might be, I have confidence that he's someone who can offer a lot of help to you. Back pain is real and it is manageable when you do the right things. You need someone who has a strong sense of integrity, a high quality education with lots of experience and has bedside manner to relate to you so they can get to know everything about you to help you. These are your guys!  They take service to a new level, everyone seems like family in their office and their passion for genuinely helping people is clear. Don't be stupid like me and wait until your body gives out on you to show you what's wrong. Trust me, it's not fun and very scary when you are dealing with your back. I am so grateful for these guys and I really wanted to make sure other people who are looking for quality chiropractic care can stop right here because they are the best!
5 awesome service. nice and clean office. alwaya love coming here. great and fantastic team
5 I went to Tammy for my massage and it was great  she is very professional and listened to the problems I was having and worked them out. I rebooked and Can't Wait. Thanks Tammy.
1 I'm so angry right now, I had to take a shower to cool off! One star is too many to give you. Shame on you! For months I have been trying to get something done with my elbow and shoulder pain.  I've gone through all the stupid tests and treatments everyone has come up with. I don't want opioids or anything other kind of pain meds, (they push freely BTW) all I have asked for is a cortisone shot to get rid of my pain and swelling. MY incompetent Dr, "I use the term loosely"  ok'd for me to finally get a cortisone shot in my KNEE! WTF? My Knee? Who's damn file where they looking at? This is total incompetence. What makes me even more angry is if I want to switch doctors I have to get it ok'd from the moron that wants to give me a knee injection. So yup I did it, canceled my damn appt which btw is 6 weeks out and that's not even for a damn shot. In parting, some of us are actually in pain not looking to be drugged out but looking for pain relief. I should have known better from the lousy 1 1/2 star rating they have. If your looking for a pain clinic.....keep looking and save your time and money!
5 I chose this place to treat my back injury after meeting with several chiropractors that seemed dishonest and money hungry.  I tried 4 physical therapists at this location.  Angie is the best hands down.  Melissa is good too. The staff is super nice and they get to know every patient really well.  My only complaint is that I asked the front desk several times how much everything was going to cost and they wouldn't give me a straight answer. They just kept saying, "It depends," or "we don't know yet."  Needless to say, I wasn't happy with the big bill I received later.  However, I would definitely come back here to get treated by Angie again.
3 So I wrote a pretty long review about Dr Liu and his staff 2 weeks ago and it was completely negative because of my bad experience. Multiple things went wrong on my surgery day, then I felt like they forgot about me after my knee surgery and just didn't care for me at all, so I wrote my first review ever as kind of a cry for help to finally get someone's attention. Well I'm glad I did because it worked and his assistant finally called me to come in for a private one on one meeting with Dr Liu.  He explained to me why I had all the complications that I had. The main problem I had was that no one ever called me after my surgery like they said they would. His assistant Megan was supposed to call me 2 days after my surgery to go over everything. I was sent home with minimal instructions and had a lot of questions and concerns, so when I never heard from her I tried calling several times throughout the week. My dad even got involved and left several voicemails as well, but no one ever called us back.  When I went in for my first post op appointment 2 weeks after my surgery, I thought I was going to see Dr Liu but I met with Megan instead. I told her about some of the problems I had on my surgery day and that no one ever called me afterwards so I didn't know how everything went, plus I was concerned because everything the doctor had told me wasn't the way things turned out. She seemed clueless and didn't explain anything. She acted like it was no big deal and was very short with me. I was hoping to leave there with some answers but I left feeling even more dissatisfied.  So when I spoke to her about it today in front of Dr Liu she said that she calls every patient after surgery, so maybe my mailbox was full or not set up. I just laughed and said no my phone and mailbox work just fine. Then she apologized and walked out of the room.  My next appointment is in 3 weeks and it was supposed to be with Megan again, but before I left the office today Dr Liu changed it so I'm meeting with him instead. I appreciated that.  I'm really glad that Dr Liu reached out to me, it meant a lot. He said that he's changing a lot of their protocols so this won't happen again.  As long as my knee heels fine then that's all that really matters.. It just wasn't the experience that I was hoping for.
3 Pay $1100 every pack for insurance and you would think 1. They would answer a fax, 2. The fax, I printed drove to them and still was charged.  Dr. Martin is by far one of the best doctor's I've know. If you can get a hold of him. The staff, unfortunately, sucks. Flat out the worse group I've ever seen. Funny thing is that I've been going there for over a year now and only 1 person remains. Others let they WERE GOOD! That's when the office worked great!!!! Not sure what changed but think twice about going th9s route.   I've heard some interested stories about the owner. Las Vegas isn't that big of a city. Especially on my career field. Dr. Martin is the best if you can get past the front office. They've caught so many panic attack that I' heading to another hospital to calm down. I bust my ass to get back into shape and over my injuries at the same time.
5 The entire staff has been wonderful to my family. Both of the doctors are wonderful with us and the front office staff is helpful and kind.   My back went out on me and I was so afraid I wouldn't be able to drive or work. Their care helped get me back up to my normal self. My back is very important in my line of work and I didn't even have to miss a day thanks to them.   I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for chiropractic help. My girls even ask to be adjusted by them, so you know they are very child friendly as well. Thank you everyone!
3 Likes: - Great massage - Friendly and knowledgeable therapists - Efficient booking by email  Dislikes: - Constant noise from streetcars on Queen street - Smell of food from neighbouring business while you are trying to relax.  Will definitely come back.
1 I will never come back to this place, I had the worst experience I could ever imagine here. Over a year ago I had tests done on my chest and heart area due to pains and I was diagnosed with having valvular heart disease. The person I was seeing at the time was Laurie Michlin. She told me I had two valves that didn't close all the way so they work extra hard which is part of why I feel the pain and discomfort I do.  I came back almost a year and a half later because I was continuing to have pains with my chest and heart. Which I couldn't seem to go a day without so I finally made an appointment. This time I saw Guatham Reddy. I sat down and the moment the word heart disease left my mouth, the horrific experience started. He had this look of disbelief on him and then sarcastically asked me if I had any tests done. I then told him not only did I have an EKG but one other test done on me. He went to my results and said you are a perfectly fine 23 year old stop worrying. I couldn't believe what he was saying, the same results that diagnosed me with valvular heart disease is the same results he's looking at telling me I'm fine. As I try to explain my confusion and frustration on how can a person who saw me in this same exact building tell me I have heart disease and then have you tell me I'm fine. He tells me that everybody can read results differently. I then asked him so differently that one day you can be diagnosed with heart disease and the next not? He then snapped at me and asked if I was "wanting" something to be wrong with it. I told him I don't "want" anything to be wrong with it but I was told something was wrong and that's why I feel the pain that I do. So if I'm a perfectly fine 23 year old, he stated my age so many times I lost count that I finally had to say age doesn't defy your health, then why am I having this chest and heart pain constantly? He then had the nerve to tell me that everybody has a leakage in the hearts and that could be why. Mind you, when Laurie Michlin told me my pain was caused by having valvular heart disease, she told me my valves don't close all the way so they work extra hard which is why I feel the pain and discomfort. Which is why I was diagnosed with heart disease. So if leakage is normal, why didn't she think that and why did she diagnose me with heart disease? I was completely lost and confused by what he was saying and I wasn't getting any answers along with the most disgusting attitude I have ever seen from a DR. You would think he would offer to run tests on me or something to confirm or deny I had heart disease and why I have this pain. Instead he wanted to claim that my young age defines my health. He laughed in my face when he saw I was getting upset so I got my refund and left. I will never come back to this place. I have never been so disrespected in my life. Guatham Reddy made an assumption about my health the very moment he saw me and my age. He didn't listen to any of my concerns and he blatantly disrespected me. He had no interest in helping me that day. I will never recommend this place to anybody. I would never want anybody to feel what I felt that day...
3 Been coming here since I was a kid. The only one I ever see anymore is Ann. She is the best! She is very caring and is never in too much of a rush to get me out the door. She may not be a Dr., but I would take her over them any day!
5 I'm thoroughly impressed with Step Up Massage & Rehab. Making appointments is quick and easy through their website (like OpenTable but even easier). My wife and I have each had very good experiences with different providers at this clinic. Personally, I highly recommend Cassandra Kong (RMT). Cassandra seems to know exactly how much pressure to apply and exactly where to apply it.  *** UPDATE ***  I also highly recommend Dr. Gillian Huang's chiropractic treatment. She has successfully treated issues in both my neck and lower back.  Everyone at this clinic with whom I have dealt has gone above and beyond just the on-site treatment, by providing great advice on simple yet effective self-treatment between sessions.
1 Dr. Nicole Cain is unprofessional and unethical. I had a great first impression during our 15 minutes in the initial consultation. I scheduled the first appointment and paid the $100 deposit. Dr. Cain cancelled my appointment 15 minutes prior to the appointment (as per the instructions to show up 15 minutes early). I drove three hours for the appointment. I was disappointed but what was I supposed to do about the cancellation. I was already at the clinic. I was very sick and Dr. Cain was kind enough to call me in a prescription; however, could not reschedule me me in for 16 days. I asked if I should go to the emergency room or what exactly and the reply was, "Dr. Cain cannot respond because she needs to prioritize her appointments..." That was exactly what was said on my voicemail. Well thankfully I will not be seeing this doctor to treat my meningitis because who knows how long it will take for her to prioritize me into her schedule after she canceled on me. I reasonably asked for my deposit back. I did not fuss about anything. I was not rude. It was not refunded. This is absolutely unprofessional and I would reconsider becoming a patient with a doctor who practices with unethical values. If any patient gave her a 15 minute cancellation notice what would her policy be? I read it and I would be paying for it and apparently I am supposed to pay for her it when she cancels as well after my six hour round trip drive.
1 Now that it's called "the biltmore studio" I assume it's user new ownership. In the past, summits was held to strict protocol on yoga room regulations such as temperature and humidity percentage. Now it's noticeably different in that every time (without fail) the room is held at room temperature, in my opinion. The instructors I've attended all have opened the door excessively during class allowing the little hear in the room to escape. I'm so disappointed because I cannot find a challenging yoga studio in Arizona. I spend half my time in newport, where there are many to choose from studios that are much more updated and challenging. This studio could learn a lot from visiting a studio in SoCal as a good mentor.
5 This clinic is top notch.  I had a painful foot issue that required immediate attention, as I was traveling to the UK in the next couple of days.  If I didn't have it treated, I would be in trouble, whether I was at home or abroad.  I researched many foot doctors and decided on Academy based on reviews and the central Toronto location.  The clinic was amazing! Not only did they open an hour earlier for me on short notice (a client they had never met), Dr Hardy treated my foot perfectly.  Barely any pain and my foot healed much faster and better than expected.  Dr Marz and her husband are professional, warm and down to earth. The staff is friendly and the clinic is impeccably clean.  I definitely recommend Dr Marz Hardy for your foot care.  Five star care & service.
5 Due to pain in my lower back and a seemingly never ending quest for a beach body, I sought out some professional help. YSP came highly recommended to me, after all, they were voted best clinic for 2013 and after my first visit I can see why.   Upon my entry I immediately noticed how clean and organized the clinic was. It was welcoming and all the equipment looked well kept and of good quality. I met the clinic manager David Mowat who gave me a brief tour and made it a point to introduce me to all staff who were present. Everyone I met was courteous and cheerful.   I started with a 30 minute massage with RMT Florentin Racovitan. He is highly professional, patient and knowledgeable and took the time to assess where I was experiencing any discomfort. He also made some recommendations for footwear to reduce/eliminate my lower back and feet pain. Florentin practiced as a family physician prior to becoming a RMT and has advanced training and qualifications in several other areas of medicine, his experience goes way beyond that of an average RMT and that makes him invaluable. I genuinely anticipate our next session as after only 30 minutes earlier today I feel much better and make it a point to improve my posture.   Following my massage I met with Kinesiologist/Exercise Physiologist Marina Kaplan for a one hour active rehabilitation session. Similar to Florentin, Marina has a flurry of relevant qualifications, is passionate and knowledgeable in her field. Truth be told she Worked me and as I write this review I'm almost beginning to sweat - in a good way! I honestly can not wait for my next appt which I scheduled for this week. The sessions are customized to each individual but I do admire how they are core specific, and my cool down period involved electronic muscle stimulation, hot packs and a roll out.   As I mentioned above I already booked my next session and committed to 7 more before I take my holidays (aka binge eating sabbatical). For any individuals seeking rehabilitation, whether that be chiro, physio, an understanding of your body, overall sense of well being, exercise/fitness or all of the above, this is no doubt the place for you.
5 I have been going to performance physical therapy off and on now for 15 plus years for back issues and Danny and his staff have been excellent. They are consistence, caring and all well educated in physical therapy. I have gone to different PT offices in the past and there is none that compares to Performance Physical Therapy! Thank you Danny, Joel, Roxy, Lisa, Sam, Ashley, Kim and Kathy !
1 I have called this doctor several times over the last 5 years for an appointment because they were the only family doctor near my house.  They always offered visits at least 3-4 weeks out!  I need care now, when I'm sick, not next month.  I have finally found a new doctor in the neighborhood, Dr Runbeck, he's also called Laveen Country Doctor.  He is actually a naturopathic doctor and offers alternative natural treatments and regular prescriptions (if needed), which I like MUCH better.  He is such a nice doctor, I am so glad he has opened an office in our area!
1 I went to Physiotherapy Associates in 2010 for a sprained ankle. From the first day I came in, I was in the hands of students and not licensed physical therapists. The licensed PTs barely checked on me during each appointment.  Then, 9 months later they "changed their billing system" and I continue to receive bills for the visits that my insurance and I paid for. When I call to ask about it, I'm told "Well, it looks like we forgot to bill your insurance for some of the services rendered that day, so you're going to need to take care of the balance."   Don't go here unless you like paying premium price (and then some) to have PT students work on you.
1 From 5:21pm Sign In. 5:30 pm is appointment. I was out at 7:42pm. BS! Facility closes 7pm   I wrote a bad review here about my experience coming to this facility. After my post, someone called me from the facility and asked me to take down my bad review post.    If you do not like bad reviews , please acknowledge every patient in the building whether it is your patient or not! Even if you share a space. Acknowledge EVERY patient/client that comes in to the door and waiting.  The receptionist sitting in the front desk messed up big time!   I am not the only person who hates to wait for long hours. Its like you guys don't even care if other people have other appointments or business to attend to. All of the patients in there that day, Were all pissed off! They may not say it to you, but I have been observing them and they hate waiting for that long.   If I have a great experience here. I would give you 5 stars. But I didn't.   Hire more receptionist to make the appointments go faster and Better. Receptionist who said to sign my name. Must ask if patient have already filled out paperwork prior to seeing the doctor.   To make a facility be better, Help each other. Don't ignore patients.   Oh and one more thing. I am not the only person here who posted a bad review there are several other people who had bad reviews. I wonder if you called them too.   Yes I was upset I waited too long but it made me furious for someone to have the nerve to call me and say to take down my post. No one has ever done that. If you would like to say something. Send me a message, Do Not Ever Call Me Again because of a post!
1 I would give this location 4 stars for how Dr. Randall treated my husband the other day who was very sick, however, when I went in today with the exact same illness Dr. Richard was no help and provided no relief-- horrible doctor and does not listen. I'd recommend Dr. Randall but stay clear or Dr. Richard.
5 Being in a car accident doesn't just leave you with aches or pains, it takes away your peace at mind, Dr. Jazz and her team definitely gave that back to me! Not only was the therapy outstanding, the atmosphere is amazing. Her building is freshly remodeled and is super cute, showing me that she definitely takes pride in her work. If you have a question, they have an answer! Even when miscommunication arises, they always promptly give you their best foot forward. They can be busy, but I am always in and out within 30 minutes (they are pretty smooth sailing though!) And Even if you cannot make your appointment on time, just give them a call and they are always happy to reschedule you (offer same day as well). There has been several times where I went to her other office located in Glendale instead of the Phoenix location and had no problems at all. They also email you and text alert you two days before your appointment as a friendly reminder which is super useful as a college student. The girls there are so nice and relatable that the conversations will have you forgetting you are getting treatment. I swear you will think you guys are best friends LOL. With gentle hands and tender hearts, I totally recommend Dr. Jazz and her team because she truly cares for her patients. Especially if you are like myself who is young and has no idea what you are doing, you will always be comfortable, taken care of and pointed in the right direction!
5 Went here for a back injury. The staff at Kelly Hawkins have vastly improved my level of pain. The doctors and assistants here are incredibly knowledgeable and caring. Every time I went in I was greeted by name by all of the staff and they always remembered and asked about my personal life. My doctor, Lawrence, was incredible working with many different techniques to help relieve my pain. The facility is clean and the environment is comfortable and relaxed.  Very happy with my experience at Kelly Hawkins and would recommend it to anyone I know.
1 My first visit was a mess. I was scheduled for an exam for something I did not need. After waiting an hour, they finally figured out I just needed an annual check up. Fast forward 3 days. I got a call Friday afternoon stating the Dr. wanted to see me for test results. They made an appointment for Thursday at 845. Here is is Thursday and they say I have no appointment. So they stick me in a room now 9:40 and still no Dr. No apologies for screwing up. Just shut up, sit and wait. This will be my VERY last visit! These people must be affiliated with the VA!!!
5 I had my first visit today and it went great. Staff is on top of everything and the visit was easy. Katie Jacobs was awesome and very thorough. I feel very happy with this office and am willing to travel a bit to go to it. I was so happy at the end of the visit and felt all of the issues I had were addressed wonderfully.
5 I've been going to A Las Vegas Medical Group since 2013. I will always remember my first visit and how welcomed I felt. I brought my newborn to Dr. Allen and there was an immediate bond. My kids love him and the staff! Dr. Allen always gives us his undivided attention and I never feel rushed. He is like family!!   Dr. Hieu is my new hero and I LOVE her!!! She's always so attentive and makes me feel comfortable. She listens to everything I have say and I can tell she loves her career and is passionate about health. My kids have seen her too and I love the way she takes care of them too. She's so loving and caring of her patience. I hope she never leaves!   Nicole and her staff; Anna, Wendy, and Jesus are amazing!! They're always attentive to my needs and most of the time they're able to give me same day appointments. As needy as my family is I've never felt like a nuisance and I know I can be. Anna has been the one to always help me with referrals and is always on top of her game.     Sure, there have been changes in staff but the change has always been for the better. There was a Dr there once who was not nice at all and always felt bothered and rude, I'm glad he is gone (Dr I.) There are new Dr's there now and all seem super sweet and nice. I haven't had the pleasure of seeing them yet but I know I will if Dr. Hieu and Dr. Allen aren't available.  All in all I do recommend this medical office. They are caring and except almost all insurances. (I've been through a couple) Anyway, good job A Las Vegas Medical (2 thumbs up).....seeee you sooon!!! lol
5 Really great physiotherapist - in two months she helped me go from constant pain in several places to a huge reduction and some pain-free days.
1 Worst dentist experience.  Ever.  Daughter getting wisdom teeth out. "Sedation" is a pill, not sedation!!! Wanted to stop procedure but Yita the "office manager" said NO REFUND.  I paid $1400.  Dr. Paik has no bedside manner.  You are having pain?  Pain is all in your mind!!! he says.  Leaves the room.  Won't talk to you. Say's tell me when you are ready   They kicked me out of treatment room after daughter had a panic attack.   From pain.  The good reviews are ALL one review people.  FAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I feel so bad I took my daughter here.  Run.  Don't walk.
5 I originally started seeing Dr Legg before he came to this clinic.. and loved him so much that I still travel to see him!  The staff at this clinic is so welcoming and Dr Legg always takes the time to listen, explain and ensure your adjustment is just right!
5 Super friendly staff will have you fixed in no time! My girlfriend had been hounding me for months to schedule an appointment before final scheduling for me. I am so glad she took the initiative! Now I have a standing appointment to correct my issue tebbbg
1 First time here as we recently moved to Arizona.  Sitting in room now waiting for doctor.  We have been here for 3 hrs now-ridiculous!!
5 This treatment was exceptional - and as a person who has experimented with many different forms of body work, that's saying something! I really appreciated Rotem's kind approach and I trusted him to support my body. Without trusting that you are supported, you can't let go and simply enjoy being moved with ease and grace. I would highly recommend trying this experience!
1 First of all, I rarely write reviews. It is only when I am pressed to a point of being completely in love or completely annoyed that I decide to review a place. This brings me to the Toronto Travel Clinic.   I received vaccines from them about a year ago. Everything went fine for sure. I did experience the same "upselling" the other reviewer mentioned. The gentleman who runs the business spends a lot of time filling your head with every single possible infection you could get in the countries that you'll be traveling to. I travel A LOT....been to over 30 countries in the last ten years. It seemed to me that the specialist (if you can call him that) had never even made it over the border. I managed to leave with just what I wanted....my friends (who have never been to Asia before) were scared into getting a lot more than needed (and paying handsomely for it).  Now that was a year ago. Why I write now is because I needed to get a record of my immunizations from them recently, and so it meant dealing with them again. I have emailed asking for my record. Waited. Waited. Got a response but record. Then I called. Was kept on hold for 15mins. Hung up. Called again. On hold again. Hung up. Before they put me on hold, I tried to stop them but the girl did not even bother to see who it was and just put me on hold. Finally, after calling back three more times, some answers....of course she is rude and has an attitude. You would think after having explained that I had been on hold for so long, you'd get a little more understanding! Nope.  I don't know if there are other places to get vaccinated in Toronto, but trust me, go somewhere else. Unprofessional, inconsiderate, and complete salesmen in the worst way.
5 I ruptured my Achilles tendon in late 2012, and required about 6-12 months of physical therapy. Synergy's clinic on Horizon Ridge and Valle Verde was close to home, and got great reviews on yelp, so I gave it a shot.   Let me tell you, I've made a few poor choices in life; this was not one of them. Nicole and her staff are friendly, caring, generous with their time, and get results. The staff is dedicated to making you better and restoring your function and well being. Scheduling was a breeze, and they are flexible with their schedule. Unlike many medical offices in the Valley, the front office staff here is quick, personal, and friendly. Even when busy, the staff is efficient but friendly. I've never gone to a physical therapy clinic that felt more familial.   The clinic is clean, and the staff takes good care to wipe down and sanitize the machines, and generally keep the place tidy. There's also some specialized equipment, like the Vertimax, for training explosiveness and vertical. Even the small details, like hand towel service for sweat, and clean bathrooms are not overlooked.   After my insurance cut me off after about 7 months, Synergy put me on a fitness program, which was a godsend. For $50 a month, I could continue to go to the clinic and work on my regiment. After 18 months, my ankle was finally feeling mostly normal, but I still go for fitness; it's way cheaper than personal training, and a good supplement for other workouts. Thanks, Synergy, for getting me back on my feet!
1 Worst experience ( in my opinion ) ever! I use to go for regular massages when I lived in Windsor, but recently moved to this area and was hoping to find a new place to go to frequently. Some people at my work gave me some recommendations of places but I thought I'd try out: Just Relax through Groupon because the offer was a 90-Minute Full Body Massage or 60-Minute Hot Stone Massage for $40.00! Good deal I thought! - BUT Its been nothing but a headache. I booked online on April 3rd for an APPOINTMENT April 11th was very excited to go... told everyone....SOOOOOOO.... IT GETS CANCELLED just days before...VIA EMAIL!! No courtesy phone call to reschedule...NOTHING!!! . It took me multiple phone calls, emails, and fb messages to get a hold of someone to reschedule. ONLY TO BE TOLD ( via fb message) to book online again with a different person because the person I clicked on through booking doesn't do that groupon. I had since taken that day off work and was not impressed with the way things were handled. I cooled off for a bit. A couple days ago I try to rebook, clicking on a different person- only to get an email today saying I booked two back to back groupon massages. NO I didn't!!! I have just attempted to schedule appointments and have been taken for a ride by this company. I am officially DONE! congrats you just got $40 for free from me... good scam if you ask me. I will never...ever purchase anything from this company and I will make sure to let others know aswell. EXTREAMLY DISSAPOINTED
5 Where can I start in reviewing Wonderful Smiles Dental! With the staff first, they are amazing!!! They remembered who I was as I walked into the office, that made me feel real special! They put your comfort first and reassure you that everything will be fine. Especially cuz I was going in for a extraction! My dentist was Dr. Brett Davis and he was awesome!!! His work on me was the best I've ever had!! I didn't feel a thing at all! Through the shot from the anesthesia, from pulling my tooth til the end, he made me feel at ease throught the whole process. I was in and out of there in an hour! On top of that, they followed up with me 3 days after my procedure was done to make sure I wasn't having any problems. And I thought that was beyond anything that any dental or medical office has done and really really making they're patients feel like they are someone. I will definitely refer eneryone to this office and will always have them as the office I go too!
5 Dr. Wade has been our primary care doctor for the past 11 years! He is caring, patient and very thorough. He calls "himself" to report on labs. Who takes the time to do that these days? His staff is awesome, particularly Cindy and LaShonda!!!
5 These therapist really know how to give a great massage specially for me!  I have visited many and I would rate them the best!  Thanks for making me feel Great!
5 This office offered excellent service! The receptionist was very helpful. The doctor was very friendly and patient; she was very compassionate. The price was affordable. I would definitely return to this office, and would recommend this location to my friends and family.
5 Dr. George does ART and chiro techniques to rehabilitate. He has worked with athletes from the San Francisco 49ers and US Swim Team.  I've been a patient for various issues but most recently for a sports injury and didn't hesitate knowing I am at the right place to rehabilitate my foot. Pat is also an excellent Physio therapist, who gives you the knowledge and exercises to prevent injuries.  If you have a sports injury, this is the place to be!!
2 I waited to write a review because i waited to have a couple more treatments done with Jolli and at another facility.   I went to Jolli about a year ago. I had been hassling my significant other to have a colonic done, but i hadn't.  He had an open system colonic and i was more interested in trying the closed system. With the closed system, the tech can really get throughout your system. I discovered Jolli through a Groupon.  She is literally 5 mins from my home. She is a very nice lady, but can be a bit unprofessional.  In my experience,  she didnt give useful information about the procedure.  She spoke more about other clients, her personal life, etc. I didn't get a chance to relax and get the most out of the session.  In doing a bit of research prior to visiting Jolli, it is better to have your 1st series of treatments in a 7 day span (3-4). Jolli spaced my 3 treatments over a 3-3.5 week time frame.  I didn't have much of a result. Jolli regulates the water pressure and she tells you to say when the pressure is too much so she can release. In speaking with other persons that have more experience with colon hydrotherapy, that is uncommon.  The techs control the water pressure and based on your body and pressure, they release the pressure themselves.   Overall, I won't have anymore sessiins with Jolli. I wish her succes with her business, but i received better results and more informative information from another facility.
5 They just completed some rennovations -- just as my script expired!  Boo hoo!  All the staff are great, they remember your name and are good at relaxing but relevant small talk while they treat your ailments. They are all charming and have great humor. They all have good vibes amongst themselves (no tension among workers).  This is a special group of hardworking and hip dudes and dudettes.  They know their field and are patient, helpful and attentive.
5 I've been back a few times now and I really like Dr. Paul and his staff.  They are top notch heath care providers and they are real people who know how to balance health care with your busy life.  Entire office has a GREAT sense of humor too!
1 They only get one star because I have to give them something. Dr Herring is nice enough. The rest of the staff are rude and don't understand the meaning of customer service. We had a multitude of billing issues here, never once able to resolve then. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. While the doctor is fine, it isn't worth dealing with the rest of the staff.
5 My best friend used to volunteer at Altima Wellness Centre with Dr. Negin for quite some time and would not stop raving about the staff and their services. Needless to say she was absolutely right! Dr. Negin and her staff are nothing but professional, knowledgeable and kind, and make sure you understand exactly what you are getting and believe me, it's worth what you pay for! I have already recommended them to my family and friends and I know that they are recommending it to others as well. I hope to continue to do business for them for a long time coming! :) Keep up the great work!
5 I went in to the community clinic because it was close to my house and I could not be happier with Dr. Moody and the Staff. The office is small and has an informal vibe. However the care is amazing, Dr. Moody accepts walk in's and saw me the same day I called and I did not have to sit in a waiting room for hours, which means a lot to me seeing how I have a busy schedule with my family and my job. I now go to Dr. Moody to get vitamin injections which have personally helped me lose weight and have more energy. Thanks for everything Dr. Moody.
5 This was my first experience with a chiropractor, but I cannot imagine having a more positive experience anywhere else. The staff of this office are very friendly, professional, and compassionate. Dr. Koch is a very knowledgable practitioner, and genuinely passionate about helping people feel and function their best, which I think is very unique.   The first appointment I received a welcome bag with nice gel ice pack, lots of information about chiropractic adjustments to put you at ease. I genuinely felt at ease in this environment, and each adjustment helped me immensely after my motor vehicle accident. Lots of good advice for strengthening at home, almost like seeing a physical therapist, pain management, and chiropractic office in one. Always willing to fit you in if you are in pain, later hours for those of us who work 8-5pm. Great place!
5 Alex Delgado is a highly competent, well trained, and friendly person. He is recognized as "One of the Best" here in the area. The staff at Comprehensive Therapy Centers are well trained, efficient, and friendly. I have been treated by Alex for many years. He has returned me to health from such problems as broken ankles, a fractured pelvis, and a smashed femur. Most of these required emergency surgery and then long periods of healing with therapy to strengthen muscle and heal bone so that I am able to walk again. For any "Local" if you need Physical Therapy ask your Physician send you to Alex Delgado.
4 My parent is currently receiving care here and I am posting this review to assure those looking for a rehab facility that this is a good place to go to in my opinion. I am posting four stars only because his stay is not finished. He has been here about 10 days and I have been at his bedside daily to observe. This is a clean and modern building. Most of the staff is friendly and everyone is pleasant and helpful. The facility seems to be well run and well organized. The hallways are full of patients exercising in and behind their wheelchairs. I have observed the friendly exchanges between other patients and staff. I wouldn't hesitate to bring him back here again based on the care so far. The food looks okay and is varied but bringing something from home is always going to be better. As with any medical stay, the patient always gets better care if there is a family member there on a regular basis to be an advocate.
1 Unnecessary wait time. The doors where locked during business hours. Dirty facility. The nurse even said so. However I did like.Tracy at the front desk. He got the door open and was the most efficient at his job. Thanks Tracy!
5 Brian and Holly are great. I found this place after my surgery on my knee on yelp. This is the first time I have ever done physical therapy. Brian is very knowledgeable and helpful throughout the entire process. They are both very welcoming to help and push you to get better during your rehab. I have recommended Desert Sun to all my friends.
5 I was surprised how well the staff worked.  Defiantly didn't feel like it was a "Mill". Friendly and pretty swift and efficient practice. I am very very very happy. My feet and Ankle feel allot better.
2 If you enjoy waiting for over an hour for treatment, then this is the place for you. Even the receptionist does ultrasound when it is busy. I had to pay a $60 fee for an "assessment" for an overuse injury and the woman barely touched me and made a pronouncement of injury. It was the injury I had already been treating and been diagnosed previously. Her attitude was one of complete disinterest. There are a couple of other physios there who are completely over worked and treating 6 people at once. One other thing is the receptionist very loudly discusses your financial coverage and other private info in front of other patients. The view out the windows is great....that's all....
5 Great care and treatment. Very personal and caring. The team makes recovery not only bare able but enjoyable. Thank you!
5 Constantine George and the entire staff at this office are wonderful. Everyone is caring and both Doctor George and Doctor Parker actually invest quality time talking with you and answering any questions you might have. I have never felt rushed during any visit or when they are extremely busy.   This team should be extremely proud of the care and service they provide.
5 Great staff, service and hours. It's not far from my house or work. Very convenience!
5 Amazing team at Camelback Sports Therapy, I was referred by Dr. Laura Henson from Mountain View Family Physicians for Achilles Tendonitis. Hailey at CPT has guided and treated my recovery and therapy. When I came in it was painful to walk for any distance... Now i can walk with little pain and have a greater range of motion. She did this with physical therapy exercises, dry needling, massage, ultra sound and kinetic taping. Thank you Hailey and team CPT!
1 The Worst experience with a doctors office I have ever had.  When I walked in as a new patient I was handed a clipboard with 12 pages to fill out filling out,  your name 12 times, date etc 12 times There was 27 people waiting, After I completed the book of information the waiting room was cleared out then another 16 people arrived one after another this was now 1 hour after I arrived, they were all called except for me. I went to the window told them I am done give me back all my paper work. 2 hours wasted of my life. They have patient files all over the reception area floor, looks like a cross between a clinic & a bus station. Run as fast as you can from this practice.
1 My 1 1/2 year old son, Lorenzo, was in the Freemont office on Durango to see Dr. Shi yesterday and today. Dr. Shi is relatively new to this practice after replacing Dr. McGhee. Now I know why the consummate caring Dr. McGhee left the Freemont group.    Tonight at 8pm, I called and spoke with the after hours service. I asked Maria that the Dr. on call to please give me a call as my son was continuing with the symptoms that he had earlier that day when we were in the office just 4 hour earlier.   Maria spoke to Dr. Schnitzler who was on call that evening. Maria spoke with Dr. Schnitzler, who refused to speak with me or call me!  That is a serious issue with me and one that I will be pursuing with the state board.  I will be leaving this practice as the culture and caring quotient has certainly changed.  This is the profession that he chose, I really don't care if my son had a sneeze or the 104 temperature that he had, he should speak with the patient.
1 When I say The Worst, I mean The Worst..... This office is not professional at all. After being seen at the office my first time I was suppose to receive several referrals. Well as the week went by I tried contacting them on several occasions during the day and the calls were going directly to the after hours answering service. And it was nowhere near lunch time. If at all possible and you have other choices please think twice before using this place. The don't seem to take patient's health serious.
4 I used to do this kind of yoga weekly when I lived in Flagstaff, and the best part was at the end of the 90 minute, 110 degree class is you got to go outside in the cool air afterward. Not in Phoenix, no sir, you get done with the class and go outside where it's nice and hot and then get in your even hotter car. Damn.   But this is just me complaining about the unbearable heat, again. The class was awesome. The instructor was friendly and thorough and pretty much remembered everyones names.   Be sure if you go to bring a yoga mat, 2 towels, one small one to wipe the dripping sweat off your brow and one to set over your mat so you don't slip on your sweaty mat. Water, it's hot in there. I recommend putting ice in your water too, a little treat.   They also had an August first-timer special for a two week unlimited pass it's $25, which is great. I got sick for a week, so only went to two classes. Sucks because after these two weeks, I don't think I'll be able to afford to go anymore, we'll see. It's like $375 for a three month pass and $16 to drop-in, a little pricey for me. That must not be the case for everyone else though, the classes I went to were pretty crowded.
1 DO NOT USE THIS DOCTOR.  Dr. DeRosa's billing practices are wrong.  My wife went to see her for a well visit, which is covered without co-pay by my insurance.  DeRosa mis-coded the visit in order to collect additional fees from us and maybe the insurance company.  When confronted, they told us they would refund the co-pay and after repeated requests, refused to send the refund.  STAY CLEAR OF THIS PRACTICE.
4 My mother was recently at this facility for therapy after having her lower leg amputated.  I must say that for a skilled nursing facility, this place was one of the best I've seen.  The staff was attentive and very friendly.  All the rooms are private suites - unlike many facilities where you have to share a room.  Nice location too.  Advanced Health Care really emphasizes physical and occupational therapy sessions - even after the patient is released.  My only concern was the food services - they had tasty meal selections, but not very healthy many times.  Most patients here are senior citizens who should be eating healthy meals - not high-sodium, fried, or fattening foods.  Other than that, I'm impressed.  This comes from someone who is highly critical of many nursing facilities because of their LACK of good care, but Advanced Health Care demonstrated their professionalism and caring attitudes toward their patients.
4 I took in the 11:30am yoga class today.  It was pretty good.  The room was not as warm as usual - and I'm totally thankful b/c it's been a few months since I've practiced.  The teacher was good, the class was challenging, and had enough of the stuff everyone is used to, to keep it from being too intimidating.  Definitely a neighbourhood gem!
1 I see Dr Gorman here but not anymore. His staff is horrible. I had an appt in July but they decided to close for a meeting and forgot to tell me! I showed up to a closed, dark office. I called to ask what was up & the lady was like, "oh, you are right, you do have an appt but we forgot to call you and change it, oops!" And she giggled! Unacceptable! And u can't get an appt here for months out!  I finally called and got one recently - December! I was told I could be put on a cancellation list, if one came sooner they'd bump me up. Well, one did. Gormans asst Diana called me and said they'd see me next day. We had a lengthy conversation about it and I even repeated the time and day back to her, had her repeat it back to me! But when I went the next day, she denied our call even took place! She was not only rude, but tried to say it must've been one of my other docs. I tried to show her in my phone but she refused to look. She could have at least apologize but no - just very rude and unprofessional. No care for the patient at ALL. Diana is awful! Don't go here!
5 After my back went out I chose this business because of other reviews on Yelp and it was close to my home. I was able to get in the same day I called which was amazing as I was really hurting. The staff was friendly when I called and during the check in/new patient process. I really like that they use text reminders and seem up to date technology wise.   The Dr. evaluated my needs and was caring and professional. After my first initial adjustment I felt worlds better! It was nice to hear that my action plan for rehabilitation was no more than 6-8 visits total. As we progressed I visited around 7 or 8 times and feel much better. I would recommend this as a great place for adjustments. Excellent people and business!
1 Nice facility but the doctor that I saw gave the most cursory 'physical' that I have ever received, and then tried to convince me that Ambien is a safe sleep aid. Never going back.
1 Made an appointment for a vaccination shot. Waited over an hour just to see the PA. They have no respect for your time.
5 Only one thing to say: AAHHHHHHH! Ivy was incredible. I'll be going here on a very regular basis. You should too.
1 This place is NOT a Dr's office! This place is a fucking joke! Dr. Adrian Pinzon ... i can't believe you are even an MD and I'll be submitting a formal complaint against you. I came here seeking a medical professional and got an appointment with Dr. Adrian only to get somebody who had prejudice against me, and sat there smirking at me when I was in an accident earlier that day completely denying me of having any pain even when I told him I still suffer from pain when I was in another accident and suffered from a paralyzed face for half a year ago too. I've never been to a doctors office and been told that I need to workout the muscles where my injury is to heal. Only an asshole who wants to go home because it's close to closing says that! This guy didn't even give me any ibuprofen or anything! These people clearly are just "there to be there" and not there to do their jobs.. just trying to collect their paychecks. I wouldn't recommend this office for your kids, your wife or anybody who you love. Somebody you care about deserves the extra few $$ spent on a REAL DR OFFICE! And to you Dr. Adrian Pinzon.... GO BACK TO SCHOOL YOU UNPROFESSIONAL PRICK! YOU TOOK AN OATH AS A DOCTOR AND YOU DONT DESERVE TO CALL YOURSELF A DOCTOR. YOU ARE A FRAUD!
3 I had written an email of the experience I had on my 3rd visit and suprising, they actually cared and replied so for that I can up my review to 3 stars.    Any company that is willing to listen and attempt to better themselves deserves another chance.  I will call and make a monthly appointment again that I had cancelled and will update my review after ~
1 The staff deserves better--they are great!  Dr. Ehren is NOT interested in caring for patients, he is only in this for the money.  I would absolutely look elsewhere if you are in need of true, hands-on care by someone who DOES care.
5 I really enjoy going to the Gilbert location of Function Pilates. I have never done this before and the instructor was patient and extremely helpful in making me feel comfortable and guiding me through the lesson. It's a wonderful environment. Only three clients at a time take the class so there is plenty of individual attention. This is a full body workout that didn't leave my joints in pain. I highly recommend this!
5 Dr. Mitch is extremely personable and professional when address your health and treatment. The facility has an amazingly friendly staff and Candice's massages are the best I've had! How can you not check them out when they are currently offering free x-ray, consult & massage? Your body will be grateful, trust me!
1 Charlie is a nice doc. But last time I went here, they sent me to collections due my insurance denying their claim when they failed to provide additional information. No one ever contacted me for more information. Do NOT come here.
1 My friend had to go to the ER on a Thursday night. The place is very run down and the sheets were stained. They messed up his IV dropped his blood samples and his morphine!   If it's not an emergency go somewhere else
2 In a pinch I had to go back here.  It's still got low stars bc of my previous experience but the plus is the staff is great.  I still didn't really like the Dr.  He was fine with the simple things but when I asked him about something more complex he just brushed it off with a "Well we'll have to keep an eye on it".  He didn't even check out what I was telling him about.  The on site pharmacy is a save but I think they charge $15 on everything.  So one prescription I had was 9 pills and I essentially paid $1.50 per pill.  Overpriced much?!  Better than last visit though for sure.     ..... Just don't go there.  I went in because my toddler had been bit by something and had a weird scaly hardened area that had fang marks and was weeping.  It was so gross and so sad and was progressively getting worse.  It was late at night and bothering her so I decided to take her in.  The thing is that I called FIRST which is part of my annoyance.  I specifically asked if they knew anything about spider bites and was told yes.  So I went in.  The nurse was ok but swore like a sailor which only bothered me bc my toddler was in the room.  The Dr. was a joke.  He walked in and just started talking, no hello or anything.  After checking her leg and not asking me even one question he started writing out a couple prescriptions and told me I could pick them up there (I felt like he was just trying to sell prescriptions).  Right before he was going to walk out of the room I interrupted him (bc he literally hadn't stopped speaking for one second) and asked him WHAT it was, and if he thought it was a spider bite.  He said "I don't know what it is.  I don't care what it is.  All I care about is what it looks like.  It doesn't matter what it is".  My mouth dropped.  I was like "I think it matters!".  Anyway so he ended up sending me home with two Staph infection Rx.  A few days later after zero improvement on her leg I took her to my regular pediatrician who was so upset by my story she wanted me to call and get the Dr. in trouble which I thought was surprising.  She told me it WAS a bite, and gave me a different Rx for an allergic reaction which did the trick.  My daughter now has a scar from the bite which I wonder if would be there at all if it wasn't for that Dr's negligence and lack of knowledge.
5 This place is awesome!! I felt so cared for and well taken care of. Mrs. LaMendola is the best very knowledgeable she listened to me and answered all my questions; also her assistant is awesome very upbeat and friendly.
5 Great staff!! Everyone is super friendly including Dr. Genet and Dr. Amoia. They are all wondeful and will do everything they can to accomodate your needs!!
5 Dr. Marshall is so professional and truly cares about his clients. First he does an assessment to see your problem areas and from there on chooses what type of treatment is best for you. After 30 days he does another assessment to see how well you have recovered. I have been coming here for a few months now and I feel like I've made the right decision by choosing him to be my chiropractor for the rest of my life. I would definitely recommend him to anyone and everyone looking for an adjustment, massage or physical therapy!
5 Hands down the best massage I've ever had. Matthew clearly is passionate about the human body - he gives a very thorough pre-massage intake interview, and lots of tips for preventative and maintenance work you can be doing for your body. I'm only sad I wasn't able to get in for a two hour session - will absolutely book in advance next time, as his schedule was completely full.
3 Can't really write much of a review....I arrived 5 minutes late so they wouldn't see me!  I had booked an appointment a few weeks in advance for niggling foot pain.   The earliest appointment was 2 weeks after I emailed but my problem wasn't urgent so that didn't bother me.  The pleasant woman I emailed said the appointment would last 15-30mins and was covered by OHIP.  Sounded good!  The appointment was a work day. It was "one of those days" and I left work later than expected for the appointment.  Got there as quickly as possible (after swirling around wildly in 11 King West and being directed downstairs) and apologised at the desk.  The receptionist said she'd ask the doctor if he'd still see me.  She came back a moment later and said no.  He had appointments every 10mins so I'd have to be rescheduled.  Next appointment another 3 weeks away.  I didn't bother.  I understand that I was late.  That's my fault.  I'd hate somebody else to be delayed because of that.  I also understand that the healthcare system is overloaded.  However, I think 10 minutes for a first appointment is inappropriate.  I simply don't think it's enough time to take a full history and perform a detailed examination.  Great sports physicians will want to know history, hear about activites and get some idea of your biomechanics as well as just looking at the sore spot.  Review appointment?  10 mins is plenty.  But new patients deserve longer.  There are physiotherapists etc in the clinic too, so maybe you'd have better luck just heading to them.  Or arrive early and know what's wrong with you already.
5 Richard Sedillo is by far the BEST physical therapist I have seen in over 25 years. As an athlete, I have had many injuries and worked with lots of folks in PT to heal.  This is the first time I've worked with someone who truly goes above and beyond to help you understand what's wrong, explains what the causes are given his deep understanding of the body and walks through next steps.  I admire his dedication and passion for solving these individual puzzles with each of his patients and work tirelessly to get them back to health.  I came to Richard almost a year ago after living with 5 years of pain from my shoulder.  I'm almost 100% and forever indebted to him for all his help. He continues to be my "go to" for when I encounter pain and we work through a plan. Go see him as it will be the best investment you make in staying healthy and mobile. I promise!
5 I was very pleased with the care I received.  The staff is knowledgeable,  caring and fun! I would not hesitate to use them again if needed.  But I'm hoping I don't need them again soon.
5 My experience with Blankinship was excellent.  The staff was very knowledgeable and always on top of things.  They were aware of all of the patience around them and when they were done with their exercises and needed to move on to the next.  If the therapist that you were working with was busy, another one would step in and take over.  They are very professional, courteous, knowledgeable and responsive.  I highly recommend them!
1 I visited the office for a woman's wellness exam, while the doctor was on time and appointment was smooth the staff along with the doctor were very rude, I got left in the exam room after appointment didn't know where to check out. And when I did go to checkout the office clerk was unprofessional as well, eatting carrying on personal conversations . Seems to me I came at the wrong time, during lunch seems like no one cared about what was going on. Very unprofessional and rude I won't be coming back to that mess.
1 My wife went to Dr. Bader for the first time. We were alittle late and were chastised by three different people including Dr. Bader. She had not been to a doctor for some time and is a cancer surviver. When asked why she was there she explained that she wanted a blood workup. She was told there was no time to do that and continued on her computer checking boxes. She sat alone for eight to ten minutes, plenty of time to draw blood. She had never seen this doctor before and a blood workup l think would be imperative to properly treat some one. I want my wife to have a doctot who is concerned about her patients and not so much about the bookkeeping. She got paid for doing nothing.
2 I was very pleased with Dr Michael Brown, however, not pleased enough to put up with the awful phone, scheduling, and response from the office staff. I called for a refill of a common medicine for which I had already completed blood work. They said that they would call me when the prescription was ready to pick up. 4 days later (they require 72 hours to write a simple non-narcotic prescription) when I called, they had no record of my request and told me it would be 72 hours. I am now out of the medicine. I calmly complained about my 40 minute phone hold time.  When without regard to my medical condition told me that it would be 72 hours before I would hear from them, I said, "OK now I am upset and I am directing it at you." With no regard for my medical condition, she said she was ending the call and hung up on me. Shopping for a new option.
5 I love TEAM 4 Kids! The staff is absolutely amazing and my son has made definite progress. He is never scared to go back and work with his therapists and I can honestly say that we feel welcome and cared about here. I am so happy that we found TEAM 4 Kids and I recommend TEAM 4 Kids to anyone who is in need of services for their children.
5 Dr. Rosenstein is a great and personable physician. He always takes time with me, I never feel rushed. Its always easy to get in with him for an appointment, usually within 2 days. I would recommend this practice and Dr. Rosenstein to anyone!
5 I wasn't sure if I'd like Pilates on the reformer so I purchased a 5 class package. After my third class, I can definitely say I'm hooked. My second class w Luanne and my third class w May were both phenomenal. They spend so much time with you on an individual basis and address all your concerns. In fact Luanne pointed out something in my posture that explained all the hip, knee problems I have had for years. She gave me exercises/stretches to do at home to help correct my posture. It's different than any other work out (and I do them all: hot yoga, spin, boot camp, run, barre). It's a deeper strength and already I can feel a difference in my spine. Less strain and pain (when I didn't even know I had any. I just figured it was normal to feel that way). Thanks Function Egoscue!! Looking forward to continuing on my journey to getting even healthier, lean muscle, correct posture and less hip/knee pain.
4 The Bellevue Medical is a centrally located and the Doctors & Nurses are helpful efficient and expert.  I have mostly been treated by Dr Donna and Dr Tolley. They really take their time and listen to what you have to say.  A great medical centre - they take repeat prescriptions by email as well!
5 A friend recommended Woolston Wellness  to me after I had been dealing with years of post accident injuries and pain. I had tried everything from physical therapy to Acupuncture. I finally decided to give Woolston Wellness a try. It didn't happen overnight, but I feel better now than I have in the last four years. The staff(Daphne) is awesome, and they are very flexible and easy to get into. Dr. Jeff is very compassionate and truly truly wants to help and keep you healthy for life!
1 If i could give negative stars, i would.  After my car accident, i was sent to Doctor Silver by Ed Bernsteins office.  The physical therapist is rude and hurt me the first time. Didnt even read notes saying what I could and could not tolerate in regards to therapy.   Doctor Silver was very nice and pleasant, but all he did was give me narcotics and charged a ton for them.  My son, who was in the accident with me, had the same experience.  Aweful center all together, from reception to doctors.
5 Dr Victoria Ho really helped my retired father's bad back. He went to a few places but he finally found a place that helped him. Dr Ho (no relation to THE Dr Ho lol) spoke fluent Cantonese for my father and English for me. She was really attentive and caring. Highly recommended.
4 Dr. McAlister has been great, and informative. Very positive attitude. It is great that they have in-house physical therapy as well
5 By far one of the best businesses I've reviewed on Yelp. I had my name on a wait list here, and after being told it was almost a year out, I still waited. When I heard from them months earlier than expected, I was excited about starting.  Coming from another daycare which I thought wasn't bad, it was a night and day difference. The infant room is intimate, and ms Tiffany and ms Crystal go above and beyond entertaining, rocking, and taking great care of our lil one. What sets seek apart from other daycares is their attention to learning. The ladies help develop his skills, not just set them down and let him cry or numb out on the ground. They give us reports of crafts they did, music activities, and what their overall disposition was that day. The toys they have for the babies are interactive with lights and the alphabet and wonderful colors. I could go on and on about all the amazing things this place has to offer, but it'd be an essay. Check it out, and put your name on the wait list ASAP!
5 Hello Jasmin goodbye knots! Got a massage here thru a Groupon. Which had me slightly concerned since well how good can a two hour massage for 70 bucks be?! Well it was fanfriggintastic. She actually spent the entire two hours rubbing out my knots as if they had personally insulted her.   I will be going back and you should check it out as well.
5 I have been going to Dr. Daliah for 10 years now. I love her! I've never had a problem with the staff or scheduling. Its a doctors office, you go in and have to wait a bit, you never know what is going on behind the scenes or what kind of issues have come up with previous patients. People need to learn some patience in waiting rooms. Dr. Daliah is a great doctor who tells it like it is and never has a problem with getting me a referral or medication, if needed. She listens well and has always been super helpful! I will keep going here for years to come!
5 I call Dr Paige "the Kid Whisperer".  My son and every child I know LOVES him.  He also happens to be an excellent chiropractor for children and adults.  Both his demeanor and adjustments are gentle and we look forward to our appointments.
1 I used to love this practice because of Dr. Inocencio.  I'm sorry to give it a one star, but the service here is so horrible, I can't get past it.   Sorry Doc - your staff does you a disservice.  I have tried to get an appointment for a follow up to my surgery for over a month now - they simply do not answer the phone and have NEVER called me back in spite of my multiple messages requesting an appointment.  I wonder if the place is still open?  Anyway, I tap - though I prefer Dr. Inocencio, I am forced to find another provider because these people clearly do not have the ability to provide the care needed.  I recommended him to several friends, who have also received no response from this facility.  Too bad.
5 I have just finished three months of rehab for post op shoulder surgery with Lauren.  Lauren was exceptional from Day One up until my last appointment.  The progress of rehab was on a schedule with Lauren working with you throughout and ensuring you were taken care of while meeting protocol goals.  I also worked with Chris who was outstanding as well.  The Officer Manager Lori was cordial and professional when assisting me in making my weekly appointments. I highly recommend ATR. Outstanding atmosphere!  Greatly appreciate the effort, Thank you!!
5 Yelp reviewers didn't let me down. Trying to find a good doctor in NV is like finding a needle in a haystack. Luckily, I found this practice because of Yelp's reviews.   Dr . Sabih just "got me" from the instant she walked in. First visit and I was relieved of the stress of finding a competent doctor.   Cons: I waited a couple of hours before seeing the doctor. Being a new patient I wondered if this was typical but was assured by other waiting patients it was a crazy day.
1 Zero stars, called and cancelled my appointment, was told I had a zero balance on my account. Never received an invoice. When I went to buy my house found out I had a bill from them in collections for a no call no show on the appointment I had cancelled. Called the office to clear it up, they gave me the run around did not try to correct the error and no one ever called me back from the "billing department." Worst front office staff.
5 Cryo is literally the coolest thing in Pittsburgh and this is the place to do it - at half the price they charge in NYC. My GF goes at least once a w=k and can't get enough of it.
5 Dr Chris and his staff provide exceptional customer care...our entire family trusts him and values his time and advice. He truly cares for his patients...He will never rush through his patients-he will spend as much time with you as you need. Definitely go visit Dr Chris you will be pleased!!
5 Tammy is awesome! My wife is pregnant with twins in a high risk pregnancy and we wanted to get her some professional relief with massage therapy. Apparently Tammy is one of the only (if not THE only) massage therapists in the Phoenix area with a Prenatal massage certification. She is thorough and makes sure that your doctor approves of the massages and lets her know of any restrictions. She was a pleasure to work with and a great masseuse!
1 I went to this location for about 3 months after leaving the Paradise Valley location. I signed up for their wellness at Paradise Valley , and I was assured that you could use it at any location. I tried to go to the Central Scottsdale location, and was told that I wasn't a wellness member there, so I couldn't use what I had already paid for. Called both locations 5 times each to get it worked out. I was being charged by BOTH locations for the Wellness program. Their fix? We will be happy to comp you some massages. You mean the ones I paid for? Very unprofessional front office staff. If you value good service, please avoid at all costs.
3 A coworker recommended Dr. Wachs after my regular doctor's office wasn't answering the phone.  Surprisingly, I called and was able to get an appointment the following day.  To be honest the reviews had me very leery.  Even my coworker said the staff is not that great, and it's unfortunate because it reflects badly on the doctor.  I went in expecting the worse and so far I have only had to see the doctor twice.  The first time I did wait for about 50 minutes before I even got a room.  I couldn't really complain because it was shorter than the wait I would have experience at Urgent Care.  So far I like the doctor.  She's very friendly although she did want to order additional testing which at the time I didn't think was necessary because it wasn't related to my visit.  My second visit was much quicker which could have had to do with her prior schedule commitments outside of the office.  I'm thankful I only get sick about once a year so based on my experiences with this office I will call them again if I have a future issue.
5 Dr. Jenson is phenomenal at his profession. I have seen him from time to time in past decade after several injuries. The first that I can remember was a back injury from playing football in high school, which he was able to alleviate with only a few visits. Most recently, I injured my tailbone doing jujitsu. This pain has lasted for months but began to decrease after visiting Dr. Jenson once a week. He brought the pain from about an 8 to 3 but unfortunately I am moving out of state and won't get to continue that spine health journey with him. I would highly recommend Arrowhead Lakes Chiropractic to a friend.
1 Waited for 3+ hours just to get a simple physical for work. They are slow sloppy and rude to everyone to comes in. DO NOT USE THIS LOCATION
5 Throughout a rigorous career as a stunt performer to now another physically demanding career as a Firefighter to one of the country's busiest fire stations, Alper has helped keep me moving well and freely while keeping myself in top physical condition. He has also helped me throughout a few tough injuries, some requiring surgery a few years ago and still keep me strong and competitive. I live a very active lifestyle away from the work life of course and take my health very seriously! I'd HIGHLY recommend to everyone!!
1 Dr. Leitner seems quite tentative in issuing needed prescriptions.  Had a recurring infected leg that he refused to prescripe an antibiotic ...ended up in emergency room on a week-end to get nessecary treatment. Also the office staff seems somewhat disorganized as referrals and prescriptions seldom get completed on a timely or accurate manner.  Sure wish Dr. Asins was still there ....
5 Nice service!  Ryan Linder is the RN who runs this spot.  I went for a vaccination here and I was very pleased with the speed and friendliness of the service.  Somewhere between the local urgent care clinic and getting a flu shot at Walgreens, you'll find this place.  If all you need is some minor medical service, try them first.  They're right inside of the Fry's.  Do some shopping and stop by.
5 Az chiropractic is an amazing place that makes you feel right at home, the whole staff is friendly and makes sure you leave feeling relieved and pain free! Dr Jeffrey does the adjustments and he has fixed my back and neck issues. The massage therapists are AMAZING, and so is their receptionist April!!! They text me reminders of my appointments and are willing to to reschedule appointments when things get hectic. I have recommended my pregnant wife and they have certified therapists that have really helped her feel pain free as well.
5 This is the first time I've ever been to urgent care, let alone this one. I thought that this was the best considering my other doctor visits elsewhere. The place did not open till 8, but they let me come in and sit down until they opened. Which was really nice. They were very accommodating and knew what they were talking about. I had brought my mom and my sister and they even gave my sister a cookie while I had a X-ray done because she wanted to come with me, but she could not.
5 I am extremely pleased with the results I am getting with their program. I am encouraged that I will have a rehab that will allow me to get back to being physically active.  Sara , Grace thank you for you patience and encouragement.
5 Tammy at CMM has been a part of my personal medical resource team for 5 years now.  She really knows her stuff!  She delivers what's advertised, a custom massage.  No matter if I am achy from exercise, or locked up from my job as a hairdresser, Tammy knows just what to do.  She's consistently excellent.
1 Did try to speak to Dr about staff issues - he was defensive and protective of his staff which i get but i expected that he would at lease listen to me regarding the course of events that led to my disappointment in his practice.  He was quick to dismiss me which made me suspicious.  He was very agitated with me for having an issue with his staff.  Also, he was told that I had hung up on staff member and that was not true.  The only thing i can think is that someone was covering up their mistake.  I have lost all confidence in this office managing my health.
2 After being a patient here for years and years it was time to leave. There is nothing but kind words to be said for the providers, I usually see Jenna Hilton, she is fabulous, so sweet, caring and concerned about the well being of her patients. As for the rest of the office, front office and medical assitants are a disaster. 90% of the time they are so extremely rude and short, thats if they even listen to what you are trying to say. Getting ahold of anyone in that office is an absolute joke. Leave a message and it takes days to hear back from anyone and its useless because they don't listen to the message you left to begin with. Communication is unbelievably low in this office. Sad to go because I loved my provider so much, but the rest of the staff is dragging them down.
4 I was impressed. The doctor saw me within a few minutes of my scheduled time. I was met by a nurse at the door, shown to an examining room and 2 doctors showed up quickly. The second one was  a medical student (he had a badge with  a U of A emblem on it) but they were both involved and professional. They listened, answered my questions and then a 3rd doctor showed up (the one who I was scheduled to see.) He reviewed their work quickly, answered my questions and gave me some options. I was out of there within 20 minutes.
5 Wait wasn't too long. Very clean. Everyone was very friendly and efficient . Would highly recommend it if you have an emergency.
2 When phoning to schedule my 1st appointment for a meet 'n' greet to interview a potential new G.P., the phone rang and rang & went to voicemail. The VM message stated they were now closed. I checked my watch, 4:53pm and tried again. And again. And again. On the 4th attempt, the receptionist answered, "What?!?". Shocked, I asked if this was in fact Toronto West Medical. Yes, she confirmed, openly annoyed. Told her I wanted to schedule an appt w/Dr. Brown and she went through the steps of booking with disdain and resentment seeping through her words. When I asked if everything was okay, that it seemed like it wasn't a good time, she said, no, it was not, and that she was having a bad day. Ha! I thought I was calling a doctor's office. You know, a professional operation. I just can't launch into how absurd her behaviour was.   When I met with Dr. Brown, he stopped me not once, not twice, but three times to handle a "technical situation". The 1st time, someone sent him a message on the computer--he interrupted me to reply. The 2nd time, he stopped talking to reply to another message. And then someone knocked on the exam room door & came in to ask him a question. And he let them, and answered it!  He explained the clinic's rules, gave me a long list of fees the clinic charges for things OHIP doesn't cover, the fees they charge for cancelling, and that I'm obligated to go one of the doctors in their group if I should need urgent care.   He was surprised and mildly irritated when I had questions of my own. As this was a "meet 'n' greet" I'm not sure why. I was asked to fill out and sign a form which was an agreement to be his patient. I asked him some questions about what I was agreeing to and what the fine print meant, and the answers all began with some derivation of "the ministry likes us to ______ so that we can get paid." or, "...because it makes it easier for us to get paid.". All the while, the voice in my head screaming, "What does that have to do with my health care?!?".  I explained I was meeting a couple of other doctors and I wanted to think about it. I specifically mentioned this b/c the fine print on the agreement said I was unable to look for a new family doctor for another 6 weeks if I select him as my new family doctor.   I left certain this was not the right fit. Two days later, when scheduling another meet 'n' greet, the receptionist was unable to schedule me b/c I was already listed as a patient of Dr. Brown's.   I find it a bit more than coincidental that Toronto West Medical must enter me as a new patient to get paid their full fees, and that I confirmed that I was still meeting other docs, and I didn't sign their stupid agreement!  Consider yourself warned!
4 I really like Dr. Perez. He spends a good amount of time with me and answers all questions. I think the Latin in him makes him a little touchy-feeley, which might rub some people the wrong way, but he doesn't mean any harm. Definitely has a comforting manner when you aren't feeling good. He seems to take an interest in you as a person and asks how things are going in life vs. just getting you "in and out" of the office -- like so many other places I've been to. Their front desk girl is a little out of place-- rushed and doesn't necessarily speak to clients in a professional manner. Overall a great family practice doctor's office.
5 EXCELLENT.  I tried a number of places in Cleveland before finding AHC.  I have now been going regularly for years - every time I injure myself. I use and have used their chiropractic, massage and physio staff, all of whom are really, really good at what they do.     Wonderful staff, great service, very effective.  They have a number of people in every position, making sure that there is variety and breadth of expertise.    THE BEST FACILITY IN CLEVELAND, and probably the best I've used in any of the cities I have lived in.
5 I've been sentenced to six weeks of therapy post-broken wrist and I love this place! The staff inspires your trust and my results have been remarkable with each visit. I would say anyone in need of physical therapy should try getting in to this place. Lisa Harris-Jordan is an excellent Certified Hand Therapist.
1 I had an awful experience with Dr. Marco Lo. He dismissed my symptoms and suggested it was psychosomatic. He also suggested I take a SSRI for anxiety or depression when I was not depressed or anxious. I was completely appalled. I could not believe he could be that insensitive and unprofessional. I basically told him that if he hasn't walked a day in the shoes of someone with a chronic illness, he really shouldn't imply that it's psychosomatic. It's actually distressing to know that doctors like him exist and are actually content with their practice. I would never ever go back and would pray that someone reads this message before deciding. If I can do that, I know I took the time to write this post for a reason.
5 this office is great, each person knows your name when you walk in and treats you with respect. definitely a different approach than any other chiropractor I've been to. They use essential oils and alternative therapies.
1 This is the WORST AND I MEAN WORST place I have ever been!!!! The first appt I ever had I had to wait almost 2 hours to be seen (plus I was with a baby). The total time I was there was 3 hours. For just a quick visit. Then I called to cancel an appt today and since I called at 8:30 and my appt for tomorrow is at 7:30 I am getting charged a no show because I didn't call in 24 hours. Because I was off by an hour!!! To dispute I have to actually go IN. Again. I have a baby so not the easiest thing to do. I am so livid. I do NOT recommend this office at all. Horrible!!!!!!!!! I had to click on a star, but I would give ZERO not even one.
1 after being a patient of Dr. Justin Maxwell for about a year, I was pretty disappointed in his care. At first it was fine as long as it's nothing serious , in early Dec I had an accident and ended up with cellulitis on my lower leg. It was painful and infected. I went to see him on Dec 22nd and he prescribed some meds and sent me on my way, had me get an ultrasound to make sure I didn't have a blot clot, so I went the following day, I called the office on the 27th to see if my results were in and they said no...... after 6 days my leg wasn't getting better, in fact it was getting worse, this was the week of New Year's and I work in a casino, holidays are impossible to get off and if you call in the points are doubled... Anyway, when I noticed it wasn't going to get better and I was running low on the meds to fight the infection I started calling his office and begged to see him for two days I called and no one would return my calls, I was in pain and had to continue working on a swollen leg, standing on it for 8 hours. Finally my husband gets through and one of the nurses asked Maxwell if he would see me since my insurance was days from expiring and he would no longer take the new one come Jan 1. his response " have her go to URGENT CARE" are you kidding me???   So on Dec 28th I went to urgent care, Dr Nguyen    took one look at my leg and was surprised to see after 6 days my leg was still big , red and hot  the meds I was taking weren't working it shouldn't have looked that way, so he had me stop taking them and prescribed some much stronger ones, he asked me if I had gotten my ultrasound results from Dr Maxwell and I said no, I just went with the  "no news is good news' theory ,   Dr Nguyen  was surprised that Maxwell would send me to him without even giving me my results,  even made the comment  " he's not doing his job" as he shook his head..........as it turns out they were fine, BUT that's not the point, the Dr highly suggested I wear a compression stocking and prescribed one for me, a suggestion Maxwell NEVER made .  Dr. Nguyen  also said I should stay off  my feet for at least a couple of days to allow the swelling to subside. Being that it was NYE weekend I knew by calling in I would get points at work so I called for FMLA papers to be faxed to Maxwell's office. Tuesday the 3rd my insurance had expired but I figured he would fill out the paperwork since he treated me for cellulitis. I called and asked his receptionist if he was going to fill them out, she said yes but put me on hold just to make sure, she came back on and said " Dr Maxwell wont be filling out your FMLA paperwork since you're no longer his patient and he's not taking the insurance you're now on"  WOW........ talk about getting slapped not once but twice by him ...so in theory I was never his patient I was his customer....
1 As a former patient, I must say,although dr yee was thorough in her testing and questions,the waiting times(never got in the office until waiting 1 1/2 hr in waiting room,truly!) Were ridiculous!everytime I have waited,and the front desk is horrible and not very helpful. They aren't happy,short with you and not wanting to go that extra mile and have screwed up with lab work and medical records,id say I would NOT reccomend this practice to anyone, if only the docs could really be FOR their patients,call backs,smiles,no screw ups in giving people wrong lab tests and med records...don't go here
1 Strongly recommend you look elsewhere. I made the mistake of going here for my annual physical last fall, since I missed the onsite sessions at my employer. This place made me wait for hours (literally) for basic blood tests, and added unnecessary procedures to a basic physical to plump up the bill. To make matters worse, they billed to my insurance using the wrong diagnosis codes, so things that should be fully covered weren't. They were unwilling to change the codes even though it would cost them nothing. Oh, and their phones often don't work, so you can't even call to deal with them.  There are plenty of other good places to go - don't waste your time.
5 I have used a lot of chiropractors over the course of the last thirty years and Dr. Meyers and her team are easily the best. Dr. Meyers has worked on several of my issues over the last few years and (unlike some of the other clinics that I have used) you can tell that she works to directly correct the issue instead of setting you up to return to the clinic as many times as possible in order to maximize profits. She also went way above and beyond to get my medical records in order for my attorney in regards to an automobile accident. Arizona Pain Relief is a very heart based clinic, which, is always refreshing to find nowadays.
4 Came here for my grandmother. Not too bad of wait, for it being a Doctor office. Friendly staff.
5 I hate going to the doctor and really just avoided it. I finally had no choice and had to go. Dr. Pape who I trust with my life recommended Dr. Kimberly Adams at Total Wellness Family Medicine. So I chose to try her out. I checked in and of course they are busy as all Doctors offices are plus to me that's a good sign. I checked in and ladies were like family. Like "You sit over here for dinner". I waited and this spunky cute lady who's attitude is like Flo from the alice tv show takes you back and does your vitals and gets a quick chat about why you are there. She leaves and the Dr. Kim comes in. She is sweet, caring, listens to everything and must really care. I had some things happening that were weighing on me. She must have known because she just didn't say a word and touched my shoulder while looking at me and gave a little squeeze as if to say "I get it.....and I care". She recommended a few specialists that were also awesome. THANK YOU DR. KIMBERLY ADAMS AND TOTAL WELLNESS FAMILY MEDICINE. Truly......Thank you!!
5 Dr Swenson is very intelligent and truly cares . Highly recommend . In a world full of jaded doctors he stands out
5 Awesome training centre. Great staff. Fantastic Trainers. Unique Environment. Amazing heathy post-workout refuelling! I go 3-4x a week and am challenged each time! Love it there.
1 This place is horrible.. Waited 2 hours to get called, literally 2 hours !! Because there was only one doctor in today ,and then waited forever to see the doctor. When the doctor came to tell me my result of my test . I then explained my pain and problems , and she didn't even care , and said so and ? Was in a hurry to leave . Didn't even care .I then said my problems I had more and she told me im not this kind of doctor and left in so mean voice .... Really ???...  I went to see a DOCTOR , I waited 2 hours to see you ! And that's how I get treated ?!!! Never ever I will be back here again !!!  You could at least be nicer !!!
5 excellent service, doctor was very knowledgeable, price was reasonable, rooms were clean, staff was really friendly
1 My father is in this hospital, it is very understaffed. My father fell out of his bed no help for over an hour until he could crawl to his cell phone to call my sister.  Patients yelling for nurses to get their attention. Very disturbing, we are trying to get him transferred asap. Went to visit him on a Wed. morning and came out to my car at noon to find  my car windshield hit by a stray bullet. Security was very nice but they cant do anything about it.  Police came and explained its the area.  NEVER, EVER will be back!!!!!
5 Had a fantastic experience here. The entire staff was friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. By far the best experience I've had at any healthcare facility in the valley. Highly recommend!
5 great doctor, had not slept in weeks for pain gave me new meds and pain has diminished so I can sleep. I had injections by him and was pain free for 2 1/2 years he hit the correct spot which I've heard is often not effective if missed!
5 I just "graduated" today. The 7 weeks of therapy for the arthroscopic surgery on my knee was made very pleasant by the sweet and caring staff. Tara (PHD) was my skilled therapist, increasing the difficulty of the exercises gradually. There was always someone around to make sure that I was doing things right. They even added fun stuff like having all of us vote in their pumpkin-carving contest.
1 Couple patients and I have been waiting for 2 more hours even with the appointment.  They are nicely keep asking everyone to wait. And we wait until the office is closed and the reception left. And we stuck in the office with no one but the security.  They just think we would leave if we keep waiting without refund.
5 The best doctor I've found. And a very friendly staff. Caring and professional. Always listens fully to my concerns. Discussing the best treatment options for me. And doesn't give up. His care has literally changed my life.
1 I was recommended to Dr. Tsai by a former co-worker who had great things to say about him when I was new in town and needing to find a new general care practitioner. Dr. Tsai might be the best doctor ever, but I'll never know because of how rude his receptionist was.   I called to ask about making an appointment, said I had never been in there before and that I was pointed to Dr. Tsai by a co-worker. The receptionist proceeded to ask the usual question of what kind of insurance I had and as I was digging my cards out of my purse I told her that I had already looked up Dr. Tsai on my insurance plan and he was in my network. I told her what kind of insurance I had and was ready to give her my info when she rudely cut me off and said  "We aren't accepting new patients right now."  I understand that, it happens. But I asked why she even bothered to ask what kind of insurance I had - obviously it didn't matter- if they weren't taking new patients. Why didn't she just say that up front?   Rudely again she said, "well if you had medicare we would take you," I replied that I did not and she just hung up on me! No goodbye, no have a nice day, no sorry for the inconvenience, nothing. She just hung up!   I understand doctors get full and can't always take new patients, but there are more polite ways for staff to explain it. They could also - POLITELY - just say when they answer that they aren't accepting new patients unless they have medicare. Easy and simple.   The receptionist was just plain rude and acted as though I was inconveniencing her by even calling. Sadly, rude front of the house staff just seems to be the norm in this city.
5 Just signed up today. Svonte helped me out and showed me around really cool dude. Can't wait to start working out here, the sauna and cardio theater sold me.
5 Maureen Dwight is so knowledgeable, so able to communicate what she knows in easy to understand ways and she is so caring.  I often arrive feeling down and hopeless but I always leave feeling positive and hopeful.  She told me how long it would take for my back to improve and she was right (in fact, she was conservative and my back felt better a earlier than her prediction).  I have tried many other professionals and was disappointed.  She has not disappointed once.  I am feeling like a new person.  The exercises she has taught me have changed the way I think about my body and moving and that thinking has taken hold and no longer requires my conscious thought ... it's remarkable.  I noticed on the subway the other day that for the first time I was not in pain standing as the subway moved.  I realized it was because I had activated my core WITHOUT THINKING, what Maureen had told me would eventually happen.  Thank you Maureen!!!
2 I took my deaf daughter here this morning for lower abdominal pain and problems urinating (feeling she constantly had to go pee and not being able to hardly go)- the doctor acted like she was a leper. As soon as he entered our room and asked us why we were there, he said that he felt it was an appendicitis and we needed to take her to the ER. He then stood, leaning against the far wall of the room, with his arms crossed over his chest and told me that they only did lab work for insured patients and we needed to take her to the ER. This sure was not mentioned to me when I paid $125 cash for her to be seen in the lobby before we even entered the examination room. He had the nurse give us a urine specimen cup and said it came back free of all blood or urinary issues.  He gave us a letter to take to the ER offering up his diagnosis of the appendicitis. I was then charged an additional $20 for the urine test as I left. We went to the ER and she had a kidney stone and there was blood in her urine. We were then sent home with meds until it passes. I was pretty sure that's what the Urgent Care Center was set up to avoid. We will not be using their services again.
4 Office is easy to find. The staff was friendly and helpful. The office was clean. The doctor was nice, made me feel comfortable. The only thing about my visit I didn't like was that I had to wait 20 mins to see the doctor, but it's okay because once I got to see him, he made my visit go by fast. I think I found my new gynecologist office. Thank you!
5 This doctor was AMAZING.  I was so sick one evening and he continued to call me every hour all night to make sure I was ok until I fell asleep.  He also saved me from having to go to the ER.  He really was incredible...picked up every phone call and even called me the next morning to make sure I was feeling better.  All doctors should be like this.  I cannot say enough good things about him!  I only wish Dr. Logan was in LA!!!
1 don't  challenge Veronica on wait time she will make it longer put 6-8 people ahead of me wh checked in after by as much as half an hour . doctors push you through and don't explain process or  ailment was put in pt with no knowledge of problem now worse and prescribed meds contrary to heart meds which were disclosed. trust me they will not maybe but definitely will kill someone soon if not already. beware
1 Worse pediatrics office in this valley. Every single time I'm here I wait for over an hour after my scheduled appointment and the staff isn't exactly friendly.  Not to mention there's always some balance due even though I paid in full.
5 I never thought the day would roll around when my mom would stop telling me to sit up straight (even at 31 years old). It always hurt to sit without slouching, I always thought I was domed to look like a hunchback with a lot of back pain.  After a few visits with Dr. Steve, my posture has improved, I don't find myself cracking my neck and back all the time, I can sleep on my back whereas before I always lower back pain.   I would definitely recommend Dr. Steve to anyone who needs a top-notch chiropractor!
1 Most disgusting attitudes from staff and Dr's. And treat you with no care or feelings and very discriminating.
5 I am beyond happy with the level of care and depth of knowledge Dr. Boothe is able to deliver. I travel for work and outside of the last few years - pride myself in being in moderately good shape. Sitting all day weakened my posterior chain and caused a great deal of lower back pain.   Dr. Boothe was able to actively work on my pain, while giving me the tools and know-how to continue my work outside appointments. His approach in looking at the whole system, behavior and accompanying muscle groups has not only greatly reduced my pain - it has educated me in areas that were previously inaccessible to me.    I greatly appreciate his ability to put technical and clinical terminology into layman's terms in a practical way for me to digest and use.   In an industry ripe with gimmicks and snake oil salesman - Dr. Boothe delivers the goods!!   ProCare for the win!!
5 Having gone the route of weight training, with the mentoring of friends at some of the big chain gyms, I was not getting the results I had hoped for. Finding KX, initially because of its convenient location, I found exactly what I needed. Not only am I doing exercises properly now, the staff at KX have also helped me to tailor a diet that suits my goals as well as supply supplements that fit my needs.     My experience at KX has been great! I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to make the most of their workout experience...and the most of the small amount of time most of us have to workout.
5 loved the very personal client treatment.  Never felt that I was just a number, but treated my injury with great concern & help throughout my therapy!!!
5 Love True Harmony!   I've been coming here since they opened & the whole staff is always helpful & courteous.  Dr. Grobi & Dr. Brass-Jones are great!  I refer people here all the time.  Even my husband goes.
1 This is the worst experience I had at a doctor's place.  First of all, the doctor lacks a lot of knowledge and can't answer the simplest question.  We came to get a doctor's note as my brother was sick and she didn't know how to fill it!  She told us to pay twice because once you get "better" you have to get another form which is complete nonsense.  Not only that, she is completely unapproachable and when you ask her questions she gives a lot of attitude.  Furthermore, you apparently have to buy your prescription from there because it is their "policy" that once it has been sent to them you cannot print it out again.  We have come here multiple times but have never heard of this policy.  So when we questioned her about it she told us that we should've told her before she sent it!  BUT SHE NEVER ASKED US IF WE WANTED TO BUY THE MEDICATION FROM THEIR PHARMACY BEFORE SENDING IT TO THEM!  In general, avoid this place and save your time.
5 I love Dr. Reed and Megan. They are very friendly. I had significant improvement and was out of pain in a very short amount of time!!! And it's getting better everyday! This is my first experience with a chiropractor  and I have to say I am impressed! THANK YOU DR. REED!
1 I love my doctor but, I hate waiting every time I come here n today I'm getting my blood test done which I can't make an appointment for n couldn't eat anything before I came in they r making me wait because it's her lunch time...really!!!
2 My child goes to see a Doctor here. The front desk crew is not very welcoming or very nice. They have to finish theory conversations before helping anyone standing at the counter. Their customer service skills are way below par for being in the medical industry. No bedside manners at all. The lady who takes blood is very mean....if you hate your job, find another profession. The reception area and front desk area are extremely dirty, does anyone know how to dust or sweep? I only give this place a 2 stars because my child likes the Doctor (no complaints about the doctor). Also, if my appointment is at 3, I expect to be in no later then 10 minutes after. I've already been here for 30 minutes over and counting just to get lab work done. Not acceptable! We are in the process of searching for a new doctor.
5 I am a newer client to Arcadia H&W.  Truly, I'm not really a big fan of Chiropractors in general, I'm old school.  I have to admit that since I've been a client I feel much better physically and mentally.  The staff at the office is very friendly and professional but also friendly and available, more so than other Dr. offices I have been to.  I have recommended Dr. Matt and Dr. Dom to many friends at this point and I am now a believer in Chiropractic care.  Great place to get "adjusted"!
5 It's just this simple:   I've had issues with my lower back and when it tweaks out, I'm usually wincing in pain and sleeping like a rotisserie chicken for weeks and months until it goes away.   The fist time it went out on me a few years ago I literally got rid of my sports car for an SUV because I was sick of grimacing when I got in and out of the car.   The last time it went out, it morphed into sciatica and lingered for weeks.   So when it spasm'd literally two days before my Triathlon, my heart sank because I thought the months of training were about to go for naught. But if not for that I wouldn't have broken down and got the referral from my local tri shop to visit them.  I was able to get in for a treatment before the race and was happy to find out, while I might be in pain, the issue was soft tissue and I could choose to race.  I finished my Tri and though my back was not great on the bike, I was able to compete.   I had two treatments the following week and the problem is about 95% gone after 3 treatments and within two weeks.    So I'm a believer and so glad I decided to go in and so happy I can get back to training.    I would also say that an added bonus the environment itself is really awesome, Matt and all the gang at ER are funny and fun and make "Physical Therapy" as enjoyable as it could be when you're having elbows buried into your glutes.
5 My doctor is Dr. Bezard, a member of this group.  I must say this is the best experience I've ever had at a doctors office in my entire life! All of the assistants are on point. Everyone is smiling and accommodating. Dr. Bezard  himself is extremely detailed and I actually enjoy visiting with him - imagine that!  I really can't say enough. You need to go to this doctor!
1 I alwYs go to Umc but this time it was after 730 so they were closed... First thing is I called them to make sure they were contracted with my insurance they said yes.... (They weren't) I thought my kids were going to be seen by an MD... They weren't it was an APN which is fine but diagnosed my daughter with noro virus just bcuz it was going around at the time anyways long story short they aren't contracted with health plan of Nevada I called their billing department and they told me they didn't know who they were contracted with but billed all insurance wth??? AnywAys now I'm stuck with a $300 bill from them for seeing an APN that did not give us any prescription next time I'm sticking to Umc they are awesome... Extra urgent care sucks that's why they r always empty
5 The front desk lady was rude to so many people first of all but the cna and Dr. Calbrese ive been with for 4 years and always makes me feel like family and listens to all my concerns i don't know about the other doctor though ive only seen the guy once.  Never had a bad experience there.
5 Well well well, where do I begin? I have the pleasure of visiting Luanna (I'm sure I always spell it wrong) fairly often, but not often enough. I'd go every week if I could, and I know she could make that happen, but suffice it to say "in this economy" I go as often as I can.  She has a true passion for her line of work and it shows. I'm a hair stylist, and am on my feet all day (on a good day!) and constantly having my arms in the forward raised position. After my massage I feel taller and lighter both physically and mentally. She'll talk to you the whole time if youwant and be almost a therapist, or if you prefer a quiet time she has no problem being silent the whole 90 minutes. Oh yeah 90 minutes, 60 just isn't enough! Also, she offers packaged deals online and I just love to know I have massage credits in a stockpile ready to use at my leisure. I recomend her to everyone.
5 LOVE LOVE LOVE this office. The doctors nurses and just staff in general are awesome. They never make me feel foolish if I am feeling like over worried mom bring my kid in for fevers etc (which I'm not cause turns out ear infection each time). They always answer all questions and concerns. They just are a wonderful staff. And we have been to other doctors. And we are sticking here. Even if I move I'll still come here. Amanda Gunn is amazing and won't regret seeing her! My children love her. Super polite and super professional
5 Highly recommended!  From my first visit I knew I was in great hands. The office staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and willing to go above and beyond to assist in any way they could. Dr. Nakra was my surgeon and is without hesitation the best doctor I have ever worked with. She is a staple in her profession and anyone lucky enough to have her as their surgeon will be forever changed.
1 It was after normal business hours on a weekday, and I needed somewhere to take my 4 year old to confirm my suspicions about him having strep throat. Normally, we go to he's pediatrician but his suffering couldn't wait until tomorrow. I used the yelp app, and sought out this urgent care based on the reviews and the incentive that said if I "checked in" I would receive a voucher for an "in-house prescription". Done. So I buckled up the kids and drove over, checked in and the nurse practitioner confirmed that he would need antibiotics to fight off his bacterial infection. She asked if I wanted to have them fill his prescription there. Sure! That's convenient! I even told her that I had this voucher from yelp, and she said I could show it when I checked out to redeem it. On the track to a five star review so far....  Then... I get to the check out desk and show my voucher, and the girl tells me that because I had been to their urgent care before (once 3 years ago) I was not eligible for the voucher. She was firm on this and didn't bother to get a manager, or show any concern at all. It wasn't as if I had already used this voucher and I was trying to double dip or abuse the system. I felt like I was doing them a favor by checking in, promoting their business and was prepared to write an outstanding review after my appointment but then they blindside me with this awful ending. And for that reason, I will make a point to never return to this dishonest urgent care. They lure you in, and then don't follow through with offers they extend through the very app that consumers use to rate them! Unreal that when it came down to it, customer service is NOT their top priority.
1 After reading all of the reviews I was very excited to try this place. I've actually only written one semi negative review on yelp because I believe in spreading positivity, not negativity. I just moved to the area and found the studio on yelp and saw it was only 6 minutes away. I got there today at 5:20 AM for the morning session. The studio was very nice.  However, the front desk associate was not. This was an older woman with long hair. I told her I've never been here and I'd like to do the $30 for 30 day new member offer. This woman was extremely rude to me. It seemed as though I was a great inconvenience to her. She handed me the form to fill out. As filling out I ignored her attitude and mentioned that I typically go to Sumits. She snaps "well this is nothing like Sumits" and then explains the flow. Okay, I say, that's fine. I then say well I guess I do want to ask, I typically have to leave at 6:30 because I have to get ready for work and be there at 8:00. She looks at me like I just cussed at her or something. Oh well you can but really it's meant to be the 90 minute and then she just glared at me. I just kind of looked at her and say alright I guess it may not work. I put the pen down and leave. There's more awkwardness to it but hard to write out. She just gives me a dirty look and does not say anything, no thank you, goodbye, nothing. I know this whole review may sound petty but I am just in shock by how rude this woman was. Yoga and meditation is supposed to be a place filled with love, peace, and happy people! I've been practicing for almost 2 years now and have never felt such negative energy in a studio before. This woman had such bad energy, she does not even belong in this business. I actually work down the street as a property manager, I'll be sure to stop telling all of my residents about the Bikram Studio around the corner. I'll refer them elsewhere. From what the studio website states, they just re-opened. I would highly suggest a more customer service oriented and courteous individual representing their company, otherwise they will loose a lot of business. They just lost 10+ new memberships here!
1 Horrible place to go. Waited for 3 hours until they called me into a room and an additional 30 mins until they saw me. Customer service isn't exceptional and the lobby is pretty crappy. Get it together Cima!
5 I travel across the entire city in order to have the pleasure of being treated by Alper. He is unbelievable! If you need a deep massage he has such a gift here. He is a registered massage therapist and also going to school for osteopathy so you get the best of both worlds. He loves to figure out what's going on with your body and is super passionate about figuring out how to make you feel better. He is professional, a gentle person, has a huge love of learning, and I have witnessed firsthand that he can fix a problem like tennis elbow in one session. He is outstanding!
1 One star is actually generous. You would think that a staff expecting clients who are under the weather would be more caring and helpful. It was immediately apparent that these qualities were absent in almost every employee at the facility. Please consider customer service training. Compassion and setting clear expectations as to waiting time would be a great start. Waited over a half hour in the waiting room, which could use a good vacuuming, then longer in the exam room. When I peeked into the hall, two unprofessional young staffers informed me that they were very busy and then returned to their obviously non-business related gossip. The only professional and courteous staffer was the physician assistant who thankfully appeared after over an hour. Go somewhere else.
5 Dr. Kuhn is very focused on your overall wellness and won't just put a band-aide on your symptoms. He runs a great professional facility, and is up to date in the most modern treatment methods.   Dr. Kuhn was able to identify and fix my ailing shoulder in one treatment. I saw Dr. Kuhn after experiencing a few weeks of pain in my shoulder, and the sensation that my shoulder was "giving out" even under small amounts of stress. For example - when lifting my mountain bike into the back of my pickup truck - I had the sensation of sharp pain, and a feeling that my shoulder "gave out" under the light weight of my bike.   Dr. Kuhn used a technique called the Graston Technique which he explained to me in detail. He took the time to explain the treatment with me, what he would do during the session and what I could expect afterwards. Dr. Kuhn did explain that treatment could take more than one session - in my case it worked it one treatment, which was wonderful. I can not even begin to explain the immediate relief that I had. It was like night and day. I will be using Dr. Kuhn for all of my sports chiropractic needs!!
1 This office has been closed for a couple weeks now due to Dr. Chung's arrest.  I've never experienced a doctor of mine being arrested but I do wish there was a way to contact the staff or to obtain my medical records.  At this point all you get when you call the office is a message on a loop saying to email  for your records.  Obviously, I have done this but have yet to hear anything.
5 I was visiting LV with my husband last week, broke my toe and was in a lot of pain.  Visited this clinic and was treated very well.  Upon arriving at front desk I was told of expected duration of visit (accurate estimation) of apprx 1.5 hrs from sign in until completion of visit.    From initial contact until I left the clinic, I was treated like family.  Staff was friendly knowledgeable, professional and courteous. This clinic showed as much "aloha" as we do in Hawaii Nei.    I would definitely return if needed and I will share with everyone the great service I received from this clinic.  Mahalo Concentra!
5 Dr. Steve Van Laecken is the best chiropractor I have ever been to. I've been a chiropractic patient for 20 years in another city. I am so thankful to have found such a great doctor. He is truly focused on healing.   He takes the time to treat any subluxations but also gives his attention to the soft tissue that may also be affected. It is obvious from sing what he has available in his office for patient care that he is dedicated to giving his patients the most effective care.   I came in the first time with severe neck pain that had been developing for the last two years. My back was also painful. I was in so much pain by the time I came for my first appointment that I was near tears. He was very understanding and patient and has continued to encourage me. My neck and back now have less than half the pain I came in for, and I can actually tell by feeling it that my neck vertebrae are being aligned to the curve that should be there. It has taken a couple months of regular treatment, and there has been steady improvement.   He is the first doctor I've been to who has ever given me such comprehensive care, and I really needed it for my severe neck pain. He knew what additional treatment my neck had to have in order to be restored to what is should be - and he has that care right in his office.  The level of care at SpinalWorks is top notch from Dr. Steve and his excellent staff. Every person is treated with respect, kindness, compassion, and patience even when things get busy.   After being in such pain for a couple years, what a blessing to find such a great doctor and staff.
1 I was at the Santan Mall when these people were there giving away free seated massages. I had just hurt my back so it was perfect timing. At that time I spoke to a lady that was at the event and she was telling me about a special they were offering for $10. That included a consultation and x-rays and a treatment plan set up and a massage. She asked me what kind of insurance I had, I told her. Blue Cross Blue Shield. She said great that they could work with me. She sold me on that and the fact that they were MD's, chiro's and PT all in one. I went to my first appointment and they were great. They did all of the x-rays and said that they would have me back in the next day or two to let me know what the dr found out and what our plan of action will be and what my insurance will cover and what my co-pays will be. I took time off of work and went to my 2nd appointment and they showed me my x-rays, told me what they saw and went through a treatment plan that they would like for me to do. The Dr. asked if I had any questions and I said can someone please go over prices with me. He said "I just don't understand. Don't you want to feel better, let's just go ahead and start your treatment and then they will go over that with you." I was not certain and so I said, I would like to be advised of that first. He was a little upset about that and went to get someone and they came in and said we contacted your insurance co. but we are not on their network so they will not pay so you will need to do our cash prices. They treatment recommended was about $4200. I was like "What?"  I said I could not do that. He said well if you pay all up front we will give you a 20% discount. I said, no. And I said what was the problem exactly with the insurance? He stated that they were just not contracted with my company. I said, well I gave the lady all of that info at the mall BEFORE I made these appointments and when I was here 2 days ago I gave it to the front desk lady and did you know at that time my insurance would not cover this? He said yes but they don't go over any of that until the 2nd appointment. I tried to explain that it would have been nice to know BEFORE because I took off of work drove 20 minutes to get there. I was just disappointed in the lack of concern for how they treated me regarding that and then almost felt like the Dr. was trying to bully me into getting treatment that day KNOWING that my insurance would not cover it. He felt like more of a salesman than a dr. I will make sure that I tell my friends about this so that they do not have to experience this for themselves. A place of business should not have to operate on scamming people in or bullying them to stay.
2 On the plus side, I was fit in quickly, and was able to book fairly easily in a time slot that worked well for me. It mostly ran on time, and seemed fairly professional. On the negative side, nobody told me before I came what clothes I should wear for the initial assessment. Additionally, I didn't particularly feel comfortable with the physiotherapist I was seeing. I found her manner and demeanour off-putting, and I felt judged by her. I realize that's possibly in my head, and it was probably just a personality conflict, but it made me strongly dislike going. Additionally, I found it annoying to be charged $75 for a followup appointment that lasted around 15 minutes, and made me feel like I was being rushed out and not properly looked after. Something was missing to build the trust necessary to make me feel confident in the clinic and the physiotherapists.
1 This is absolutely the worst doctors office I have ever been to. I have never been to a doctors office that is so completely on organized. I cannot tell you how many times I have made an appointment here and they screw it up. And they order tests and labs that you don't need and didn't ask for and get billed for them. The front office I don't know what's up with those girls but they are all in competent asses. I'm surprise he even know how to drive themselves to work much less turn on a computer and make a damn appointment correctly.
5 My first visit yesterday, i went for therapy in my shoulder, they was very pleasant, the atmosphere very relaxing, nice people, i felt very comfortable, when i left i felt much better, they did a great job, front desk was fast n therapists was very helpful, i recommend this place
3 Mixed opinion: Be prepared to wait for a very long time. I don't know if all providers are running behind. But I have never been seen on time.  2 hours wait usually.  Everyone is very nice but you have to use the whole day for a visit plus travel. Very hard to find a healthcare in AZ in my little opinion so till I find one closer and more timely I will be coming here. Going to the doctors visit is stressful as it is and I find myself getting impatient and anxious. Oh well! I will keep researching.
5 Susan is one of the most kind and compassionate health care professionals I have ever dealt with. She is incredibly knowledgeable and resourceful. On top of that, she has a great sense of humor. I am so glad that I have given her a chance and now she has become my go to person for all my health questions and concerns. While her practice happened to not take my insurance, her cash price for a visit is  very reasonable for a thirty minute visit and she makes sure that all of your questions are answered. Thank you Susan and Carrie for making me feel so welcome into your practice to which I wish much deserved and continued success!
1 Totally disappointed. My wife had an emergency double by-pass while visiting Spokane. I needed a primary care doctor for follow-up and referral to a cardiologist. I scheduled an appointment for the following week. When we arrived at the Charleston office, we were informed that our appointment had been cancelled. apparently Dr Hong wasn't available. They apparently left a phone message on our Vegas phone, but didn't bother to call my wife's mobile phone. We were left hanging since they couldn't provide another appointment for a month. Thanks Dignity Health.
5 Been a patient for 15 years. Highly recommend as they have saved me after various injuries. Wonderful staff and Doctors.
5 Well now that the pool filter blew up and almost took off my hand and after the surgeon put everything back together (Dr. Hijazi did a great job and I thank him for his great work). Matt & Brooke at RH are helpful and a pleasure to work with. I am concerned about getting full motion back after 5 breaks and surgery. I want to be able to play the guitar badly again. Right now I can't get my left hand around the neck. More to come......
1 WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO FAMILY OR FRIENDS!!!   Yesterday, I visited the clinic for my son's arm.  We checked in at the facility at 3:20 pm, and were called in for triage very shortly since the facility was not busy at all.  After the triage, we were assigned to Room #1 and a nurse mentioned that there was only one patient ahead of us and a doctor would be with us shortly.  Since then, we waited 40 minutes until my son was told to take X-ray.  Then, he was taken to an X-ray room and came back to the room shortly.  Another 30 minutes, nothing happened and just waiting.  The doctor finally came to our room with a dispatch paper, after I complained about nothing happened for an hour and 20 minutes.    Bottom line, we waited an hour and 20 minutes to spend literally 3 minutes with a doctor or nurse practitioner.  I dismissed early from work and so did my son from his school in order to visit the urgent care.  They should know my time is as valuable as theirs.
1 This doctor does not like patients who HAVE insurance and he does not listen to you. He just quotes studies and bad mouths all the other doctors in town. His staff is unprofessional and the office is run down. I would not recommend this doctor.
5 These are the best adjustments I have ever had. I have been to a lot of chiropractors and Dr. Lundgren is the best and most precise. He is not like other chiropractors out there that just try to take your money.
5 I come to the Las Vegas Pain Relief Center to see Dr. Petrick. The staff is friendly, competent, helpful  and fun in an appropriate manner. Dr. Petrick is amazing! I come in to see him in so much pain, and by the time I'm out the door, I am feeling so much better, if in any pain at all. I enjoy going to Dr. Petrick and have sent many friends and colleagues to see him. If you're in pain and can't handle it anymore, give Dr Petrick and his staff a try... They are 5 star all across the board! They explain everything, and they all care about you as an individual.
1 I want to preface by saying that the service I received from the specialist I saw was great. However, once I was done with my session, I went to pay using my gift certificate I had received for Mother's Day for the amount the person who purchased it for me was quoted as being the amount it would be for me to receive a facial or massage. The person at the counter informed me that because I had once before used Massage Envy in the past (also from a gift certificate), that the service would cost almost double what my fiance had been told. Then, they proceeded to tell me that it would not be that much, I would just have to sign up for a "12 payment obligation" totalling almost $800. I was actually considering a membership until it occurred to me that they were trying to bully me into an $800 commitment from a gift that I received. I will never do business with Massage Envy again and I will go out of my way to ensure everyone I know will avoid it as well.
1 Beware! Questionable billing practices...  In my experience they care is, well OK, if you don't mind the fast food approach to chiropractic care,  but the billing practices are appalling.   My experience: After being hard sold and promised the world I was told pain relief could be mine for the low low price of $ x amt to satisfy my deductible. This would buy me X # of treatments! physical therapy! trigger point injections! etc. etc.  I realized, after draining my HSA (and receiving less than half of the services promised), my deductible had in fact not been met. Because they were billing me out of network for treatment, my supposed deductible money went to my "out of network" deductible. I immediately called and told them I was not interested in receiving out of network care and I wanted to be reimbursed for treatment not received. The rep proceeded to try to convince me that it made no difference whether it was in or out of network. What? I mean sure, if you like paying double for everything...um, no thank you...I explained that, to me, it indeed did. Now, I had spent all of my allocated funds that were for meant meeting my deductible.  I explained that, unbeknownst to me, I had not actually met my deductible. He asked me why it mattered? Did I want to see another doctor? (What the heck, right?) I explained, that indeed, I needed additional care for another health problem and NOW I to come up with my deductible AGAIN so I could get treatment! He acted as though he had no idea how these things work, which I find funny since he is the one that explains your benefits to you once they have "sold you services." He told me he would send my issue to billing and see about getting a refund for the services not received. I did get a call but the "billing" person acted as though she had never heard the story. I explained it again to her and she promised me a call back. After calling and leaving several messages I received another call from the person I spoke to the first time. He, again, acted as if was all new info. Again I was promised a call back. No one has attempted to contact me again despite leaving several messages again. I did, however, receive a COLLECTIONS notice from them because I had not sent them the checks from my insurance company (which I have been holding until they came back with a resolution). Hahaha. Well at least they can follow through on debt collection!    I think it is possible they run this game frequently but many people do not catch what they are doing. They will "honor" your in network deductible but not explain that they are writing off the rest. This way you have no idea (why would you question it if the $ seems right?) that you are actually not satisfying your "in network" deductible. This allows them to get more people in the door. They can bill for crazy stuff like PT (that is not being provided by a physical therapist BTW.)   Hey, perhaps I received 3000$ worth of care. I am sure all those injections and braces and muscle stems and blah blah blah add up to all the money I was charged but it seems to me if I was supposed to get care and didn't receive it that I may be due some sort of refund, or at least a breakdown of what they billed and an explanation of some sort from them.   I know I deserve more than being duped and ignored.   I may never get resolution but I do not want another person to have this happen to them. I had to meet my deductible twice to receive additional care because of other health problems. They have cost me money and time and caused delays in receiving much needed healthcare services. They billed me and possibly my insurance company for services that were never actually provided and have zero consideration for the issues this has caused. I take full responsibility for not doing my homework and ensuring they were in network. But I know they purposely left out that very vital tidbit. We expect healthcare providers to be upfront and honest and it bit me in the ass. Never again will it. At least I learned a valuable lesson.   They are making money off of people's lack of knowledge. They misrepresent what they are doing. They are sure to make you sign a slew of documents (think car sales) that I am sure were carefully prepared by lawyers to ensure what they are doing is "legal".   Legal, maybe...ethical,absolutely not.   My advice: stay far far away.
5 Spooner PT has been amazing!! Everyone there has an awesome attitude, are genuinely engaged in the health of the patients, and make it fun and enjoyable to be there. I can't recommend them enough!
5 I have been going here for like 10 years and have never had a bad experience.  I see dr. Barb and she is very caring and you can tell she loves helping make you feel better.  The receptionists are always very nice and helpful.
5 After having a baby, I had severe back and hip issues that sent me to the ER and kept me immobile for three months. I met with three PTs (including one who aggravated my pain so much that it sent me to the ER), two pain specialists, two chiropractors and even an orthopedic specialist who all sent me packing after thoughtfully scratching heads.  Eric Christensen was the only one who took a big picture approach, tested my body's overall mechanics and worked out a diagnosis and solution for my not-in-the-textbook problem. He spends time tweaking and testing every visit and doesn't mindlessly run through an exercise playbook. I don't spend half my 75 min appointment time lying down getting STEM massages or ice packs, it is all manipulation or exercise. After almost a year, I'm stronger, healthy and pain free. He also helped my husband get back to full physical activity after surgery for a lumbar herniated disc. I believe this chap can solve every musculoskeletal problem there is to be had. Also, he has a fun pun for everyone.
2 Let me start off by saying that Dr. Middleton was the only reason I came back.  The front office was rude and unwilling to help.  long wait almost every time.  I had blood work drawn and specified where to send it so my insurance would cover it.  They sent it to wrong lab.  Then they coded my lab wrong when they billed it and my insurance company denied it.  This happened on two instances.  On my last visit was a follow up and Dr Middleton informed me that he was leaving.  We spoke for a few minutes and he wrote N/C (no charge) on the billing statement.  A month later, I receive a bill.  I call billing and get voicemail.  I left message.  A week later I receive a call saying that they are investigating.  A week later, still no response.  I call back to billing and get Voicemail.  I then call back for Office Manager and was told by Stephanie that the manager Sally would return my call.  A week later, still no call.  I call today and ask for manager.  Do not get her but instead I have a staff member tell me that the manager said they were going to write off the invoice.   Horrible facility and I don't recommend anyone using this place.
5 I met Dr. Boothe right after my podiatrist told me that the tendonitis in my foot was so bad it would take about one year to heal.  After a couple of months of consistent treatment I am able to walk normally and am basically pain free.  Dr. Boothe has a wealth of knowledge and knows how to efficiently address medical issues.  The highest recommendation I can give him is trusting him to rehab my son.
5 I've seen many chiropractors throughout my life & Dr. Ryan is hands down one of the best. He is extremely gentle during adjustments & really focuses on whole body wellness instead of just a "wham bam onto the next patient". He takes his time with you & is extremely knowledgable. I started bringing my 3 month old daughter to him, she was having lots of tension from having a lip & tongue tie revision when she was a few weeks old. She's a different baby! She's now able to roll over, lift her head & turn it side-to-side (all things she was unable to do prior to our visits with him). We were so impressed that I started care with him; my back & neck have been feeling GREAT!
5 Took some time finding a place that did custom made orthotics, that went through insurance, and were made without molding. I will reiterate what the other reviewers have said in saying the staff is extremely friendly and helpful.   I was impressed by the meticulous nature in which I was helped in just getting orthotics.   I was referred to Endurance by Runners Den.
1 The doctors do not properly assess illness and use of medication after diagnosed. They don't ask enough questions about the effects of the medications on the patients. I complained about an incident involving a medication and how I wanted to try a different version because the negative side effects were worse than the illness itself but the manager promptly defended the doctor in his decision to make me stay on the medication.
1 Here for an employer sponsored physical. Been waiting over an hour past my appointment time.
1 Had to wait 30 minutes past my appointment times on 2 visits.  These visits were for gyno care.  Was like pulling teeth to get test results in timely manner, had to keep calling and checking to see if things had come in. I have a DCIS cancer history and worry when I don't hear back in a timely manner.  I told them this but it didn't matter one bit.  Office is mismanaged and office drama is displayed in the waiting area for all to hear and see.  Dr. Brass was actually nice and articulate but I had to wait over 2 weeks to get an appointment to go over my test results and then had to ask assistant to bring her back in as she had not gone over my mammo results.  She seems more interested in teaching naturopathic students than attending to patients and making sure that the office is managed well.  I will be needing surgery and I will not be having her do it because I don't think I will be scheduled properly or that medical paperwork will be filed properly, etc.  Have no confidence/trust in their abilities to take care of me before or after a surgery just based on my office visits and their lack of follow through on basic test results.
1 My first visit took over two hours, mostly lots of down time in the waiting room... I was fine with this assuming it was because I was a new patient and it was thorough. On my second visit they had lost my paperwork that had been sent over prior to my appointment and kept me waiting for over an hour and a half after they knew I was fasting. When I incquired about the length of wait time the nurse practicioner rolled her chair into my personal space and got up in my face and said she wouldn't complete my paperwork if I complained anymore. This sent me into a panic attack and feeling very threatened by her. After I reminded her that I have already paid my co pay, been waiting and fasting she decided to complete it and we finished my appointment with the door open  I've never been more bewildered by a medical "professional" and the lack of caring about your patients on so many levels! A simple apology would have gone a long way but I guess they have enough patients...
5 The office has excellent Chiropractic doctors, physical therapist, and massage therapists.  I've been a patient for several years and have been very happy with the treatment for various injuries.  The Drs genuinely  care about your recovery and then maintaining a healthy you.  On top of the excellent medical care, the staff is friendly and able to accommodate last minute appointments.  I definitely recommend BackFit Health and Spine.
5 Andy, the receptionist was very pleasant and helpful. The facility was very clean. I was seen right away, there was no waiting. The customer service was excellent.
5 Dr Jones helped me tremendously many years ago after getting into an auto accident.  All of my headaches went away and I've gone years now with no more back/neck problems and no complaints.  Thank you again Dr. Jones and Arlyss for providing a comfortable fun atmosphere for me. I miss discussing all the new cars on the market that relates to my business. I will stop in and say hi to you one day soon.  Sincerely, Chris Phillips
1 I'm done here for sure. I was prescribed the wrong medication. Medication that aparently isn't even manufactured anymore . Then after calling in for a week I finally got a call back after spending all morning on hold. I then was told the doctor had finally wrote me a prescription for the right medication in which I found out was just a refill for a completely different medication he had already prescribed me. I then found out that not only is the doctor out but I'll have to wait another 4 days for him to get back. What complete negligence. I would strongly advice to stay away!
5 I have been to this place a couple of times - once for my leg and once for my back and I have had amazing experience both the times.  The doctors are really good and they did a thorough assessment. Also they were really patient with me and gave me proper assistance and therapy. Also, they focused on my overall long term health instead of just the temporary relief. I would highly recommend this place.  As someone else said, they are not trendy but functional and won't try to sell you expensive alternative treatments.
1 The only reason I am here is because my PCP joined this practice .  I love my doc, but the front office (3 women) ignored me while I stood there waiting to check in, so I 'm not sure I will be back. The waiting room is small with benches along the windows and lots of back to back chairs.  I have been itchy since I sat down.  My appointment was for 4 pm and I just found out at 4:15 that my doctor still has to see 3 patients ahead of me.  So far I'm not really impressed.  I love Dr. Izenberg but I not happy about this office,
4 People were really nice at the desk, as well as the physician's assistant.  The office was clean. The doctor was actually quite nice - it just took a while for us to be seen.  I think she's the only doctor at the business.    I don't know much - I'm new to Arizona.
5 Excellent health centre, a one stop shop for all your medical needs. The doctors, pharmacist, rehabilitation staff are amazing. Very clean and professions setting, flexible hours and awesome care provided by all. Strongly recommend this health care centre for all your medical needs.
1 In the past, I have dealt with Dr. Ganesh and Dr. MacCollum, both of whom were very good, professional, respectful and courteous. The one star is not for them, but rather for my most recent visits.  My son was seen by Dr. Morris twice for excruciating pain in his feet. She took a set of xrays both times and ordered an MRI the second time. The MRI was a long time coming and I couldn't wait to get the results. Here's where the one star part comes in. I received a call from Dr. Morris' assistant who advised they had received the results of his MRI and asked if I would like to schedule an appointment to go over them with Dr. Morris. At this point, I had already figured out what was wrong with my son, but wanted to double check the MRI was negative just to ensure what we thought was the cause was actually the cause. I explained this to the assistant who informed me, "Dr. Morris does not give MRI results over the phone because it is a HIPAA violation." The problem with this is that I work in the healthcare field and I know for a fact this is not true. I ended the call and called back after I had a chance to think about this and asked the front office girl to speak to a supervisor. She advised she would pass my information on to the supervisor but asked what it was regarding. I advised her I would like to talk to the supervisor regarding this incident. Because if it is just the doctor's policy, that's one thing; however, it is not now, nor has it ever been a HIPAA violation to give lab results over the phone. She stated, "Yes it is." I laughed and told her, "Now I really need to talk to your supervisor because, clearly, your office is misinformed and I'm not going to pay another copay or have my insurance pay for another visit just to be told, again, that she doesn't see anything. If your supervisor would like to show me exactly where, in the law, it states this, I'll be glad to come in at that time; however, I am sure this is wrong and if your office is telling people this just to get them in the door again, that's not clinically appropriate."  She advised she would pass my information to the supervisor who would call me back. I received a call from the supervisor who, apparently, has never had training in customer service in her entire life because she was the rudest, most incapable "supervisor" I have ever had the unpleasant experience of speaking to EVER. I answered the phone and she introduced herself and said she was told I would like to speak to her. I told her I had taken my son there and recently had an MRI for which their office has the results. I further stated I had received a call from the assistant who told me he could not give me the results due to HIPAA law. I told her I am not wanting to take time off work, take my son out of school and go all the way down there again when I have already been there three times, for the doctor to scratch her head and tell me she still doesn't know. I advised I think I figured out what the problem is and that if she would just be so kind as to tell me whether she sees something or it's negative, I can go from there. But, I don't want to go there again if there is nothing to discuss.  The supervisor then told me, "Okay, well, first of all, you've only been here twice. (Whatever. Two times, three times, fifty times, that is not the point.) And it is the doctor's policy to go over the results in person." To which I said, 'Okay, if that's the case then that is fine and THAT is what your staff should be telling people because that is not a HIPAA violation. It has nothing to do with HIPAA and..." She interrupted and told me in a rather snotty tone that she had through the entire conversation that SHE will handle that part but, "Do you want to schedule an appointment or not?"  Let me just say this: I said, several times, that if there is something we need to discuss on the MRI in person, I'll gladly go down there, but if there is nothing on it, she can tell me that on the phone and I will continue to pursue the course of action I had felt was necessary. As I was stating this, she interrupted again to tell me that "yelling" at her was not going to do any good. To which I replied, "I'm not yelling. I'm simply talking to you about this situation." She then said, "I guess that's just your voice then." WTF is wrong with you, lady? First of all, I am a customer who is trying to figure out what to do about a situation that you are making more difficult than it needs to be. SECOND, the bottom line is not whether or not I want to take time off or whether or not I pay a copay or whether or not your staff are incompetent. The point is my son is in pain every single day. He is ten years old and up until four months ago, he was fine. And you can let your incompetent doctor know it was a medication side effect she should have caught. Also, the results were sent to another doc as well who gave me the results ON THE PHONE.
5 Joe and the team are awesome and got my knee and shoulder working great. Sara has been great to work with on my weight loss and my overall health has improved. This has been the real boost I needed to get myself back on track.   My movement is up and weight is down... a good place to be. Thank you to Ignite!!
5 Recently, I had a lot of very drastic life changes. Because of these changes I was not managing my stress levels effectively. I was having problems eating, sleeping, and concentrating. I went and made an appointment with Dr. Meyerowitz to see how to improve my health. I had blood work drawn to test my levels and I was given numerous amounts of materials for my specific problems at the time. This doctor is amazing!!! He is smart, caring, and intelligent. He actually takes the time to explain everything I ask. The entire staff is amazing as well. Every time I call I am greeted pleasantly, which I truly appreciate because I get stressed just making doctor appointments. I am blown away by this caring staff and I hope others that read this will check them out!   P.S. I am feeling great again!!! Woo hoo!!! :D
5 Paul is an excellent RMT. The pressure was just right, he listened to me to understand my needs for the session. I feel great. He really made a difference. Will return!
5 Dr Lundgren is the only guy I will see when I do some serious damage to my low back.  I have herniated the disc 3 times and he has kept me out of surgery each time.  I can't say enough good about the guy and the treatment he provides.  Dr Braun on the pain management side is a guru with a needle.  He did great things with my epidural corticosteroid treatments a couple years ago.  I just recently saw him for cortisone in the elbow.  I was able to work out pain free for the first time in 9 months.    I am very pleased with both of these guys and have no hesitation in recommending them.
1 It is unfortunate that Dr Jeff Banas of Banas Sports Therapy is affiliated with Premier Pain Management; Dr. Banas is organized, effective, and a pleasure to work with.  Premier Pain is not. Waiting time in the office of Premier Pain can be beyond excessive, and no reason, solution, or advice is offered by the front office staff.  Test records are not available in a timely fashion.  In fact, I had an appointment to specifically go over the records, they were not ready, I was rescheduled, AND I was billed for both appointments. When the records were ready, the nurse merely read them to me, word-for-word.  No discussion, no question and answer time.  I could have read them myself at home and saved the cost of the appointment. Billing mistakes are numerous and there are serious communication issues with the billing staff.  Never once did I ever see an actual doctor at Premier Pain; yet, I had testing done and was given prescriptions for medication which I was cautioned not to take every day. I would NEVER return.
4 Decent enough gym at a fair price for a private gym. Gym equipment is good and there are lots of classes and generally it's fine to just turn up without booking in advance if you're looking to go to the evening classes - I'm yet to find anyone who can confidently predict if they'll be able to attend a gym session a week in advance, but from going on a weekday when I had a day off work it seems daytime classes are completely packed when compared to evenings. The AC in the classes has been a bit iffy of late and if I compare it to local authority gyms outside of Edinburgh the overall standard isn't brilliant but then that's not really am entirely fair comparison.  All in all if you're a regular gym goer it's good value for money - especially if you get some sort of discounted membership.
1 I would give them a zero if I could. Went in for a wellness and referral. They instantly told me I could only be seen for one thing. I had to choose having my ear looked at over a mammogram. Very very very unprofessional with treating clients.
1 Waited an hour and still didn't see the Dr. Really bad management. I've never seen a doctor office ran this way and I hope to never again.
5 Clean environment with up to date equipment. Girls at the front were pleasant and very helpful. Nelly and John were very helpful and knowledgeable. They were able to answer every question I had with detailed answers.They helped me get back to where I wanted to be. I kept up with everything they taught me and haven't had problems since I left. I would recommend this place to everyone. If I ever need any more physical therapy I will definitely come back here.
5 I can only think of Kind words to say about every Human in this building they care so much for others. They all Truly have Hearts of Gold and Karen is Absolutely Amazing  she not only cares for just her Patients but the Community as well.  My son was Dx with Brain Cancer of 2014 and no questions asked her entire office made a Special Day to Honor Benji "Warrior Wednesdays" they all wore his T-Shirts during his Treatment and we are Forever Grateful. Even before Treatment she Sponsored our Local Cheer Squad, and she always caters to her Patients almost like a Mama Kind of Love  we will always have a Place if and when we are hurting because they can always make it better. Its more then a Community kind of Therapy Office our Barber & 49er Club members even see them we are all one Big MML Family!!!  Lots of Love to Everyone at MML and to a Fabulous 2017  #TeamSuperBenji
5 If you need rehab, this is a great place to go... friendly staff that know what they are doing.  They helped me get full movement back after hand surgery and now I'm going to see them for another injury.  They work with all kinds of athletes and injuries... There is always a lot going on in the building, but they manage to treat all of their clients in a timely  manner and have great customer service!
5 Dr Ngo provided exceptional service and  has the best interest on her patients. Her chiropractic services provided relief for my back and neck where I have the most issues due to sitting in the office.  Dr. Ngo is not only here to assist in the recovery but provides ongoing check ups to make sure you are on track to getting back on track. Her exceptional attention to detail and friendly service made me comfortable. She is professional but you can sense the feeling of her trying to know you with casual conversation. Would recommend any day!
1 I have been going to Kachina since 1998.  Since that time, I have seen two doctors leave the practice, including Rebecca Moran.  I made an appointment a few months ago, and the staff was completely rude to me.  They insisted I tell them what it was about, refused to let me speak to a doctor for advice, and when I finally was "allowed" to speak to the doctor, I was told that they were too busy to return my calls during business hours.  Are you serious?  What if your mechanic told you that they would only speak to you after their shift was over, even if you dropped off your car at 8am?  This is the worst practice in my opinion, and it just keeps going downhill.  I would avoid it like the plague.  It is very impersonal, and they treat you like cattle.
5 My experience with this business was 5 stars all the way from the time I entered the business until I left.  This was the most easiest and fastest Pet Scan I have ever had done.We were greeted by Amanda,who was our receptionist as we entered the office. She was very pleasant and knowledgeable of her job,which made the paperwork fast and easy. We had a few questions about my power port and she answered them without any troubles. After a few minutes there  I was escorted  to the pet scan room by technician Jeremy J. He was also very professional and knowledgeable of his job. He was able to use a needle on me with out me very even feeling it,then he gave me my pet scan meds for the testing through the needle that he inserted into my left arm. The test went fast and the work areas were kept very clean and tidy. Matter of fact the whole office was clean tidy,and very professional ,which made my visit there for my testing,a 5 star experience!!!
1 Went to clinic with a small stubborn wart that I was told required two treatments.  After several treatments for other developing warts on the sole of my foot that I could not see, i was also prescribed orthotics.  The first time I wore the orthotics I broke my foot. Dr. Marz said it was fine to wear them in ballet flats like she wore but the doctor at the hospital that treated my broken foot said ths was bad advice.  When I went back after I broke my foot, Dr. Marz stuck by her claim that orthotics could be worn with ballet flasts.  I will not go back there as I feel that although Dr. Marz is very nice she does not give the best advice.
5 I was in need of a new PCP due to insurance change.  Thankfully I found Dr Fereidouni, MD  and Kim Brabentz, PA!  My first visit was with Dr Fereidouni and he was so kind, knowledgeable, and didn't rush through the appointment.  After being his patient for a few years now I can say he is still that caring, informative doctor that doesn't rush through your appointment.  My mom sees Dr Fereidouni and Kim Brabentz for her diabetes care as well.  It's great that she can go to one place for her diabetes and to treat an infection.  I have also had the pleasure of seeing Kim Brabentz... she is so sweet and very knowledgeable, informative, and doesn't rush either.  My daughters are 14 & 16 and see Kim.  They absolutely love her.   The front office staff and nurses are great.  It's nice to walk into a place and feel welcome.  Always smiles on their faces and very professional.   The times I have been there the wait time is little to none.  That's a huge plus! Aveon Health is a great place to try if you are in need of a PCP.
1 BEWARE OF SCAM and TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!   I had scheduled an appointment during the 'off-peak' hours where the price of a consultation was supposed to be cheaper (only $25). However when I went to pay, they charged me the full price and stated that they had recently changed the hours but not updated their website. TALK ABOUT FALSE ADVERTISING!   When I showed them (on my phone) that the price and time on their website still showed that I warranted a deal, they refused to offer it to me! Not about the money - but about the principle!   Furthermore, the manager refused to come and talk to me even though she was in her office and instead made the poor receptionist deal with the situation.   DO NOT WASTE TIME WITH THIS PLACE!
1 The doctor was very nice but the office staff, aside from the women who takes your blood, is incompetent. I was told they took my insurance on my first appointment and on my second was told they do not. I was unable to speak with the Doctor about my results. This was a waste of my time and not good for my health. I'm left to interpret my own blood results! Ridiculous!!
3 I came here yesterday for my prescription and they don't have my medication. Told me to come back today. I came in and asked about my medication. The guy at window 3 which is pick up didn't want to help and said grab a ticket before they can talk. How rude!
5 Dr Buroff is the best doctor in the valley a truly great doctor who honestly cares for his patients. My entire family have been coming here for over 15 years no other doctors can get near his professionalism and demeanor. I salute you Dr Buroff you have patients for life.
5 They are amazing here! Dr. Hogan and staff are so nice and there's never a long wait. I have neck and back pain from work and Dr. Hogan fixes me right up. He really cares and takes his time with patients.
2 Ive only ever been to the location on mesa drive.The positive about Coury Fam medicine is they will get you seen same day, return phone calls, and call in prescriptions all in a timely matter. So that is a definite plus. Because of this it does make it a convenient practice. However, it does not make them a good, nor worth it practice to be seen at.  This practice is not worth the advice and treatment you will receive. The providers are not caring, nor do they have a lot of time to listen and actually give helpful solutions.  They can not treat or diagnose anything if your life depended on it, simply because they do not care. So if your truly in need of quality heath care, this is definitely not the practice for you. The staff is not friendly, nor helpful. This practice has been the most unhelpful, frustrating practice and will leave you with little to no help with any problem beyond the common cold . They will refer you elsewhere rather then treating you themselves. This is a practice based on quantity over quality and does not know what it is to give compassionate , quality helpful care.
5 I have been seeing Dr. Nelson at Desert Ridge FP for more than 2 years now. Their offices are so high tech and the staff is so nice. I adore LaCosta, Dr. Nelson's nurse. She is so friendly, and draws blood painlessly :) They instantly send your prescription to the pharmacy, so it's ready and waiting. All of the Doctors and nurses are so knowledgeable and I trust them completely. If you are looking for a new doctor, I highly recommend them.
5 I've been a patient at Kachina family practice for years. Dr. Fischbeck is a great  doctor and always takes the time to understand my issues and concerns at my appointment. He is both personable and humorous. I appreciate his in-depth review of my medical concerns which overall has increased my quality of life over the last few years. When I first came to see him my previous doctor had given me 4 different prescriptions.  Dr. F changed that and really listened to my concerns and was able to reduce this. He is great!
5 I'm currently using Apex for rehab following total knee replacement.  Their facility is state of the art.  The staff is professional, caring, and knowledgeable. And, for good measure, the vibe at Apex is unfailingly positive. It's really fun to go there.  I recommend Apex to anyone looking for the absolute best PT facility in the Valley.
5 Endlich mal ein guter, sympathischer Arzt, der seinen Patienten zuhört und sogar Hausbesuche macht. Nachtrag Oktober 2012: Leider mittlerweile in Ruhestand.  Nachfolger jedoch zu empfehlen.
5 Always on time, friendly service. Dr. Day very thorough and helpful in answering any questions. Highly recommend
1 I have never provided an online review before today, but I feel compelled to share some facts of my visits. I visited this clinic twice, the secretary messed up the times of my appointments for both appointments. When I met the doctor, he seemed nice and understood my situation. The offices are a mess. The doctor actually cleaned the table with hand sanitizer before performing some tests. He cleaned the testing table after removing a lot of junk from it, to include a rubber chicken (I cannot make that up). During my second visit, I asked the Dr if I should be working out. He advised me not to, due to the severity of my injury. He then asked if I needed a doctors note to suspend my gym membership. The doctor offered to write it during my visit. I wasn't sure I needed it, so I passed during that visit. A week or so later I contacted my gym, and the gym confirmed they needed the Dr note. I then called this clinic for the note, and they refused to provide it to me unless I scheduled another Dr visit. I requested the Dr call me and I was told he would not return my call. I finally received two doctor notes in the mail after I had to leave a stern message on their machine (because they rarely answer their phones, but do typically return calls within a week). One note was for the gym, and the other was to me, informing me that the doctor had fired me as his patient. They gave no reason why, but I was not planning on returning to their office anyhow. In conclusion, they may reply saying this review is "bogus", and I'm ok if they do, I know the facts and thought I would share with others.
5 Was able to make an appointment day of quite easily. I had a professional RMT that was great at explaining what he was doing as well as taking some of his own time to explain a few things I could do on my own.  Upon arrival - was offered water and the staff was very courteous.
5 Dr. Forte has been my family doctor for several years.  When my husband, an 83 year old Korean War veteran developed a serious ear infection and was in severe pain, I called Dr. Forte.  She immediately scheduled an emergency appointment and not only treated him, she followed up and referred him to an ENT specialist.  My husband has a heart condition and the pain he was in was truly endangering him. Our gratitude goes out to Dr. Forte and to her staff for their compassion and professionalism in this matter.  As far as these other reviews go, I can only relate our experience with Dr. Forte but after several years, I have not found any of the issues raised by others to have been true for me.  In our case, it would be difficult to ask for better care. She is also my mother's doctor, and for the record, when my mother (now 86 years old) arrived unannounced at the Cheyenne offices two years ago complaining of fatigue, Dr. Forte immediately sent her to Mountainview Hospital. She made calls and a pacemaker was placed in my mother that same night, saving her life.     Thank you Dr. Forte.   Karen and Kent Carmichael
5 I have had nothing but goos experiences at this office. I saw both Parker and George. They really care about their patients and what they do. Being a former healthcare worker myself I can tell you their care is by far the best I've ever had in las vegas. They are thorough and listen to your physical complaints. I've seen several drs trying to obtain a diagnoses and they're the first team of professionals to not throw pills at me and send me on my way. They have ordered all necessary testing and have clear patient care plans. I am a patient for life. I hope they never leave!
5 I am a physician and I sustained a severe injury and required surgery followed by physical therapy. I could have gone to any therapist in town but I knew of Danny and I wanted him to take care of me. The service from Mr Antonino and his staff was incredible. All very knowledgeable, professional and very approachable and kind. I cannot say enough good about these people. They are all top notch. Thanks Danny, I owe you my recovery to a normal life.
2 It's 8:45 pm on a Friday night and my daughter who's never had an asthma attack - ever - suddenly can't breathe. Urgent care is open for another 15 minutes so we rushed out our door and into theirs within 5 minutes.   Once we found the place, I was surprised by how nicely decorated it was. Clean and cheerful. Seemed more like a physicians private practice office than a late night urgent care - it is for this reason I am giving it a star.   I know we walked in at the last minute and I get that they want to go home but I have a little girl that can't breathe!!! They are dead silent - hand me paperwork and honestly didn't say a word. The girl that called us back and took her vitals - equally rude. They both acted so put out. The doctor was very nice - a woman - very sweet to my daughter. This is why they get the second star. She had the breathing treatment and we are on our way in a few minutes. I won't come back - I'd probably go to the ER if I had to choose between the two.
2 This place is too big for its own good.  The biggest issues I can see are that you have to schedule three weeks out to get an appointment and they don't assign you to a therapist, you just go with whoever is working the time of your appointment, so no one has ownership over your progress but yourself.  It is the least personalized PT experience I can imagine.    I've had a script for PT for three months and have had two actual appointments.  My first "appointment" was just meeting with a therapist for him to tell me what we would do on our next appointment.  I waited over an hour for this 15min appointment where the therapist told me I might "just be happier in a wheelchair" [because I would be at full capacity in a wheelchair versus limited as I am] which I thought was totally weird.  On my second appointment, I had an insurance evaluation because there are never open slots within a reasonable return time/you have to schedule three weeks out like I mentioned above.  They didn't get approval in time for my third appointment, so they called me and canceled it, and for my next third appointment, the therapist called out sick, so they canceled.  So it has been almost three months and i've had two actual physical therapy sessions, when I was supposed to have two to three a week.  When I had my actual appointments, they were fine, with the exception of the person helping me going back to my chart over and over saying, "I wonder why he put this [exercise] in for you" and then asking another PT what he thought (like I said, you just get passed around).  But the two people I worked with were nice enough--no complaints about that.  I would definitely say that if your insurance allows it, go somewhere more personalized.
1 Really bad location, they lie to you, they say there is no doctor on site and only a P.A can see you. They also scam you with your insurance saying that the contract is over when in fact there is no problem, because they prefer to get a cash payment.  This is a really bad location, I won't recommend it to anyone !
5 They treat you like family and they call you by your first name.. they don't treat you like a patient they treat you like an actual person.. Terry is an amazing chiropractic and the staff is always friendly.
5 (Replaces an old Yelp review that disappeared for some reason.)  Laura is wonderful!  I was fortunate enough to randomly end up with Laura at a former location and, from the very first visit, I could tell a stark difference in my body.  I have significant issues as a result of a previous injury and Laura took the time to really understand what had happened, what the initial effects were, and what my current complaints were/are.  She then, using a combination of modalities, set about addressing my concerns.    In addition to being a fantastic massage therapist, Laura has amazing energy and is a wealth of knowledge about health and healing - moreover, she's keen to share her knowledge so that others may feel better.    Whether you're looking for serious pain relief or just some relaxation, give Relax Rehab a call - I just can't recommend Laura highly enough!
5 You remember how it used to be when you went to see he doctor, no waiting 2 hours past your appointment time to actually spend a whole 2 minutes with a doctor that doesn't even look up from the chart ?  Well none of that here, an amazing find IMHO, I never thought I would be reviewing a doctor on Yelp, but these people are so good I just had to...Though I really don't want to become the Duke of the place lmao.  Appointment time 3.00pm, into the Doctor comes in at 3.15pm falling over himself apologizing for being late ! Huh, have I entered the twilight zone here ? A doctor saying sorry for being late ? Does this ever happen in Vegas ????  Anyways, we spent probably 45 minutes just discussing issues, then another 45 minutes actually for the physical....A doctor that spends time with his patients...Who the hell came up with this silly idea ?  The following week an x-ray...appointment time 3.00pm, first x-ray taken at 3.02pm..WTF is going on here, x-ray doctor..not a tech but an actual DR walks me through what is happening and why....Seriously, who are these people ? Am I on candid camera (Jackass for those of you bothering to read this that are younger than 40).  But in all seriousness, it is great to find a doctors office that actually seems to value it's patients, and they are full service, all areas of the medical field in one building...No running around town for different tests !
5 I have been going to Dr. Tinlin for at least 10 years.  Dr. Tinlin is a true professional, and he really knows his trade.  I have had chronic neck and back problems due to old injuries and the combination of manipulation, physical therapy, accupuncture etc., I always feel great after a few appointments.  I really like that Dr. Tinlin doesn't use manual manipulation and the he uses the activator instrument.  Also, my entire family have been treated by Dr. Tinlin - including my daughter starting at age 5.  Great results!
5 Brendan and his staff are fantastic! They're patient, they listen, they are professional, compassionate and they know how to make the process of rehabbing an injury as fun as possible. Definitely try the dry needling if Brendan suggests it - I think that's what helped my shoulder injury the most! Try them out! You won't be disappointed! (Especially if you follow their recommendations and stick to the rehab program you're on.)
5 I was referred to Affiliated for a 2+ month  TMJ treatment.  This is a smaller practice that may not have all the "bells and whistles" of some of the larger groups, but what you get here is caring, compassionate, and personalized treatment from Shane and the staff.  Should another injury arise requiring  PT, I would not hesitate to return.
5 This was my first time going to AMRT and it was a really good experience. Yvette was very friendly, and made me feel very comfortable. I've been to other RMTs and they just did a typical structure of how a massage or full body massage should be. What I really like about Yvette was that she is obviously very experienced and knows her stuff exceptionally well. She knows how to treat muscle pains and recommends other options for treating it at home.  She asked me what were my target issues, and was able to focus a lot of time and energy on it as well as massage all the other parts of my body.   The place was very clean and the atmosphere was relaxing. The bathrooms are part of the building down the hall, and that was a bit sketchy looking but I didn't mind that.   I would definitely come back again, in fact I'm going to be making another appointment soon. I just felt bad I didn't have the cash to tip her last time but I'm going to next time I see her.   I definitely recommend anyone who has sore muscles or muscle pain/aches or to just want to have a relaxing time to go to Yvette or AMRT to relieve it.   Thanks Yvette!
1 I just went to the West Clinic for a dermatologist appointment.  It was my first time there, and I think I would probably go back but ONLY if I went to another doctor.  The check-in process was seamless and quick, despite there being a line, so if I were rating on things other than the doctor, it would probably get 5 stars.  But a clinic visit is mostly about the service you receive with the doctor.  I saw Dr. Ann Rosin for a basic check-up.  But I barely saw her.  I believe she was in the room with me for about five minutes.  She made me feel as if I was just another thing on her long list of things-to-do and the quicker she finished my appointment, the more things she could get done.  She didn't even ask if I had any questions before she was on her way out the door.  I literally sat on the table in shock after she left because I couldn't believe things just happened the way they did.  I have been to some bad, rushed doctors, but I have never felt so "un-cared" for.
5 I've been going to this location for two years now. My doctors are amazing. I'm always greeted with a smile when I walk in. I've always been able to get through to someone when I call. My immediate doctors Dr Dzung/Dr Delaney are awesome managing my care. I can also say anytime I needed copies of my file or help understand things Lauren has been patient, caring and luving. Although I may always have chronic back pain knowing I have an amazing team at Innovative Pain Care taking care of me helps. It's hard to find good healthcare in So. Nevada but, I will say I've found the best. I would recommend Innovative Pain Care to everyone that needs pain management.
3 Friendly staff - went the extra mile to call another center for my authorization - the phlebotomist was not successful the first time - in and out in a reasonable amount of time
3 I visit this clinic very often as this is very close to my home, they have good doctors and staff is also friendly, only reason i cannot give this place 5 star is because wait time to see doctor is too much, have to wait couple of hours even if you have reservation. So be prepared to spend your half day.
5 I was referred to Dr. Merhdad Tafreshi after a accident, 3 years ago.  After my first visit, I knew that I had found my primary doctor.  I have never found another person besides my spouse or parents that cares more about my health and well being than Dr. Tafreshi.    I am so fortunate to have found a doctor who listens to me and gives me great advice to treat my medical issues.  Dr. Tafreshi is very efficient and thorough and I know he really cares about my health.  I highly recommend visiting Meadows Medical Group and see Dr. Tafreshi he is a wonderful Doctor and I'm fortunate to have found him.
5 I've been a patient for 5 years and Dr Hirst and his staff have been fantastic. With my occupation, my back and neck wouldn't be the same without seeing AZ Chiropratic!
5 Roxy at the front desk was amazing. Good customer service and personable. 5 stars for her alone. Thanks Roxy for the help getting his medical records.
5 I am no stranger to the Arizona Bone & Joint Specialists (now Ortho Arizona).  I've had a few big surgeries, some less invasive procedures and a lot of physical therapy through this company.  Out of the 6 doctors that have predominately been working there, I've seen 4 of them.  All are skilled and all are confident in their profession and make you feel like you are in good hands.  I would recommend this place wholeheartedly and without hesitation.    I would like to showcase one of the doctors working at this practice as being all of the above with the addition of an amazing personality and patient rapport.  Dr. Brian Shafer is amazing.  Seriously.  He's one of those hard to find doctors that has top notch skills plus an incredibly personable demeanor - super hard to find with doctors at this surgical level of expertise (believe me).  Sidebar note:  I recently took my 19 year old daughter to see him for a recurring knee displacement issue and she just loved him (how many 19 year olds love anyone or anything outside of their age demographic?).  He is worthy of a long drive, a change of office or physician ... he is just that great.
1 Ok its been awhile since I've been here but I was looking at reviews of another doctors office and this place popped back up.   The first time i tried to go here I was sick and called in to see if I could make an appointment. I was surprised when I was told they had an opening that very afternoon so I booked it. After waiting over an hour and a half AFTER my appointment time and AFTER I already paid my co pay I couldn't stand looking at the crowd in the waiting room GROWING and the same people that were there when I arrived also sill there. I walked out and went down the street to Walgreens Clinic and was in and out in under an hour.   About a year later I at the prompting of my wife I went in for a full check up as I really don't like going to doctors I hadn't  had one for many years. I knew the routine and fasted for a blood pull. The waiting room was not so full on this day but again I was made to wait almost 45mins AFTER my appointment time. When I was brought back I mostly dealt with the nurse and when the doctor did come in he mostly scowled at me and told me I needed to lose weight. I informed him I was actually working on that and I was down over thirty pounds so far. He said "You have a loooong way to go" Well thank you doctor... As he was walking back out the door in under five minutes I asked about the blood work. He said I had to come back in the next day. I informed him I had fasted that day and was ready and he simply said "Tomorrow" as the door closed behind him.  I came in the next day for a simple blood draw and guess what?! ANOTHER COPAY and ANOTHER 1hr15min wait.  I got a call almost two weeks after with results.   It's all about billing for these people. Herd them in and slaughter the insurance.    I am still looking for that great doctors office but in the mean time I can get better care at Walgreens than this place.
5 I have been going to Dr. Petula for 8 years!  The fact that she is into whole body health (a former pro body builder) gives her so much credibility in the Natural Homeopathic industry.  She's got a very nice and accomodating staff.  The ones that really strive to get to know you as a person and not just one of the patients.    How many chiro offices do you know that has a workout room, massage therapy, and computerized Pro-Adjustor?
1 This is the closest gym to me which is why I go but Jesus is the place falling apart when it rains the roof leaks and instead of trying to fix it or clean it all you'll see is a wet floor sign and dirty rags covering the pile
5 When I came in for my first visit I was at my breaking point. The pain in my low back/hip had gotten to the point where I was 100% restricted to what I could do. Everyday was a bad day due to my low back/hip pain. I'm only 34 but body felt like I was 80. My greatest fear was being forced to be in a wheel chair before I was 40 :(  After going over my X-rays, we came up with a care plan to get my body performing the way it should be. I've been seeing Dr Schloemp for about 3 weeks now and I have already noticed great improvement! I was able to successfully run 2 miles with no pain. It was an amazing breakthrough for me! I haven't been able to run in years. But yesterday I did and I'm so grateful for the chiropractic care I've been receiving that allowed me to get to that point. I still have a lit of work to do, but I'm so excited for the future. If you have any kind of pain, sever or mild, please go see Dr Schloemp! There's no reason to live with pain.
1 I have gone here over the years, since moving locations and seeing Dr. Sun Jones, I will be finding a new place to go, Dr. Jones is useless! I have been waiting for over two weeks for them to complete a prior auth, and to return a phone call for that matter, because of their lack of ability to do anything I have been without an important medication for 2 weeks! Save yourself the stress and go somewhere else.
1 My first appt went surprisingly well and I was actually quite please and excited to have found an office that i felt comfortable with, however the 3rd time i went back for a recurring problem I felt like i was basically shoved out the door after being with the D.O. for 5 minutes and then when i went back to the front desk to ask about my co-pay for the follow up they were extremely rude! I had to reschedule because the paperwork was not faxed over prior to my appointment which was not my fault and I would have to pay another co-pay when i came back. I wouldn't take my worst enemy here!!
1 I am so severely disappointed in this office that I now have the mental backing to confirm my distrust of most medical practitioners.  I've been having this sharp pain in my arm near my shoulder.  Because it's my left arm, I've been a bit freaked out that it might have something to do with my heart, even though I have no chest pain.  Regardless, I made an appointment for Saturday and explained my symptoms with the expectation that I could get bloodwork done.  My sister, who had also been to this office, informed me that I would need to fast that day or would need to do bloodwork another day.  I get to this office at 8:17 for my 9:00 appointment, fill out all the paperwork and then pay my $25.00 co-pay.  The woman that brought me back to get my height, weight and blood pressure was extremely pleasant, but then I was brought back to a room where a woman named Allison came to attend to me.  Straightaway, she seemed to be incredibly agitated.  I went through my symptoms with her and when she gave me instructions (like when she listened to my heartbeat with her stethoscope) she was very brusque.  If I had to compare the medical industry with something like customer service, I'd say that most people in the medical field should be expected or required to carry a margin of bedside manner.  I had already explained to the woman before Allison that I hadn't been to a doctor in fifteen years and Allison did nothing to squash my lingering fear.  She heightened it.    So, after I was received by the pleasant attitude of Allison, she informed me that bloodwork wasn't done in their office on Saturdays, but she could do an X-Ray.  I had already informed them that my fear was something being wrong with my heart, but you want to do an X-Ray?!  I'm an administrative assistant and even I know that's wrong...and I don't want myself or my insurance to pay for pointless tests.  Furthermore, had the receptionist informed me that bloodwork wasn't done on Saturdays or had there been an office sign stating such, I would have turned and walked away BEFORE paying my co-pay.  So, I paid $25.00 to sit in an office, fill out paperwork for an office that just needs to shred my file and be treated like I'm nothing.  Once again, thanks for this experience!!
1 So I will start off by saying, I used this place when it was under a different company/name and was 90% satisfied with their services. On top of that I understand I went on a busy day (black friday), but as there were only like 5-8 people in front of me I don't believe it should have taken over 3 and a half hours to be seen! Then when I finally am taken back to a room it takes another 20-30 minutes to be seen by a provider... I will say that when the provider came in she was quick and efficient, but then again I had to wait another 15 minutes to get medicine (from their own stash!). I normally wouldn't even leave that bad of a review for the wait, because I understand that Dr.'s office appointments are not all equal; however, when I get a bill from them and it lists the full price of my visit, plus says that I have no insurance, I get pissed. I provided all my insurance information when I was seen, they even ran my copay! Yet they couldn't bother to share this information with their billing department whom I had to call myself to provide my health insurance information. What incompetent staff! I will absolutely never go back and will try and sway people I know from using their services.
5 I have been seeing Dr Milne for over 20 years and I cannot give him enough praise for, not only helping me heal in many instances, but also for teaching me how to keep myself healthy. When I first met him he told me that it was his job to teach me enough about my body so I didn't need to see him often. He has definitely done that. I rarely have to visit him, but so, so appreciate his wisdom, knowledge and desire to help me heal when I do need him. I have read some negative reviews here - some about him not taking insurance and being expensive. In response to that I can only ask, 'how valuable is your health?'. You get what you pay for here. And, regarding his bedside manner - he simply tells it like it is. He is definitely straightforward but I would rather have that any day as opposed to someone beating around the bush or worse, just wanting to push pills on you. And if you are fortunate enough to get to know him a little , you will find he has a great sense of humor. Like I said, I can't say enough positive things about him.
5 I started practicing bikram hot yoga 6 months ago and I have already seen the great benefits of this type of yoga on my health. I used to get tired easily and sometimes felt fatigue. But now I feel much more energetic and I'm highly efficient at work. I also lost  several pounds after practicing bikram hot yoga, although loosing weight is not my primary purpose for the exercise. But it is no doubt an attractive "side benefit" because who does not want to be slimmer? I have been to several bikram hot yoga studios and I found that the Bikram Hot Yoga Tempe is the one which has the most state of art technology and equipment. I mean the studio is amazing! It has a great sound system and a big teacher podium so you can clearly see and hear the instructor no matter at which corner you are. The room is spacious, bright, clean, and well-ventilated. In addition, it has lots of mirrors. I like to be able to see myself from different angles while doing yoga postures so that I can better observe if I have made any improvement. And I did, which made me happy . The instructor at Bikram Hot Yoga Tempe is awesome. She is very professional and encouraging. Before attending class at Bikram Hot Yoga Tempe, I did not notice that my Standing Head To Knee Pose was not very accurate. She corrected me and said that I did very good on all other postures. How wonderful is she in helping me boost up my confidence! If you are thinking about going to bikram hot yoga, I highly recommend the Bikram Hot Yoga Tempe studio. Try it out and I am sure you will not regret.
5 I have been to a lot of chiropractors over the years and these guys are absolutely amazing. That combined with the fascia release was just phenomenal.
5 I've been going to faz for almost 2 years now, and I can attest time and time again that faz is by far one of the best RMTs. He has helped me with back pain due to a MVA, chronic shoulder rotation issues and most recently plantar fascittis! He gets to the root of the cause and works hard at it until it is gone. He's an all around RMT,  focus is what you want it to be.  He is always up to date on the new and improved massage techniques. Thanks faz !
1 I'm not one to post bad reviews but this doctor made me feel absolutely terrible. I got a procedure done on my back called a radio frequency ablation. After the incredibly painful procedure was done, I was in recovery crying from the pain. The doctor came over to me and made me feel awful, saying there's no reason to feel any pain and that I was being dramatic. Mind you, this procedure involved burning the nerve endings off with a searing hit needle in my back, so it would be reasonable that I was in pain. I've never felt so uncomfortable talking to a doctor about my pain, or bed treated so poorly, and would think he would understand, being a pain management specialist. I decided to consult another doctor for my next procedure (the same one), and that doctor said it was completely normal to feel intense pain following the procedure. I am sure the doctor at valley integrated pain is a knowledgable and great doctor to some, but should have been much more understanding that everyone's experience is different, and that some people will feel the pain more than others. A very disappointing experience for me.
5 Doc Phillips is THE MAN!  All the BS complaints below are just a bunch whiners.  "Oh you didn't treat me this way!" or "Oh this person is rude!" blah blah blah.  Well, sorry that the staff hurts your little feelings.  I go to a doctor for physical care.  My relative is 78 and has been under Doc Phillips care for 31 years.  My relative's father and grandfather both died at 68 of heart problems.  When he was 34, he nearly destroyed his spine, so exercise has been very difficult for him and we all know what that means for long-term health and quality of life.  Doc Phillips has not only extended his life but managed to keep the quality of that life at a reasonably high level.  He has a badly leaking value, resulting in congestive heart failure, defib, kidney function down to 30 percent etc.   He was recently in Spring Valley Hospital twice because his fluid levels rose so high he was having difficulty breathing.  The specialists at the hospital did a number of things that seemed to reduce his fluids and sent him home after 5 days, having changed the meds that Doc Phillips had given him.  He returned a week later, same issue; during this stay he began to deteriorate and I feared the end.  Doc Phillips came in after the first few days as attending physician, took over his care, change the meds, and my relative made a miraculous recovery!  In a matter 24 hours!  So all you babies out there (one complained about a staffer having bad breath for God's sake!!) with your hurt little feelings can go find a doc and staff that are going to kiss your ass all you like.  I'd rather bet MY life on Doc Phillips and crew any day.
1 Zero stars. I wouldn't even know where to start with all the issues. I should have known right away this place wasn't going to suffice because my second visit for my wife and I, they had lost her file and called her with results for a test of someone else's that she hadn't even taken. They then insisted my wife was mistaken, forced her to come in, charged her insurance for the visit, and made her pay the co-pay just to then informed her that they made a mistake and replaced her file with someone else's.  They charged me for chiropractic visits that I never attended, charged my insurance nearly $200 and then forced me to pay $45 which ironically is the cash price anyway.  On top of all this, the doctors and staff are unprofessional to a degree that makes you wonder whether or not they're regulated by any outside source or held to any medical facility or staff standard. Filthy office to top it off.
1 Cassandra the receptionist at the front desk was rude and condescending to me when I explained that I attempted on two different occasions to make an appointment. I called during business hrs and when no one answered the phone I received a recording to state my name, telephone number and somebody would return my call. No one did. When I brought this to her attention, she clearly did not like it, and her attitude and demeanor towards me was completely unprofessional and unpleasant. I will no go to care md and will take my business elsewhere and strongly recommend you do the same.
1 Still no word back from them!! Wow great customer service. Beware of the scams and shadiness of this company. Make sure that you talk to someone when cancelling or else you'll be out your money and they will never contact you! Tried calling the other day and of course no one answered.
5 I started seeing Brandon 4 months ago. I came to him with a painful disc issue that was 1 year old, and bilateral shoulder injuries that are 5 years old from weightlifting. After a couple of months of seeing him my back pain is almost non existent. To my surprise my shoulder pain is progressing rapidly as well. I haven't had shoulder relief in 5 years, I've seen numerous physical therapists and orthopedic surgeons and Brandon is the first Dr. that has been able to help progress towards healing. Brandon is extremely knowledgeable with the entire human body, not just the spine. Brandon uses a wide array of treatment including ART and graston technique which I found very effective, along with the exercises and information he has provided me to better myself. If you really want to get better go see Brandon!!
5 Best physical therapy clinic in town! All the therapist and staff are very knowledgeable and will have you feeling better in no time.   The clinic has state of the art equipment and is very clean.   I have been a repeat patient here as I am a very active individual and have injured myself a few times and they have me back in action just after a few visits. If you are looking for a clinic who cares about your health and well being this is the place!
1 Just moved to Phoenix, needed a physical for my insurance company for the new year - only required blood pressure, height, weight and cholesterol.  Dr. Walter Kmiecik not only required me to schedule a follow up visit in order to get the form completed (two office visits for one form) but he ordered every single blood test imaginable which cost me $400 in lab work not required by my insurance company.  Then, to top it off, in the follow up appointment he proceeded to act genuinely disappointed when he found that my health was excellent and he couldnt bilk me for more "medical care" I didn't need.   This is a crooked, dishonest practice and I would not recommend anyone patronizing them, particularly Dr. Walter Kmiecik.
5 Great rehab!!!! The staff is so friendly and very knowledgable. I highly recommend for rehab
1 Stopped my to renew my DOT physical. I arrived and there is about 5 people waiting, no problem. Get checked in and was told it would be about an hour wait. Paid my cash. My blood pressure normally is apx 135/80 FYI. After about an hour & 45 minutes I start noticing that the 5 people ahead of me are gone, and the 10 people who came in after me have gone in & seen the doctor "quack". I start getting mift and go up to check in girl to find out WTH is going on, and they lost my paperwork. After about 20 more minutes they find my paperwork and call me back for the vitals part of the physical and the UA. The first day nurse (if she even was one) didnt know how to take a blood pressure, put the cuff on wrong, and then couldn't read it right. By this point I was so mad my BP was up in the 160s. She then immediately takes a second reading (which is wrong because it could great vessel damage) and it was a little lower. She then tries to weigh me on a little 300 lbs scale. I am upwards of 400 lbs 6'4". I tried to tell her that it would be a waste of both of our times to weigh me because their scale wouldnt hold me. She insisted on weigh me, and I bottomed the thing out. I then proceeded to do the UA, and she couldn't even read the little lithmus paper right. Instead of 1.000 which I have been all my life (and was actually checked 3 days earlier for a pre-employment) she wrote it down as 1000 (which should be dead) but threw the strip in the trash with others in it, before anyone could cross verify it. I then get stuck in a exam room for 2 more hours waiting for their in-house doctor. After wandering around through there maze of hallways I find a nurse eating lunch and ask her WTF is going on. She said the doctor was out on lunch break and should be back in about 20 minutes.  Finally the doctor peaks his head in and I voice my complaints to him regarding the misreadings and demand a refund, which I didn't get. He said there was nothing he could do as he couldnt verify the readings and I was unable to provide another urinalysis sample. What a waste of time. Also filed a complaint against the doctors medical license, the Nevada Medical Board and BBB.
5 Dr. George and his staff are beyond incredible. I have lived in Las Vegas my entire life and have seen various doctors, never really committing to anyone and honestly preferring to just go to a quick care only when I really needed it. We were referred to him by close friends when we were pregnant with our daughter. It wasn't until we met Dr. George that I was actually blown away by a physician. He started off as our pediatrician, but now our entire family, and a lot of our friends and extended family are his patients. He has helped me make my health a priority and believes in preventative care.  His staff is so kind, courteous and helpful. I am a mom to a 16, 5 and 3 year old, so I call the office. A LOT. I'm annoying and I know it, but they never make me feel like I am to them. I am grateful for each of them. If for some reason you need to be seen by any type of specialist, his staff calls and sets the appointments for you. They make my life easier. He has someone on site that does blood work, so no need to have to go anywhere else. The office is clean and comfortable. Dr. George genuinely cares for his patients. He is funny, kind, and invested with our community. He takes his time with us and never rushes us out and has even had conversations with my oldest daughter on the importance of college and staying focused. He is just the best. I can't say enough. Besides him just being a really cool guy, who I trust, he goes way above and beyond. I know I can email him and he responds, and he has even taken the time to call me ON A SATURDAY to personally check on my youngest daughter. I hung up the phone and cried because I just couldn't get over the level of care he has in his heart for people. He's a gem and I am thankful that he is in our families live for the last five years.
1 Dr. Shi is very condescending & uninvolving indeed! I had this feeling when she saw my daughter for the first time. After a year of not seeing her, my daughter had to come in for an urgent appointment.  She was the only one available, I had no choice. And things haven't changed. I didn't even disclose that I was a nurse. It seem like not acting clueless sets her off & she gets on that obnoxious mode. Never going back!
1 Long wait even with appointment - terrible scam for refills on heartburn meds - crowded waiting rooms - overbooked - terrible management - it's like a poorly run factory - Staff is very nice though !
2 Long wait just to get a shoot, been waiting over 35 min and many clients came after me being help.  Last week I call for a referral to a specialist never receive a call back. Things here are going from bad to worst it's evident no sense of urgency. Beware some test are not cover by insurance just paid over $150 for testing that was not even covered by the physician
5 This place was AWESOME! Dr. Agapay was very professional and took really good care of me as a patient. He took the time to explain everything in a way I could understand and included me in the decision process. Very down to earth doctor! I would def recommend going to see him for your GI needs. He also does other general surgeries! All around, great Doctor!
5 When I first moved to Arizona, I went and had 'interviewing' appointments with a couple different PCPs.  I wanted to make sure I was getting a dr who would see me as a patient and also really listen to me.  I also need someone to see the whole picture and not one off symptoms.  I realize in this office you see a NP very often instead of a doctor, but I could care less.  Ariel is one of the best NPs or DR that I have ever had.  My first visit I knew I had found my office, she has a great sense of humor, remembers what you talked about before (or at least writes it down and remembers to look at it), she is an amazing advocate for you and will really work with you to come up with solutions for long term medical issues.  I am so thankful I found her and this office, I have never waited for my appointment and have never felt rushed by anyone.
5 Yesterday i got a call from daycare that my son was in hysterics because his ear hurt. I called and was told to come down and they would work us into Dr. Brewster's schedule. My little guy was cried all the way to the office, while checking in and waiting. We did not wait longer than 5 minutes before getting called which was probably a relief to everyone in the waiting room lol. Dr. Brewster was personable, gentle and kind during my son's exam. He even chuckled when my son self diagnosed an ear infection. (He was right btw)
1 This doctor is very sweet and I loved when she was located at A Womans Place. The experience I had with her receptionist today was less than pleasant.  I called to make an appointment for my yearly. I know about when it is because, a lot of girls in our office use Dr. Docasar. I called and the receptionist said I had made an apt a year ago when I went in for the yearly in 2014, February 2014.   I said well I should have received a call or email reminder. That is a year out so I was instructed at that time if I made an apt I could move it around if need be and that I would receive a call.   A call was never made. The receptionist states "My notes show a call was made so the fee is owed". I said I could bring my phone records and my call logs and that said call was indeed never made. I also said I will like to come in and make an apt and she said well at that time you will owe the $50 and I said again please let me bring in my records or lets discuss this at my arrive.   She then says she is going to call billing and let me know what they can do then says thanks and hang up.   No apt was ever made even though that was the reason I called, Just like no call was made even though the "notes" state one was.
1 This place is ALWAY over packed all hours of the day besides Sunday, and you could NEVER get a complete workout without someone consistently saying, "Are you almost done with your set?" Also, to cancel they charge you an additional amount plus your regular monthly dues so you end up paying around 45$ to cancel. In the end, ITS NOT WORTH IT. Go to LVAC, much bigger and not so much of a headache.
5 Today was our 1st visit to PT for my son who had recent knee surgery. From beginning to end of our visit, we had a very pleasant experience. We were unsure of how everything would go, timing activity appointments etc. The whole staff was very knowledgeable and answered the many questions we had. They explained everything they were doing and made us feel at extreme ease. I would highly recommend this location. Gabe is our PT and he is excellent!!
5 I can't rate this place highly enough.  I've been to tons of physical therapists over the years (I have always been injuring myself from sports), and Kyle is one of the best.  He took a detailed history of my hip pain.  I'd had the hip pain for years (maybe 8 years), and he mostly fixed it in 6 months.  I originally saw Dr. Rogerson who did an x-ray and concluded I needed hip resurfacing surgery.  That didn't fly with me because although I had hip pain, I was planning to climb Mt. Kilimanjaro in 10 months, and I couldn't be out of commission in recovery from surgery when I was training.  I got a second opinion at the UW Health Sports Medicine Clinic (I think I saw Dr. Wilson) who diagnosed a labral tear and iliopsoas tendonitis and then prescribed physical therapy.  The physical therapy with Kyle allowed me to avoid surgery (which was a stupid suggestion anyway) and climb my mountain in great shape.  Kyle gave me exercises to do at home, and although I haven't been absolutely perfect about doing them every day, I've been doing them enough to keep my hip in good condition.  I can't believe that my hip is in such great condition after having so much pain for 8 years.  I knew I had to figure this out before going to Kilimanjaro, and I'm so glad I found Kyle at Sport and Spine PT!  One final note about how great Kyle is - most of the other sports medicine doctors and physical therapists that I've seen over the years have told me that my abdominal muscles are weak which is absolute hog wash.  I'm very muscular all over, including my abdomen.  He did not say any of this kind of garbage, and instead fixed my hip with a combination of resistance exercises, movement exercises where he maneuvered my hip into different positions, and running on an anti-gravity treadmill.
5 Ive been dealing with balance issues for some time and this place is helping me with that. I can't wait to feel better.    doctors are wonderful here. Receptionist are wonderful to deal with and making appointments.
5 I signed up for Yelp specifically to offer a review of this studio. Unfortunately, I live a bit far to commute (currently residing in Davis, California) but when I visit a certain someone I get excited about getting to practice at such a high quality space for sweat. After the yogahigh wore off the second time, I found myself finding pause, wondering what was so different... and then I realized: This place does not smell like a hot yoga studio, let alone a "Bikram hot" yoga studio. And I have visited my fair share of both at this point in my practice.   I certainly have a love/hate relationship with practicing Bikram yoga,  when it comes to the mind over matter process of maintaining an even breathing pattern despite the elements. At times, the suffocating, malodorous air, so thick it should hold you up in some of the postures, has more than once solicited my fantasies of grabbing mat and sprinting to the door (good luck getting out).  This said, it is absolutely gripping how much stronger I felt, focused, calm, meditative during my practice at this studio. There are enough other elements in the room that you can "toughen up to" that I appreciate beyond simple words how much effort and money is extended to maintain an odor neutral, clean, welcoming, sanitary, and pleasing yoga studio for their students.   Reba is amazing. And I am not just being biased because she shares a name with my mom. During other visits to the studio through the last year I have noticed how much time, and discreet attention is offered to beginners in various stages of their strength and flexibility as they find "their" posture. I have learned more at this Bikram studio than any  others I have laid at mat in. I only wish I could take all my friends, colleagues and coworkers here to begin their journey...
5 After going to another PT spot (Close Physical Therapy) I found Orthosport Physical Therapy.  Jeff made time to eval me on a day his schedule was already full.  Chris, the outgoing assistant, started me on an exercise regiment.  Jeff was upfront that I would get better but 1) plan to work hard and 2) plan to be there at least an hour and a half every visit.  He's not kidding.  My normal visits are about 2 hours with Chris supervising exercises.  Jeff (and the other PT Tony) make sure they are involved with the stretching of each of their patients every trip.  The office girls Ellen and Alicia have been very accomodating with scheduling and with collecting copays on a weekly bases.  They also let me know right away if we do not have authorization for a visit so we can cancel.  While it has been a long process to come back from an accident, the support that I get from Orthosport is second to none!
5 Aneesh Joseph is truly one of the best massage therapists out there... besides being so experienced and professional, he truly cares about his clients, and seeks to individualize your treatments... several years ago I moved to Toronto from Western Canada, and began to look for a massage therapist.  I tried a number of different clinics, and did not have a great experience in most of them... I came across Aneesh Joseph, and after the first treatment, I knew that he was a massage therapist that would be consistent, professional and caring.  I highly recommend him.
1 Do not go to this office! They schedule their appointments in fifteen-minute increments, even for new patients. In order to keep their schedule, you are only allowed to discuss two things with the doc or Lara Leal. This is ridiculous! How can a doc get the whole picture of a person when you can only talk about two things at a time. Due to this policy, we were only able to talk about my daughter's headaches and one other thing not including stomach aches, vomiting, etc. And to add insult to injury, you, the patient are required to be at the office fifteen minutes BEFORE your appointment.  After barely talking to my daughter and me, Lara Leal sent us out the door with a prescription for migraines and ordered an MRI. This is one the things that is wrong with our healthcare system! Rather than just talking to my daughter, Lara Leal ordered a very expensive procedure (the MRI) and sent us on our way. We filled the prescription, my daughter took one pill and soon after was in terrible pain. She said she felt like her head was going to blow up. I debated taking her to the ER but did not, and both she and I had a very long night with fitful bouts of sleep. The minute the office opened in the morning, I called Lara Leal but was not able to speak to her so left a message telling the receptionist who said she would tell Lara about what had happened with the medication and asking for help. No call came back from the office until nearly 5:00 pm. And the message was to tell my daughter to discontinue use of the medicine. Yes, I knew that. Thanks for the advice. I would not take my cats here let alone my daughter. I will second other folks who wrote reviews of this office, stay away!
5 Can confirm: best massage ever.   After a hellish week, my back was in such discomfort that no position was relieving any pain.  I keep my stress in my mid-upper back and my neck, and definitely under my shoulder blades.  I haven't found a regular massage therapist since moving to the valley because it's simply hard for me to find one that will really "get in there".  After a horrible night's sleep I decided that I needed to get any massage, anywhere, as soon as possible.  I found Elements listed as one of the top 10 places in Scottsdale and they're about 10 minutes south of my home.  Though their website is incredibly informative and allows you to book online, having never been there before I wanted to call first to see who would best "work" for me.  Marie helped me over the phone and I described to her what I was looking for- essentially pain/stress therapy and manipulation of my body so that the deep muscles could be reached.  She recommended that I do a session with Zeke and was able to get me in within the hour.  I booked a 90 minute appointment (truly an hour is never long enough, as it takes about 20-30 minutes for your muscles to even warm up so you only end up with a 20 minute actual massage.  The lobby was very comfortable, all of the staff I interacted with was welcoming.  The massage room was just as comfortable and Zeke was welcoming and very professional.  I absolutely recommend a massage from him for those really deep tight spots that you can't seem to ever get.  He took the time to listen to me about my problem areas and really focused on them well.  Overall, I think I finally found my new "go to" therapist.  They do also have a monthly membership program; you can choose to be billed for an hour, 90 min, or 2 hr session every month, recurring and then schedule your appointment accordingly.  This is nice because if you don't happen to use it you can also gift it to one other family member and you get a discount of $30 off their normal prices.  All of the therapists discuss their styles on the Elements website so be sure to read about that or simply call in and be recommended a therapist.  I'm sure that you will not be disappointed.
2 I'd been with these guys since 2008, and their service has their ups and downs. The front desk staff/phones are cold and uncaring.  Jon (val vista) use to be really great but now is overly rushed and short with patients. Dr. Scott(val vista) is by far my favorite from all the offices he's rushed but if you have questions or concerns he'll take the time to answer them, same with Dr. David (chandler) but he is constantly booked weeks out to be seen. Anne(chandler) is nice and normally very friendly but sometimes can be cold and rushed.  Ever since they opened up to a lot more ins their service has been rushed in office and long wait times on the phones.
5 Every time I walk in here, the front desk employees are always greeting me with a huge welcoming Hi! That's not even the best part. The Physical Therapists at this location in Tempe are incredible. I have been working with Matt & Jordan & both of them are extraordinary! It's like magic every single time. I leave this place feeling like i'm a new man. Best place ever!! Thanks for getting me back on my feet. LITERALLY haha!
5 I have been seeing Ken now for a few weeks for my herniated disc & he has helped me tremendously where others have failed. I am not one for long winded reviews so to put it short Ken can help you if you are in pain.  Go see him & book appointments early as he is a very busy man. Thanks Ken!
2 Positive:  The machines were great for cardio with your own TV and fan built in to keep you cool. The staff is pretty nice for the most part.   Negative: I had a Groupon to try it out and the 2 free personal training sessions are not actual personal training sessions - they are the typical session you get for free when joining any gym.  Very misleading.  The change rooms are small and kind of gross.   The layout is inconvenient.   A gym is a gym, but it does not have the professional atmosphere of some of the larger gyms.
5 In a metropolitan area with many, qualified RMTs, I am pleased to be a client of Irina Marukhnyak. She is a calm, good-humoured professional who responded to the issues I presented in a thoughtful, productive manner. Interested in learning what my goals were, she developed a treatment plan that addressed them in a manner that made sense. There has never been a moment that I didn't understand why certain patterns of therapy were being undertaken, and my questions have always been answered in detail. My health has improved because of my work with her. I could not be more pleased.
5 Hi, Sean Early is a brilliant Physical Therapist and I'm grateful for his instruction and care.  December 11, 2015 I, a 63 year old male, dropped backward off a 9 foot wall while cleaning an infinity edge pool.  Fortunately my right ankle was the only serious injury, a tri maluolar fracture.  Great surgery, immediately performed by Dr.Grondel at Saint Rose hospital.  When the cast came off 4 months later he recommended three physical therapists. I visited each clinic.  I was immediately impressed with Seans facility.  It was orderly, clean and had new equipment.  The ambiance is good with a lot  of natural light, air conditioning and 70s rock Music.  Also I noticed their was a light patient load, No assistants will work with you just qualified PTs, Sean and Al. I came into the facility, on crutches  wondering if I would be able to return to my job.  But with three days a week instruction and manipulation plus positive encouragement, left 6 weeks later ready to go back to work. Sean, very like able, is all business but with your wellness and goals always in mind. Al will talk sports and laugh with you.  They are a great team. They teach you a routine of exercises you go through then they massage and manipulate your injury.  Several times to relieve my pain, after a hard workout the used acupuncture.  It works. I will always be greatful for their instruction and care.  I am pain free and have been back to work for 7 months now.  This is the place that will help you on your journey to wellness. Cheers
5 I love, love, love this place.  To be honest, this is my second time at a yoga studio, first time doing Bikram yoga so I'm going to frankly say I don't really have much to compare it with, but it has definitely made a great impression so far.  For any first-timers like me out there, each Bikram yoga class is 90 minutes long, a series of 26 poses, in a controlled 106 degree room (any regulars, feel free to correct me if I've mixed up the details).  And during these 90 minutes, you will ache from using all those muscles you never knew existed, and oh my god will you sweat.  They are not kidding when they tell you not to wear cotton.  I wore cotton yoga pants on my first class, and in my defense I had thought to myself, they're called yoga pants for a reason, so they'd be perfect, but nope, ditch the cotton.  And ditch the pants - by that, I mean wear shorts.  Girls, sports bras are great.  Guys, shirt or no, that's up to you - but if you're hot, (ha! pun intended) no shirt's cool.  ;)  As for the studio itself, the staff are great.  Really friendly, great vibe, and the instructors are very personable, extremely helpful, and always make it a point to walk around to correct your form if necessary, so no worries there!  There are huge wall-to-wall mirrors on two walls of the room, making it great for you to watch out for your own form as well as your profile.  The "classroom" is very spacious, easily fitting 40-50 people on a busy day, but it does get pretty humid during those classes.  So what makes me love this place?  You will definitely work up a sweat, you're all limbered up by the end of class, they have a great schedule and offer classes at pretty much all times of the day (so you don't have an excuse to miss class), they rent towels and yoga mats for $2 and sell a variety of drinks.  Basically, it's hard for you to tell yourself you're not gonna go for class even if you're in the area and didn't bring your mat or towel.  Perfect if you're like me and having trouble sticking to my New Year's Resolution to work out more...  Oh and if you bring 3 friends in, I think they pay $29 for their first month, and you'll get a $25 credit!  Now if only most of my friends didn't live over in West Phoenix...
1 This is absolutely the worst medical practice in the Northwest.  If you think the staff cares about their patients, think again they do not. The staff at the front desk are the absolute worst, this is not an exaggeration.  They all act like snark two year olds. The last time I'm ever coming here, don't waste you time, find a practice that actually cares
5 Great place. But stay away from janelle she's crazy. But I love her she's going to help me walk again  Thank you janelle
5 I have a been a patient of Dr. Chen for several years. He is a top notch physician who cares very well for our family. The office staff is polite and helpful. Wait times are always minimal - I have never been in the waiting room for more ygM 10 minutes.   If you are looking for a local family doctor, ask for Michael Chen.
1 This is when I seriously wish Yelp.com has negative stars!  We were referred by my son's Athletic Trainer to have his hand checked out.  I called to schedule an appointment and the gal took my information and told me since the Occupational Therapist does not work on Tuesday, she'll have to schedule an appointment for Wednesday.  No problem, I said.  What's one more day, right?!  She did say that I'll receive a call later today from another person to confirm my insurance for my son since she does not handle that.  No problem, I said.    Sure enough, I received a call later that afternoon from the rudest person on earth!  When I answered the phone, she said, "This is ____, you called Select Physical Therapy earlier.  What is your question?"  I was baffled.  I said, "I did call but I didn't have any questions.  I already scheduled my son for an appointment."  She then came back, "Yeah, I see that he's scheduled but what's your question?"  Again, I said, "No question... maybe YOU had a question about his insurance?"  Then she said, "Oh -- what's his insurance information?" We went through the logistics and I specifically asked her, "Does he need a referral from his primary?"  The rude lady replied, "No."  "Are you sure because if so, I will call his Primary."  Her response was, "No.  You have a PPO plan so no referral needed."  WONDERFUL!  We hung up and I thought that was the end of it.  I got a call on Wednesday, an hour right before my son's appointment and this RUDE lady called me.  "This is ______ from Select Physical Therapy.  Since we don't have a referral from your son's doctor's office, we are not able to see him this afternoon."  SERIOUSLY?!!!  I was livid!  I said, Why the heck did you not tell me this?!    No good reason except, "Oh, I thought he didn't need a referral."  Wow !  What a friggin' idiot!  She should be fired!
5 Dr. Sara is amazing and the interns at this place are awesome as well! The energy of this facility is very positive and I've made tremendous progress coming here. I've been to numerous physical therapy facilities in the past, but FPC is hands down the best and most effective one I've ever been to. They're incredibly flexible with scheduling, it's easy to make appointments, and they're just awesome overall. Highly recommend!
1 Medieval.    I bought a Groupon for *gross* wart removal.  They imply "latest methods" on their website. THEY BURN THEM WITH AN 80s CAUTERIZER WITHOUT ANESTHETIC**.  And then they offer to pick through the burnt flesh, scraping your charred skin and keep on burning until they are satisfied.    They burn them off -- like they did in the 40s.  BURN THEM.  Not laser, not liquid nitrogen, no technology.  They BURN THEM with the same cauterizing tool they used in the 80s.  No technology there, either.  **I'm allergic to lidocaine.  That's their only anesthetic (for an extra $25, by the way)  They offered ice as a numbing agent - while offering to burn me, pick at the wart and burn it some more.  They give you *many* pages of medical info to fill in - including info generally shared with your OBGYN - really?  The last three pages are illegible photocopy.  Your best guess what the unreadable, single space, full pages of text are meant to convey.  I didn't sign them.  I said no to their kind offer to BURN me with no numbing.  They agreed not to redeem the Groupon.  They redeemed it anyway. Did I mention shady?  And medieval?   I called Groupon and got my money back.    DON'T GO HERE.  EVER.
5 I've had chronic pain in my back and arms and have had trouble finding a great massage that could help with the pain. Fortunately I discovered Proactive Health a few months ago and have received a few great massages from Scott. I always leave feeling rejuvenated, flexible and most importantly pain free. Highly recommended.
5 Took my mom here to get physical therapy after a traumatic brain injury.   Rocky was so kind to my mom. She doesn't speak English very well but he was really patient and kind to her as she explained her issues to him.   He helped her regain her independence, gave her more confidence when she walked, helped with an inner ear imbalance and made her feel safe as he did it.   I really appreciate all the care she received from the staff here.  I'd highly recommend coming here if you need physical therapy. Go see Dr. Scott and his wonderful staff!
5 I was really nervous about having surgery I had to have a total hysterectomy my doctor ..doctor Fleury was a wonderful doctor as well my nurses Megan Abby and Deb are all wonderful and helpeful I'm so happy I chose this facility regardless to what some of the reviews say it's a wonderful place I would recommend them to anyone
5 Staff and Dr. very good... Never a long wait,very organized, helpful, Everybody there take there time to help and listen. Best Dr. Office
1 I really felt like I was getting scammed. Staff and office were nice. Really felt like all they were trying to do was have patients get a lot of unnecessary work. They use this laser, which studies have shown can be helpful when used with physical exams and xrays, but they pretty much only used the laser. When you haven't had more than 1 cavity in the last 15 years and a new dentist says you have cavities in over half your teeth, I get doubtful. Will not be going back.
5 Connie in Dr Cunningham's office has been so much help to me over the last few years.  She is always very pleasant and helpful in every way, she is truly an asset to Dr C's office. Connie Wagner
1 front desk staff is beyond incompetent and rude.  never experienced worse service and a more disorganized staff.   dr. martin is good but all and all your experience will be terrible going to this place and having to deal with this institute.
1 It is horrible. I can't really add anything to the other reviews, because they have covered it all. I brought my wife home after one day. A "1" is a generous rating, but there isn't a zero available.
5 I have been with doctor Reeder for several years as my general practitioner. He always takes the time to listen to and address any concerns. If your looking for a new Doc I would strongly recommend him.
5 As a visitor here, you can tell they care. My uncle goes here and due to his condition I drive him. He likes it and he's very picky. He's an old assho** to be honest, but he likes this place and that says alot
5 The short version is that I couldn't function without AZ Chiropractic. I've only had a massage and spinal alignment here but they are so wonderful. Speaking of wonderful so are the people, they are friendly and helpful and if I need to come in when I'm not scheduled they can usually accommodate me.
1 The worse doctor and staff I have ever dealt with. God help you if you need a call back or even worse if you need a referral. If you have an HMO find another primary care doctor and save yourself the anxiety and frustration. It's like he's being paid by the insurance company to ignore you
5 I have known Dr. Bakty for over five years now and I can honestly say that she is in the right profession.  Her compassion and positive energy make her a pleasure for people to be around. Additionally her passion for the medical field is obvious so as a patient you won't have to worry about working with a doctor who is just going through the motions.   Dr. Bakty has been a wealth of knowledge for me when it comes to daily supplements as well as recovering from sports related injuries.  I would have no problem recommending her to anyone in need of medical attention.  She is easy to talk with and a great listener. I'm sure that all of her patients would agree that she is an exceptional doctor.
5 My mom recently fell and cracked her pelvis. Ethan was extremely helpful in getting her the services she needs to get her back on her feet. Thank You so much for all the help you provided.
4 I'm just writing this update because I went to my follow up appointment today at the location on 51st Ave and Baseline, and I must say that I had a much better experience.  Today I saw Delana and she was as sweet and attentive as you can get.  She examined me and told me that if my symptoms do not improve to come back after a week.  The office staff was very polite as well as the assistant staff.  I noticed that Delana had some good reviews, so I requested to see her, and she was exactly the way she was described in the reviews.  I guess it depends on who you see at this place.  Thanks!
5 thank you karen,branden, jonathan and the rest of th staff  for getting me on the road to recovery and put up with my crankiness tami harris
3 Dr Norton is GREAT, and his staff is one of the best, everyone is really sweet and helpful. The only thing that sucks is the wait. They might get you into the back in a hurry, but you wait 45 min to an hour before you see anyone again... Make sure you don't have plans other than your appt for that day cause you'll be in there awhile. Other than that great OB!
1 Very disappointed with the care I was given. After several visits my condition worsened. I asked that the PT call me and he did not. I canceled the rest of my sessions.
1 Worst place ever do not come here crappy front seat service waited 2.5 house short staffed but didn't bother saying anything to us horrible horrible place!!!!!!!!!
5 I couldn't get into my regular doctor for a severe upper respiratory infection and was referred to an urgent care facility. Went to Allied Clinic at 12th St and Glendale and was received warmly and professionally. Dr Wang was great and called in a Rx that was ready when I got to Walgreen's at 16th St. Recommend this urgent care clinic if you can't get into your doc!
5 I've kicked my treatment up a notch and have started doing regular 60 minute craniosacral therapy sessions at Bodyworks for chronic migraine prevention, and can I just say how fantastic it is?   Unlike massage therapy, you leave your clothing on and lie on your back for the entire massage, and the touch is very light and gentle. You definitely don't feel 'beat up' after craniosacral therapy. Most of the touch is centred on the key areas of your spine, skull and sacrum.   I started seeing the owner, Sue, for the therapy and needless to say she is an expert in the field. She's incredibly compassionate and understanding and a great listener. She really seems to be in tune with other people's energy and really has a gift for helping others. Partway through my treatment she went away for maternity leave and I saw Keja in her absence - Keja is equally compassionate and talented, but also funny and very personable. I can't wait to go for my next massage and look forward to my appointment reminder phone call each month with great anticipation!
5 I went to see Dr. Sraow when I developed a knee problem part-way through a coast to coast cycle ride. He diagnosed my Patellar Bursitis immediately and gave me treatment options as well as recommending adjustments to my bicycle set-up. I was back on my bike cycling pain-free and happily eastwards within days. Very friendly, patient and professional manner. I can 100% recommend Dr. Sraow for diagnosis and treatment of sporting injuries.
1 Double check any medications they prescribe you.  After I told them of my side effects I was told to keep taking the medication for another month.  Well it only took 1 more week f the medication to cause permanent damage to my eyes and organs.  I have now had to spend hundreds of dollars on specialists and will have to wear special prism glasses for the rest of my life.  As soon as I canceled all future appointments with them I started to receive bills from them for how much EXTRA my appointments cost.  So they charge me extra to not even get to see a doctor and have my quality of life lowered even further then it was before.  DOUBLE CHECK EVERYTHING THEY SAY OR ASK YOU TO DO!
5 Stopped in first time today for an ear infection - in and out in under 20 minutes with no wait.  Will highly recommend and use again
5 I switched to this office and I enjoyed how thorough both Ana and Paul were. They were patient and spent as much time as I needed to give me the piece of mind I needed. I would recommend this doctor to anyone.
5 Dr. Docasar has been my physician for many years. She treats my daughters as well.  It's like having a doctor in the family. Not only is she kind, personable, and compassionate, she has a true acumen for medicine and the art of healing.  No matter what the problem she will always listen and work with us to find solutions. I can't say enough about her staff, I love those girls!
1 Do not go here. My family took our father here and were very uninformed about the care he would receive. There is a rife inconsistency and lack of communication among staff. I understand that there need to be policies, they were just inconsistent and unclear on numerous things. The building is very old and walls are paper thin. Overnights are very loud and the nursing staff talk all night long at full volume. There is little concern for the sleep hygiene of patients. The facility seems very understaffed and multitudes of call lights ring incessantly at all hours unanswered. We contacted management twice and were put on hold for an hour both times before being able to talk to someone.
5 Chantal is definitely one of the best therapist I've ever had! Found her on Yelp and thought of giving it a try since her clinic is really close to me!  Came in with my tight shoulder this morning and felt absolutely relieved when I leave. It did hurt quite a bit for me, on-and-off but it didn't bother me too much and it actually felt good.   She was very caring too, she kept checking in with me and see if the pressure was ok and made sure I was prepared if she had to put more pressure on my body, I.e. Warming up my muscles   Definitely coming back for her!
1 Old review of Dr. Tinlin: In 2003 I saw Dr. Tinlin twice. There were a few strange things during my initial visit: asking me to change out of yoga pants into a gown for x-rays then  he told me to hop on the table for my exam. I asked if I could change back into my yoga pants and he said no, it would only take a second. He started testing my leg motion while I was in my gown. I had to pull my gown around my thigh so nothing was revealed as he lifted my leg off the table, then the other one. When he asked me to flip over onto my stomach, he, without asking, unbuttoned the lower back of gown and slid his bare hand onto my lower back, just at the tail bone (I had such inflammation that the skin was super hot, my medical doctor had mentioned she could've cook an egg on my back when she went to do cortisone injections, so I could medically MAYBE excuse the skin on skin contact, but it was creepy and he didn't ask or say anything as he was doing it.) He was just generally kind of creepy, but I was in so much pain and hadn't seen a chiropractor before (didn't know what was acceptable, as I wouldn't think anything of it when my female medical doctor felt my skin) and he was referred by a friend (another chiropractor), so I proceeded with a second visit, albeit guardedly. During my second visit, he gave me very tiny (not helpful) adjustments, using some little hammer thing that barely did anything, but made a clicking sound). He did my back and said "Now turn over on your back." as I turned over onto my back, he said "I need to hit you on your pubes." "what?" I asked. "I need to hit you on your pubes." he replied. "uh...my what?...um...I'm totally uncomfortable with this. I'm...I'm...I'm just going to go now." I grabbed my purse and my shoes and walked out, never to return. i said something to the receptionist about how she worked for a creep (I think it was his wife), but I was so embarrassed and he was friends with my boss, so I didn't ever say anything. For that I'm sorry.
2 I went to Backfit with a groupon for a massage.  The massage was average.  The massage room is very close to the gym like room that patents are treated for chiro and physical therapy.  I did not expect a spa like experience but it was distracting during the massage to hear so much noise. The groupon also included xrays and a consultation.   The staff was nice enough but they really go into the sales pitch during the consultation and suggested that I needed 4 months of treatments starting with 4 times per week for a total of $3000 though they would gladly offer a discount if I prepaid upfront.  That seems very suspicious to me as what would happen if I just happened to feel better after 2 months?    I have gone to several chiropractors and physical therapists and do not expect over night results but I have never been 'sold' this way.  I declined their treatment plan and got a referral from my general doctor to a legit Physical Therapist who I have seen twice per week for 3 weeks and feel a huge improvement in my back pain and stiffness. I would also be careful with Backfit as they will run your insurance and say that you are 'covered' but when you try to find the specific therapists listed at BackFit they can not be found (at least under Aetna).  When I asked about this discrepancy Backfit told me to only look under the nurse practitioner's name which I found but I would be leery  submitting PT or chiro claims from a nurse they I would likely never get treatment from.  If you just want an average massage this place is fine but there  are other PT or Chiro offices out there that I suggest you try.
5 Vianca and the lady with her were so friendly and nice. She greeted us with a big smile and immediately offered us water. The couples float was absolutely wonderful.  The room was very clean. The dual showers is a great idea but would like to have more room.  I can definitely say that experiencing it brought us to a whole another level and more connected than ever.  So relaxing and comforting that you can float with your love.  This is place you definitely should not pass. There's no question that we will be back.
5 I was in Scottsdale and was suddenly hit with severe low back pain that went deep into my leg. I had never experienced this pain before after golf and had no idea what to do. While I was talking with some friends they recommended I visit Dr. Myers at Palmer Center.  I called and was able to get an appointment immediately with the doctor staying over her lunch to see me.  Not only was she kind and very detailed with her exam but also offered advice on different things I could do to help prevent further back pains like this.  Her staff did X Rays and found out that I had one leg shorter than the other and would need a heel lift.  I have never been to a place where I had not only the pain fixed but the cause of it as well. Way to go Dr. Myers and Staff! You saved my vacation!
5 I recently moved to Arizona and began working for A Brighter Avenue this summer.  I started supervising a speech-language pathology assistant and highly enjoy it. The staff and kids are inviting and friendly.  It's a fabulous clinic!
5 Great practice.  Very efficient and knowledgable from front desk to medical assistant to the physician.  Very caring and accommodating.
5 I had rotator cuff issues, Dr recommended Welch PT. Guy Welch was up front with me after the evaluation, said he didn't know if he could help or not, after 6 sessions my range of motion improved but I still had pain. He could have kept me coming back and gotten more money. Instead he suggested to go back to the Dr. I had surgery November, Welch did the rehab.   He is priced competitively, doesn't try and keep you coming back to fill his wallet. I am very satisfied with the results. Flexibility and range of motion is within 5% of my other shoulder and I am pain free. Took 16 weeks but he could have kept me longer. I left there with a list of strength building exercise and couldn't be happier with the results.  I would highly recommend this organization! The entire staff is great!!
5 Wow, can you believe there is a doctors office that still exists where they did not ask me for money up front? I was warmly greeted and did not have to show ID or give up my firstborn just to see a doctor, which is the norm these days!!! My 14 year old sustained a knee injury at cheer practice and the first ortho I brought her to would not see her without a $250 payment before she even saw him!!!  We sat in that first office with her crying in pain for 40 min while they haggled over her AIA school insurance.  We were first seen by Dr. Grubers PA, who immediately put my daughter at ease and explained her injury then did a set of xrays.  Dr. Gruber then came in and let us know the course of treatment. Orders were sent out then and there and the nurses were also fabulous!!!  I cannot say enough good things about this office and the way we were treated. Thank you Arizona Bone & Joint Specialists for restoring my faith in the medical profession!!
3 I'd like to start with the doctor saw was great, black hair, New York accent, but the poor woman needs help on a Saturday night!  Came in for an issue with my eye, on a Saturday at midnight.  6 others ahead of me, seemingly non-life threatening.  It is now 3:30, one doctor working on a Saturday night in Vegas
2 Went here for pneumonia. Emergency room dirty and packed. Horrible reception staff. Nurses in ER especially Erin was awesome. Went into IMC/ICU for pneumonia and empyema. Docs inserted a chest tube. Which they did not drain enough and ended up hospitalized again 2 weeks later with a new chest tube at mike o Callaghan hospital (horrible ER awesome ICU care and specialized docs/pulmonoligist). UMC ICU had the worst CNA's (Sally was the worst no respect and careless) and nurses (1 good nurse Teresita she helped when she was assigned to me). They were rude. Esp the fact most were Filipino nurses. I am Filipino and my wife is white as snow. They did not treat her with any respect.  Careless and no care for the pain I was in. Rude, dirty, bad care, bad doctors on decisions to discharge patients when not fully recovered.  Hopefully new president fixes the patient care here.
5 Had the pleasure of meeting Dr Farian and visit the clinic on opening day! Amazing facilities and knowledgeable staff.  Definitely coming here for my family's health needs.
5 Dr. Perez gets 5 gold stars. Our family of five was relocated recently to Scottsdale leaving us to find quality medical services.  With 3 kids ages 18, 16 and 12, it was overwhelming to find a doctor who can help all ages and genders.  Dr. Perez and his staff were extremely helpful, knowledgeable and timely.  All took the time to listen to our needs giving us the quality attention of a private boutique dr but not the boutique price.  Do not hesitate to call this office and take care of your family's medical needs. Probably the BEST care you can get in Scottsdale!
5 While training for my first marathon, I injured my hip and pelvis and ended up at A+ through a referral.  When I first arrived, I was unable to walk normally and without pain, let alone run.  Dr. Dave was able to diagnose my issue right away and immediately developed a plan for my rehabilitation. During my time there, the staff were incredibly efficient, knowledgeable, and focussed on my wellness. Additionally they were a pleasure to be around. Honestly when I was better, I missed going to A+ because the atmosphere there was so friendly it was kind of like your favorite bar where everybody knows you name. Since being treated at A+, I successfully ran my marathon as well as a few half marathons in the meantime and it would not have been possible without their help.
1 My husband was seen by a PA for an injury to his elbow. The PA was fine, he sat about 4 feet across the room from him and watched as he displayed range of motion, ability to bend extend, lift, etc  The physician assistant at no time physically touched him, but to shake his hand on his way in and out of the room.  We have received a bill for $226 for closed treatment without manipulation in addition to his copay. We have contacted their billing department on 4 separate occasions and received multiple conflicting reasons for this bill.  We have left 3 messages with the billing manager and have not been contacted once. We will absolutely be reporting this to our insurance, Medicare, and the better business bureau. I have worked in the medical field since 2007 and this is fraudulent billing. It is clear that they are unashamed of this enough to disregard the courtesy of a phone call to even pretend otherwise.  You will be better off absolutely anywhere else.
5 Ok I'm not sure what the big fuss is about because I have been here 3 times and each time has been great! Me and my husband see 2 different doctors and they are both great to talk to and the assistants are good as well.   They have an on-sight lab so blood can be drawn. Overall coming back and happy to do so!
1 I dont know how this place got as many rave reviews as it has. As of right now, I've been waiting over an hour to see a doctor just to get a simple, unfortunately necessary, prescription filled out. People who have walked in after I have are being taken in, as I sit and wait. When I asked the receptionist a question, I felt as if I'd just asked if the moon was made of cheese - and perhaps my question was that silly, but it still warranted a civil answer. If I hadnt already invested so much time waiting, I would leave.
5 I have been using Dr. Sierra de Aragon's office for about a year now. I am always able to get in for an appointment within a day or two of calling, which is extremely important to me. I rarely wait long in the lobby or exam room. The front office staff is always professional, helpful, and friendly.   I started seeing FNP Paul Kuppinger several months ago, and with his constant encouragement and expertise, we've been managing my health issues as a team. I trust his medicine and really feel like he's personally invested in my health. I would definitely recommend Paul to anyone, until he gets too popular and I have trouble getting appointments with him.
1 New to town with a 9 month old baby, I was wooed by this office's offer of meet & greet appointments, Saturday office hours and their afterhours nurse hotline.  Surprisingly not too many pediatric offices in the Summerlin office seem to offer these services.  But so far we've been here for four appointments and we've waited a minimum of an hour (45 minutes to get into the room then another 15 minutes for the doctor to come in) each time.  Today we waited 90 minutes to be seen and the doctor spent 3 minutes (I kid you not, 3 freakn' minutes!) with my son.  It was INFURIATING to say the least.  I don't know that it's necessarily the doctor's fault but regardless it's unexcusable to keep patients waiting that long.  I've seen both Dr. Laura (Weidenfeld) and Dr. Hwang and the wait times were similar for both doctors.  It's just the way the office is run.  They overbook their appointments and see patients even if they're really late.  So when the doctor finally gets in to see you she's in a hurry because she's behind so she's practically ushering you out the door as you talk/ask your questions.  And the waiting room is a zoo.  Kids running all over the place, touching everything and yelling.  They have a separate area for sick kids but no one enforces the rules.  I've seen plenty parents turn a blind eye as their boogery sick kids run from one side to the other touching everything with their germy hands.  UGH.  I'm just done...DONE with this place.  Your child is likely to catch something from sitting around in the waiting room amongst sick kids for 60+ minutes.  Not worth it.  Go somewhere else.
5 I have been to many doctors and there is no greater place I'd rather be than AZPTC!!  I finially feel heard and know that my care is in the best hands.  The minimally invasive procedures are just that; minimally invasive. The results, however, are far from minimal. Working with the spine is complex and to think the solution to a healthy spine is simple is a silly concept.  That being said, AZPTC knows what they are doing and they have mastered the art of relieving pain as quickly, safe, and effiicently as possible.  Their team of doctor's are the best.  I'd give them a million stars if I could!  Thanks for changing my life!
1 Went here to get a vaccine that I needed after returning from Thailand. I purchased the vaccine for $250 and went to have it administered by the nurse. In the middle of administering the vaccine, the nurse decided to answer his cell phone and spilled the vaccine in the sink. The owner, Dr. Karim Riskallah then promised he would refund my money for the spilled vaccine. After returning to San Francisco where I live, I e-mailed him to inquire about my refund and received a nasty response from him stating he does not feel I am owed a refund. Although the doctor that saw and treated me was very kind and helpful, I would still avoid this place at all costs as the owner, Dr. Karim Riskallah,  is in the business of ripping off patients. You can also find other instances of him ripping off patients online.
1 I've been trying to get my medical records corrected since the summer of 2016. I've never been to a medical office that records incorrect health information and then does nothing to get it corrected. I recommend somewhere else, this place has been a nightmare.
5 Heard a loud pop in my lower back while doing a deadlift.  Rehab plus was recommended to me from a guy that works at Hi Health.  Called in and setup an initial consultation.  Met with Breanna for my initial evaluation and then also for my bi-weekly treatments.  Lots of electrolysis, heat, stretching, messaging, icing, and three weeks later I'm almost back to 100%.  I came a long way from barely being able to walk into the place three weeks earlier.  Just to be clear I was still hitting the gym daily but focusing more on stretches and light cardio just to keep the body moving for the first week or two and then at the end of week two started lifting weights again.    I think Breanna did one heck of a job on my back and the entire staff was pleasant and easy to deal with.  Not to mention the owner is a HAWKEYE.
1 Rude Doctor  Rude staff would not recommend.  Visited on sunday, still sick would not refill prescription for eye infection.  Really how could it hurt if eye is all swollen.  They take your money fine.
5 Dr Fakhouri and Pat along with the nursing staff are exceptional. They always return my calls and work with our schedule to get us in when we need it. I can't say enough good things about them. It's a convenient location and we honestly don't end up waiting too long once we arrive. That's a huge plus for me personally. Have been a patient there for years and will continue to go there. Great job!
5 I have been seeing dr. pingol for over 6 years now and shes amazing. I love that i can do my annual physical and my pap on the same day. The staff is very friendly, The dr. has great bedside manner, which is Vegas is impossible to find. Shes so sweet and patient, I definitely  recommend her.
5 Dr. Christy is a gifted, caring Dr.   I am so fortunate to have been under her care since 2010.  So much has happened!  First she discovered why I was what I called Zombie tired, (I have thyroid issues that 2 GP's had missed) Then she helped me lose 45 lbs.  Oh then there's the cancer scare.  The technician who performed an ultrasound really frightened me & Dr. Christy's staff worked me in to see her that same afternoon.  And that time I was allergic to a new antibiotic - she called from the airport on her way out of town to have her staff check on me before she left.  'Lil 'ole me.  I'm just a casino worker, hardly famous.  So bring on the occasional office wait I don't mind at all, I know when I need her she will be there for me.  As for the price tag, (only my labs are covered by insurance) I will happily skip on frivolous high end items so I can budget for what's important to me because in this Valley a Dr. as through as she is that actually cares about her patients - that's priceless!
1 Make sure you pay attention to the dates of the reviews.  I have been going to WFP for over a decade.  I am now looking elsewhere.  Whether a change in Merle caving to constant Med Ins. impacts or just forgetting why he got into this.  The level of quality and personal interaction has continuously dropped over the years.  I feel that I am treated no differently than someone just walking off the street with zero history with them.  The Docs spend about 5 seconds reviewing the folder before walking in  making comments that my decade long history clearly cover or disprove.   I have recommended them in the past but they are now a shadow of their former self.  It is sad, embarrassing, and extremely frustrating.    Return to the basics and make a difference would be my advice to them.  Not that they ever asked for my feedback or input.  The only difference today is customer service and they have completely lost focus on that. I guess in the end you can't blame them as this is a "for profit" business and they have to make decisions about what is important to them and what gets cut in order to stay in business.
1 I did not like this Urgent Care, and I doubt I'll ever go back.   This place seriously needs to take some customer service lessons from Dignity Health, it's like they have no idea how to treat a sick person. There was no greeting, no smile - they never looked into my eyes once. The main secretary guy greeted me with a "take a seat, don't stand around the front desk, and fill out this paperwork." Never once looked at me, smiled or anything. The doctors and the rest of the staff were like that too. The doctor came in, used is stethoscope on me, and declared that I had a cold flu that had turned ugly and that was all. He gave me some prescriptions for meds and walked out. The whole ordeal, from walking in to walking out was about 30 minutes. It was efficient, but impersonal. When I'm sick, I want to feel confident in my doctor and my diagnosis. I had no idea what the prescriptions were for, what they were going to do, what I was supposed to do if I got worse (which I did), or how this could have been prevented.   Would not reccomend to anyone.
1 These people 1) cannot return phone calls and 2) cannot send paperwork, via snail mail, after promising to do so.  They were highly recommended by my neurosurgeon, and I am still wondering WHY!  No communication/no follow up!
1 Came one week ago to get stitches for my son. Came back to get them removed 7 days later. It took Forever!!! It took 5 min to get initial paperwork then a wait 20 min. Then another round of paperwork, then a other 20 min wait.  When I asked why we had to repeat all the paperwork there was no coherent response. Over  1 hour to get stitches removed (1 min procedure) with only one person ahead of us. I don't recommend this place.  Next time just go to the Dr office.
5 Very pleased with the atmosphere!! Really clean and the place smelled wonderful. Stephanie loves what she does and it shows in her care towards you. She is knowledgeable in essential oils and helps you feel comfortable. The wraps are wonderful. I will have this again. I felt energized after and revived!
1 I was transferred from St Rose De Lima to continue with IV antibiotics treatment to combat a severe foot infection. I arrived at 8.30 pm and after confusion as to which room I had been assigned. This had a bed and TV and Internet that did not work, but no medical equipment such as IV stand or pump  My personal effects were cataloged and then I was told to ring if I needed anything and left to get into bed. My weight was taken twice as the second person had no idea the first staff member I met had already done this.  I called about my medications after 30 minutes as I am diabetic and was also in pain. The nurse call button kept ringing for 40 minutes with NO ONE ever coming to help.  I tried calling the switchboard NO ONE answered.  My called my wife to get her to get in touch with the facility.  She eventually got the supervisor who told her that there was no pharmacy at the facility and that they were unaware of my medication needs, but they could go out and get my medications once received from the hospital.  * I was never asked if I was diabetic  * What I was there for? * What meds did I need or who was my doctor? * Was I in pain?   * NOTHING.    After an hour I called 911 to be returned to St Rose, they told me they would not do so until I had been released by Canyon Vista.  Phone calls to my Insurance company were transferred to a call center in California and they did not know how to help, but said they could email my doctor who would answer 3 days later on Monday.  Eventually the supervisor came to my room to ask me to remain there. I could not agree as I simply didn't feel safe or trusting of their nursing staff, who appear to be low paid CNA's.  I was told that I I went I would lose my place.  If I remained I would lose my foot.  The supervisor told me that my antibiotics were only administered once a day and that i had had mine before arriving at Canyon Vista.  The fact that I had been on two IV drips for over 4 days and that this was supposed to immediately continue escaped her.  The September activity schedule was taped to the back of the door of my room and clearly shows this place s a retired assistive care facility with trips to a casino coffee mornings etc.  In no way should it be remotely described a sub acute treatment facility.The staff are utterly out of their depth medically speaking and obvious overwhelmed due to poor training and staffing.  I left some 3 hours after I had arrived.  If you need a rest home maybe this place will work for you, Other wise AVOID IT.
4 Good sized medical practise, although parking can be at a premium. Good range of different service to suit care needs, GP's good, reception staff friendly. Clean and fairly well organised.
1 My mother was recently a patient at this facility and the treatment was ridiculous.   The employees there are understaffed, undertrained, incompetent, and could care less. The food was so inedible that we had  bring it to her from outside. There were times when she needed assistance but after having her call hutton pushed several times amd beimg ignored for an hour and 20 mins noone came to assist her at all. They do not communicate eith the patient or family about any rehab, treatment, or care plans, needed medications, or follow up appointment schedulings (ortho). The case manager  never answered my calls, returned them, nor "managed" her case, but she definitely knew when her insurance coverage was up...   It was the worst experience my mother has ever had and she couldn't wait to be released. If you care about your loved one and want the to heal and rehab properly, this is NOT the place for them.   I'd give them less stars if i could!!!
4 While I have not actually had a massage here, I did purchase a gift card here and found the front desk very friendly and accommodating. My friend loved the one-hour session she had here and advised me she would be back. She was able to book a massage with a female attendant and was happy with the massage she received, and as the purchaser of the card, that made me happy. I actually chose this location based on the other helpful reviews of my fellow Yelpers :).
1 After being a patient of Dr. Karl's for quite a few years, I'm searching for a new office. Dr. Karl was truly amazing and I'm so sorry that he moved out of state. There is not another doctor in the practice who I feel is competent. Recently, I was put on a medication. When I noticed some adverse side effects a few months later, I requested a change. The PA there didn't have any suggestions for a new medication so I had to make a suggestion. Red flag number one. I was never warned about any side effects or withdrawal symptoms when the medication was discontinued. Within several days, I started experiencing withdrawal symptoms from not having the previous medication and severe side effects from the new one. It took the office several hours to return my phone call. Really shows how much they care. Apparently, Dr. Barreteko told the front office staff that I would be fine until my next appointment, which isn't until the end of the month.  Are you kidding me? I have been experiencing horrible symptoms for the past 6 days now and can get no relief. Fortunately, I was able to get an appointment somewhere else. Otherwise, I'd have to check myself into a hospital. Thanks for nothing, Nevada Family Care! I won't be back.
5 Very helpful and knowledgeable! Didn't feel a single of the 4 shots, Peru here we come!
5 Bought a groupon for 35 dollars which entails an x-ray on the first visit, 2 adjustments and a massage on the 2nd and third visit! which is an amazingly awesome deal!  My mom was in a lot of pain and felt better after the adjustment. Dr. Garrett was very professional and interactive. He taught me what was happening and what's the problem is and how he's going to fix it. If it's out of his capability he will refer her but thanksfully from the x-ray it appears to be muscle-skeletal problem which he's very expert in re-aligning the bones :). Amazing staff and wonderful doctor! Will be investing on insurance that covers this place :).
5 I have seen Dr. Sbaih for several years and have always been impressed by her.  She takes the time to listen and makes the best decisions to keep me safe and healthy.
5 What a great place. This place cares and listens to their patients needs. The Doctor spent about 20 minutes talking to to me and seemed to really care about my health, which is a refreshing change from your typical Doctors visit. If you don't have insurance and need a place to go I would highly recommend Chuys Medical.
5 My first appointment was such a great experience. The staff is very friendly and actually makes you feel welcome....unlike most doctors offices. I'm glad I found them and look forward to being healthy with their support!
1 I have been a patient here for years. When they had one office it was great. Now that they have grown everything about them sucks! I call the number and it sends me to an answering service. They tell me they will contact them and I will get a call. Never happens. I call for refills. Doesn't happen. I had to have another Dr. Call them for me to get my blood pressure med refilled. Going to have to find somebody that seems to give a shit!
5 We loved Dr. Nicole and her staff. There are new Doctors at this location so do not pay attention to the older reviews. Her staff is friendly and helpful. All our questions were answered and all tests run on the same visit. She took the time to answer all our questions. My daughter and I both had appointments with her and she never made us feel rushed to get to other patients.
4 This Review is pertaining to Dr. Clarissa Barrettoko's office. Dr. Barrettoko is A GREAT DOCTOR. Honestly, I've seen many doctors in the past, so I was skeptical when I first went to see her. BUT she is truly a great doctor. She is very enthusiastic about helping others. You can see and feel the positivity. She is a DO not an MD which I think is why her approach to everything is not always medication. Her passion for what she does really DOES make a huge difference. After I moved to California, I went to other doctors... Had some very bad experiences... decided that I am going to have to make a trip to Vegas every once in awhile because I refuse to see any other doctor. She is THE BEST, and no other doctor could even compare..  You're probably wondering why I'm giving it four stars. I had an appointment with the Dr. Barrettoko at 8AM. I knew that I would have some tests that day so I went ahead and didnt eat anything because that's what is required for these tests. (YES, they do blood work in their office place!). I went ahead and told the ladies up front that I am going to do blood work. After my 8am appointment, it was 9am. When I don't eat in the morning, I feel EXTREMELY dizzy. I asked this particular lady in the front how much longer I would have to wait to get my  blood work drawn. She told me 5-10 minutes. When I exit the door, there is about 12 people in the waiting room. I'm assuming for blood.. and I was right. Well 45 minutes later, keep in mind I'm feeling extremely dizzy. I saw that a new patient came in, and waited about five minutes than went to get her blood work drawn. Now at this point, it made me irritated to see this. I went to the front and spoke with the lady named Kim (The women I referenced earlier when she told me it would be a 5-10 minute wait.) I told her that I saw a lady wait about five minutes than proceed to get her blood work drawn, & I was wondering how much more longer it would be till I could get mine done. I said this very nicely. I'm the type of person that would not start a confrontation with anybody. She told me that THAT person had an appointment and THAT's why she went ahead, and I explained to her that I haven't eaten anything and I have been here since 7:45. This is the part that just really shocked me.. She told me in an extremely rude way that I didn't have an appointment to get my blood worked done. THAN SHE asked me if I just WANTED to leave and reschedule later. WOW!! I told her no, I do not want to reschedule I have been waiting for about 50 minutes now for blood work. Keep in mind that there was many people around watching and heard this conversation.  She was extremely loud when she asked me if I wanted to leave. Jeez I just wanted to know how many people were in front of me, not to be bashed at. When I sat back down the person next to me told me that "Kim" is always like that. WOW talk about public humiliation. I'm still very upset that this women was extremely unprofessional and others know that she is as well. I really hope just because of the rude medical assistant up front(They are medical assistants, right?), they will still come back to see Dr. Barrettoko.
1 Very low standard of care here. Do yourself a favor and don't make them your PCP. OK for a quick walk in, but for anything else, they seem forgetful and incompetent and I have filed a formal grievance. I had 2 negative experiences: Chandler and Laveen offices. Both locations were with Nurse Practitioners.
5 Dr. Shloemp is great at what he is doing, my lower back and neck pain has decreased noticeably after being on his care for the last few months. I'm now able to play tennis much longer with less pain. The staff is courteous and helpful. Their office and equipments are all excellent.  Dr. Shloemp aslo is good at listening and addressing all the questions and concerns I raise during visits. I'd say he's the ideal chiropractor you want to care for you.   I also want to mention that their felixibilty with appointments have been very helpful to me to maintain receiving care from them so they get a BIG thumps up for that.
2 Normally I am hardly ever sick. Since I've begun working in the public and being around 200 or more people daily that seems to have drastically changed.  I am no MD, but I know enough and I know what I can take/need for my symptoms. When you go in for Tonsillitis and the doctors want to give you OTC Zyrtec (which they will swear up and down is covered by your insurance, ITS NOT!!)  you know something is just not right. This happened to me. I hate the fact that I have to get a little abrasive with the doctors here to get them to understand that not everyone in Vegas has allergies. Furthermore my tonsils are clearly swollen and there is a white coating on them, PLUS a fever and I have the chills... THAT IS NOT ALLERGIES!   The doctor finally rxd me some Amox and a throat coat, but me having to play good cop bad cop with someone I'm paying is just BS. Really the only reason I go here is because it's close to my apartment somewhat, and they're opened on the weekends at 8am. My son and I both needed to be seen and we got there at 745am, Signed in at 803am (they opened late) and weren't seen until 9am!! We were 3rd on the list! RIDICULOUS!  Prior to this visit I went in for an upper respiratory infection which again they attributed to allergies... and again tried to "prescribe" Zyrtec to me.    Meh, no yay for you!
4 Best doctor's office I've found in Vegas.   I've been to a total of 3 general practitioners in Las Vegas, and it's been hard to find one who seems to really care about my well-being. Finally I went to Dr. Conger at the recommendation of a co-worker, and she has been awesome.  Whatever my complaint, she takes it seriously and runs every necessary test to ensure there's nothing more serious going on.  She also sits down with you and really gives you time to discuss whatever you are there for.   They do many of the tests at the office, so you aren't always trekking across town to get lab work done.   Dr. Conger has also referred me to two specialists, and both have been good.  I like knowing that she isn't just referring me to a friend, as some doctors in Las Vegas do (ahem, Jateko Family Medicine).    I highly recommend Dr. Conger and the Diagnostic Center of Medicine.  The 4-star rating reflects just a few little issues - moderate waiting time, not taking my friend's insurance, and one accidentally deleted appointment.  Over all, though, it's pretty awesome!
1 Very poorly staffed as well very poor service. Just for a pre-employment drug screen. Not a very great ran business at all!!! It's been over  2 1/2 hours. Are you kidding me!! All this just to pee in a cup! Really not ran well at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5 Great staff, knowledgable, takes time to discuss your treatments. I felt a ton better by just the first couple visits! Definitely worth going! They do a great consultation and really explain the treatment best suited for you!
5 Dr. Kristine Lukens is amazing!  I've been in constant pain for a week because of a botched chiropractic visit to another facility.  Unable to move my neck or get any relief from the pain.  Dr. Lukens took my case and in just one visit, she had me smiling and had restored my range of motion.  I'm so happy to have finally found a chiropractor in Las Vegas who knows what she's doing!  Her 25 years of experience is evident in the results her treatment brought me!  I HIGHLY recommend her!
1 I sliced the back of my hand when a wrench slipped so my wife took me this place which is the closest urgent care facility to our house. They couldn't or wouldn't verify our insurance at the visit even when presented with insurance card and ID which oddly enough was valid at my dermatologist a few weeks later. This is a common Blue Cross Blue Shield plan and they never attempted to bill our insurance. When they sent us a bill, which we paid immediately, NOTHING in the long itemized list was coded, which has made getting reimbursed from our insurance impossible. By the way, the bill for four stitches was more than a thousand dollars. The physical wound healed but my wallet still hurts.
5 My oldest son went here until he graduated from pre-k.  I loved SEEK and I was so happy we had found it.  Now that I have a new baby, my 4 month old is in their infant class and I love the school all over again.  The staff is really friendly and always helpful, and the teachers are amazing.  You can tell it isn't just a job to them.  They really bond and love every single baby in that classroom.  I feel so comfortable leaving my new little love there, knowing he is in good hands!
5 Great staff,  great providers, great location!   The docs take the time to listen to your complaints and understand where you are coming from.   I would recommend my family and friends to come here.
5 My son ha been coming here since he was 7 weeks old. Kat and Dan are amazing! He is progressing so well. I don't think he would be where he is now without them. They are knowledgeable about what they are doing. The other staff is great as well. They treat their clients like family. My son is so excite every time he sees them.  I would definitely recommend these people for anyone with child development needs! They would be worth traveling for...
5 I love this office and my primary care physician, Dr. Lau. My mom, dad, brother, and I have been patients of Dr. Lau for at least 10 years. We all have nothing but great things to say about Dr. Lau and this practice. She is very thorough with her appointments and never makes you feel like she is in a rush. Her medical advice is always explained in a way that can be easily understood by her patients. I love the fact that I can email Dr. Lau with a medical question or concern and hear back from her within a day or two. She is an outstanding doctor who truly cares about the well being of her patients!
1 I called looking for Physical therapy specifically for balance related to inner ear damage. I wanted to know if they had anyone that specialized in it, experience they've had treating inner ear damage, etc. I called and spoke to a lady and got Luke warm responses and was told all of the therapist treated balance issues. To me, she was less than enthusiastic and not very informative. Although I'm sure she is a very nice lady, she said nothing that would convince me that this was the place to treat my problem.
1 I was given this Drs. name by a family friend who says she loves Dr. Tan. Well, I have called this office 5 times and left 4 voicemails with NO calls back ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! As someone who has worked in medical all my life, I think this is one of the most unprofessional things an office can do, sad to say, the Dr. probably does not even know this is happening! So, I'm not rating the Dr. on this review, I'm rating the SERVICE by whoever I leave those messages for asking every time if they would please call me so I can schedule an appt! I have issues that I need a new dr. for and I really do not want to drive out to Scottsdale any longer. I hope this office reads this post as I will continue to write negative reviews for them until this issue is fixed!
2 Before my upcoming wedding I had been eating right, exercising 5 times a week, but I was looking for something to possibly give me that additional bit of tone and firming that would make me feel extra pretty on my wedding day.  I decided to give WBWH Studio a try. I signed up for 4 sessions. I know the goal is to try and go as often as possible to see optimal results, but after the first session I just wasn't that impressed.  First time- I didn't layer thick enough and I had some hot spots. My lady didn't check on me until the last 15 minutes of my session and I rang the buzzer twice.  Second time- I was put in a room with another customer which was really awkward for the both of us. Lying in a bed sweating for an hour with a complete stranger next to me was not relaxing. Less hot spots because I had thicker layers.  Third time- I double layered but still had hot spots. Check out my pictures with how red my skin was after the sessions. I didn't like how towards the end of the session I was asked to book my next appointment. Kind of disrupted my "me time". Fourth time- I canceled my appointment and won't be back.  The wellness wraps claim to possibly burn up to 1400 calories, burn fat, detoxify, and reduce stress.  After the first session I realized that I am not their ideal candidate. I am very thin and have low body fat and very little problem areas. The 3 ladies that helped me during my sessions had trouble wrapping the wraps tight enough around my body so that the wraps made contact with me.  The studio was clean and I say give wraps a try if you think it may help you in your beauty journey. I have already recommended this studio to gal pal who was looking for extra help firming up.
1 Well this is the equivalent of punishment! This medical office is the reason I stay away from doctors. I was asked to come in 15-30 minutes before my appointment only to sit around waiting for the Dr. for nearly an hour. From what I can see the entire practice is disorganized and lacking in customer service.
5 Dr. Ryan is the best and really helped our newborn baby girl, Maylee! She was having issues down her neck and spine and after only 3 months and 8 or 9 visits she looked 10 times better and her scans showed a huge improvement from when she was born. Highly recommend this practice!
1 I have been going here for about two years now. My wait times are usually long. The waiting room is usually empty when I arrive, so I can never understand why it always takes 10 - 15 minutes to see me, then another 10 - 15 minutes for the doctor to arrive.    There are plenty of thing that still irk me about this place besides waiting: They take a lunch from noon until 1:30 pm, so if you have a lunch break and need to talk to someone, tough luck. Why do they need an hour and a half for everyone to take a lunch? Also, getting test results used to come through email or they would call me. Now I have to call them, then call back several times to see if I need to see the Dr again because I'm still sick. Then they tell me he might be sending me a referral in the mail but they don't know yet... SO I wait for the mail to arrive for a week and nothing.  Do I call back? Has Dr Tran decided whether I should get a referral yet?   It's so strange.   I am buying myself a car today just so I can go to see a doctor I don't have to walk to. This place is far too disorganized.
5 My boyfriend had gone to see Angelo for guided pemf after breaking the fifth metatarsal bone in his hand. He had approximately 30% Mobility with his pinky finger and after three visits he has now improved to 90% Mobility and almost no pain. This had a much better result than any Physical Therapy he had done previously. We both highly recommend Angelo and his staff.
5 So far I've met with Vanessa (owner) and Erin.  Both have given me great direction.  Erin takes the time to make sure that positionally I'm doing the exercise correctly to get the full effect.
2 This physio isn't great...i can see why the guy could have been frustrated.  They book people back to back and some at the same time of your appoints...so instead of giving you your full time..they put you on some machine and go see someone else instead of be with you for the 30 minutes or 1 hour.  of course they still charge you the full price and think this is good service.  The receptionist is barely there...it goes to voicemail.  The times of the clinic are also not accessible...and not sure when there is a medical director there.  Who knows what they charge your insurance company for your treatment plan as they don't show you the receipts or are transparent.  They beds aren't really cleaned off after each session or the pillows etc...it's pretty much a money making venture over actual care.  There were a few physios who I think cared about your health but they have left as far as i know. and yes, sometimes you get people who don't seem to know much. and they also get upset when you are late but then make you wait when you get there or put you on some machine to see other clients.  Not sure where the ACTIVE therapy is happening as that is supposed to make treatment better first for most cases...hand manipulation, etc.
5 I love how doc is so thorough with his new patients. He devises a plan for you from the get go so there aren't any surprises along the way. Pleasant experience each time!
5 I wanted to take some time to write a review for Chris, I've had several massages from him and he's great at what he does. Professionalism is number one for me and you get that from him but also his down to earth relaxing manner. I sent a lot of my own clients to Chris as well and they always come back and tell me that they loved him and that he really helped them feel better. He's great, take my advice and try him. Also when your a first time client , when you get an hour massage you get an extra 1/2 hour for free :)
1 This place should be shut down.  My mother went in two weeks ago and her apt was at 3:30 they FORGOT about her in the room for two hours then started shutting of the lights of the practice. They literally forgot about a patient!  Shame on you Dr. Cunningham.  They pack people in wall to wall.  My mother doesn't have transportation she gets there and spends hours at a time.  She is finally done with this place thank god!  The receptionist refused to fax a referal that the wound care special needs, my mother is very close to losing her leg!  She went there two weeks ago they didn't even give her a referral or antibiotice and her leg is bad!  Because they forgot about her in the room they had her come back a whole week later for another visit and referal.  The wound is infected they gave her a shot of a broad spectrum antibiotic that only last three days she had to wait four more days with no antibiotics in her system for her visit.  She had an E.R visit at banner prior to this and they were concerned that this could even kill her if not addressed.  They don't care about people, they should be shut down.  I plan on making a you tube video as well as interviewing people out side the office and will post it with their signed consent on line.  The front office lady with a strong Hispanic accent hung up on me four times trying to get the referal.  She refused to give us her name and kept hanging up on us.  That happen today July 30th 2015 at 4pm.  Come on are you that lazy it takes only 30 seconds to send a fax!  Stay far far away.  Shame on dr. Cunningham for not taking charge of his staff and schedule why be a doctor if you don't care about people!  People are wall to wall in their and their need are not being met!  Poor service.   No preventative care. Update: The referal we finally got was for a nurse to dress her wound.  Really she needs a SURGEON and reconsteuction of a tenden!  This place is a real joke.
1 This place is terrible there is always a long wait even if there is no one in the lobby and pretty much every single time I have came they just tell me to take over the counter medicine don't waste your time and money go to your family doctor or if it's an emergency just go to the hospital
5 Wonderful . from front desk to adjustments to physical therapy. I recommend them. They accept blue cross blue shield, with my co pay. Open 5 days a week.
5 My stay at Sante of Mesa,  was as good as it gets for a lengthy stay at a facility. The care was wonderful, the entire staff was knowledgeable, considerate and professional. The facility was immaculate,  the food was better then many restaurants. If need be then I would definitely suggest Sante of Mesa.
5 I've been going to Dr. S. for about 4 months now and l wish I had started chiropractic care much earlier in life.  I am in my mid 40's now and had been suffering from all kinds of aches and pains which I use to think were a part of just growing old.  I decided to see a chiropractor through the advise of a colleague. It's been one of the best decisions of my life. I like that the initial consultation was not rushed and very thorough.  I was surprised that I didn't get any work done that first day, but rather it was used to come up with a comprehensive plan for recovery.  I had been through 2 major car accidents in my life, plus numerous other injuries along the way, so I had been suffering from neck, shoulder, back pain for the later part of my life.  Before seeing Dr. S., I had this funny "lump in my throat" feeling from accidentally swallowing a fish bone months before.  I did not discuss this during the initial health screen with Dr. S. because I frankly didn't think it was something he could fix.  Months before, I had gone to see a Otolaryngologist who diagnosed it as possibly due to acid reflux.  The Specialist put a scope down there but could not find anything. After the Specialists' treatment the sensation did not go away. I decided to live with it as it was more of an annoyance than anything.   Well immediately after my first adjustment, that feeling in my throat just disappeared.  I had been suffering from it for almost a year and when I woke that morning with the feeling gone, I was skeptical at first. It wasn't until about a month later that I decided to tell Dr. S. my relief.  I now believe that my nerves in my neck had something to do with it and the adjustment somehow relieved that fake sensation of something being there.  Also my neck, shoulder, and back pain are also about 95% gone now.  I feel good.  I highly recommend that if you are suffering from pain and discomfort in your back or other parts of your body, let Dr. S. see what he can do for you!  I was once a skeptic but no longer any more!
5 I found Function Pilates through Groupon last year and I am so glad I did!  Every instructor I've had has been wonderful and I love the personal attention you get in the small group setting.  Every class is different with plenty of variety to keep you motivated.  If you enjoy pilates, I would highly recommend Function Pilates.
5 Right when I walked in they treated me like family. Rafael is very knowledgable and easy going. He's made playing sports much easier with the exercises, stretches and tips he provides along with the treatment session.
5 I've been in pain for years and years...pain all over my body.. Especially on my lower back. I'd cried at night because It's painful and I felt it more during winter time. I've had sleepless nights. I'd wake up in pain to the point that I couldn't move and I couldn't  get up or walk, it's excruciating. I've seen doctors and chiropractors but they just prescribed me ibuprofen and like what my husband  said.. I popped pills like its skittles... But the pain didn't  go away.. it was temporary and my body just can't take it anymore.   I was treated a few times by Rowena and recently it was with Rosemarie. I was complaining about my hips, groin, and lower back. I found out that my hips were not aligned and so Rosemarie begun the healing process and she even taught me how to treat myself by stretching, using the ball and other tools. Right at that moment my hips were fixed and aligned again! I woke up the next day with no pain until now. It's amazing that I can move my body freely, walk, bend and work with no pain and I also sleep like a baby!   I am thankful for Rowena and Rosemarie for treating me. They both are very helpful and professional about their work. They do a great job and they are passionate about healing. They have so much care and love for their patient so they go above and beyond with the service they give. MFR is the way to go! Best Therapist in Vegas!
5 I actually won a years worth of free massages at this location in a PCH raffle.  I would not have chosen this location as it isn't that close to my house, however I'm not going to pass up a free massage. Turns out I'm happy to make the drive as the staff is supper friendly and I always get an excellent massage.  It really is rare now days to consistently get good service and since I get just that at this Elements I thought it important to write the review.  Also, how great are they to make a donation like this to help out PCH?!  Really Great. I started out going to Laura, who was excellent however she left, but recommended I start seeing Emily, which is what I did. Emily would always checkin with me to see what hurts, what I might need work on.  She is an excellent therapist.  Had nothing but a great experience at this location.  Its worth the drive, as the staff and Emily were wonderful.
2 After our last visit we have some issues with this facility.  Dr. Bertoli is very nice and most staff are nice.  The waits are long.  They don't do anything on time.  Also the most concerning thing is that Dr. Bertoli prescribed a certain medication for my wife on 4-2-15 and advised it would need prior approval from the insurance company.  Turns out no approval needed. Well, here it is April 30th and we find that Caremore didn't even fax the paperwork until April 27th, after we called back to find out what is going on.  Their follow up staff are evidently incompetent.
2 The doctor is nice, but for a doctor's office "Nice" doesn't quite cut it.   The pros:  1. Dr. Gunn seems very personable and attentive. According to his bio online, he got his medical degree in Mexico, so he is probably able to communicate in both English and Spanish.  2. Also, while their staff seems to be hard to reach, it appears that they are not exactly *that* busy. I may have had to call a few times, but I was able to make appointments really soon after I finally reached them.They had a lot of choices for appointments. I think this is good-- especially for semi-emergencies.  The cons: 1. The office manager. Dear goodness, where do I begin?   I had a question about the bill and the staff was unable to answer my questions. They told me I should call the manager, which was a very difficult process. I felt like they wanted me to just give up. I called three times over a couple weeks and couldn't reach them. Eventually, I left a message for her on her machine AND asked someone in the office for her to get  back to me. She did that afternoon.  Within a few minutes of discussing the bill, it was clear to me that she had lost her temper. She brought up that the bill might be sent to collections if I didn't resolve it -- although the late date for paying had to do with the fact that she couldn't be reached. She also stated that she was "baffled" by me not understanding the appointment costs like "most people." Even over the phone it was obvious that she was raising her voice, using condescending language (she found me "baffling" more than once) and using an angrier and angrier tone as we talked.  Even if it the patient is wrong (as I may or may not have been), I don't think a person in the health field should lose their cool -- ever. For me, they represent the business almost as much as the doctor.  They ended up wiping out part of the disputed charge, which I think was fair compromise. Still, it felt like a nasty boxing match in order to do so. Most offices try to work with you, but *this* felt very adversarial.   2. The staff and the location.  The staff seems pretty bored and unfriendly. Besides, I get the feeling that there is only so much they can do -- it seems to me like all major decisions go through the manager.   The location doesn't inspire confidence either-- nestled into the corner of a strip mall-looking area. But, on the bright side you can walk on over to a Burger King in the same lot if you're famished after an exam.  TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read):  In my experience:  Dr Gunn is nice. Hard to reach them, but a lot of options for appointments. Get ready to rumble when it comes to billing disagreements.
1 Ok, here it goes. Had referral from a friend he went there for physical therapy. I requested a referral from my primary care physician for my diagnosed shoulder surgery. The Core called me to set the appointment. I arrived at the appointment 20 mins early. Went through the the preliminary check in, got the pager and waited to be called back for the copayment. Well an hour goes by and the receptionist asks who I was waiting for. I told her and she replied that I was a no show. Well a few calls later and I was back at the desk to pay. A few minutes later I was on the way for x-Rays even though I had the MRI disk and report with me. Ok, no problem I am at least  moving through the system. Next stop the waiting room again there for about 5 mins and I was taken to an exam room. I answered a few questions, normal stuff, and a few mins later the doctor came in. He had me go through some movements with my arms and turned to me and said yes you need surgery. Then he told me that he was not the doctor I need to see. I was a little confused since the core called me to set up the appointment but ok let's get to the right doctor. We set the appointment and I was on my way it after 5:00 p.m. so the front desk was closed. I called The Core the next day and asked if they could apply my $60.00 co pay to my next appointment since they had scheduled me with the wrong doctor and $60.00 is $60.00. They said no because the doctor performed an "exam". I explained the whole thing to them again received no apology just no. So if you don't mind the double billing scam very poor customer service and NO accountability this is the place for you.
5 Another great location from Neck and Back.  I am a computer IT and always have back problems, after a few adjustments they always have me up and going.  Thanks !
5 Since my knee surgery earlier this year, I couldn't even bend my knee 90 degrees. But after working with Savannah and staff, I'm able to do my activities with less pain than before my surgery.   Savannah was my primary physical therapist, and she was always professional, encouraging and positive. I always felt confident in the help she gave me, as she was very attentive to my circumstances to make sure my exercises didn't cause me additional pain. She made sure I was working hard, too! The whole team at Chandler Physical Therapy is so friendly and helpful. They sincerely care about your success, both in physical therapy and in general. Their office is a great atmosphere to be in.
5 I was recently taken to emergency by ambulance after being hit by a truck and trailer on my bike. From the nurse who gave me codeine to the plastic surgeon to the x-ray technician, I was well taken care of. A month of surgery, healing and follow-ups has resulted in being almost back to normal, which I owe to the hard work of the St. Michael's team.
5 Top notch facility!!!  They focus on overall health via physical therapy and training rather than just treating the current issue until it fells better.
5 Yvette is the best massage therapist. I continue to go there even after moving out of the area, and even when another rmt was across the street from my home.
5 I absolutely love both Dr. George and Dr. Parker. Both are extremely knowledgeable. They listen you and your concerns and are very thorough. They make sure that before you leave their office that they have answered every question you may have. They are both wonderful with our infant daughter, as well.  I am so happy to find doctors that I actually trust in Las Vegas. Highly recommended!
5 Dr. D and his staff are true professionals. I never thought I would come to a chiropractor.   After falling off the top of a six foot ladder, I was in so much pain. I would have done anything to be able to move without pain in my neck and shoulder.   After taking xrays of my neck, Dr D found that I had one disc completely turned and some other issues with the curvature of my neck.   The movement in my neck has improved so much. I owe that all to twice weekly adjustments with Platinum Medical Group.   I highly recommend this business.   They also offer IV drips, weight management, facials and more on site.   Visit with confidence and tell Dr D you saw him on Yelp. :)
5 I cannot say enough positive things about Arcadia Health and Wellness - I would highly, highly recommend going here to see Dr. Dom and Dr. Matt if you've ever had any sort of body soreness.  Background: I lift and do CrossFit.  I have a desk job that requires me to sit at a computer for most of the day and I carry a lot of stress in my traps, neck and upper back.  Dr. Dom and Dr. Matt gave me stretches to do at home, taught me the role pressure points play in relieving your stress, and did it with a smile on their faces.  If you're worried about cost, they honestly just want to make sure you feel better and will work out something with you that will fit what you can pay.  This is what I wish all modern medicine could be - great customer care, improving health.  Candice at the front is amazing as well!  Making appointments and checking in is always a joy! :)
4 After a very bad car accident, my son was here for one month. The doctors, nurses and physical therapy staff were wonderful. What the PT staff taught him made a world of difference. He was able to continue the therapy on his own and according to his orthopedic surgeon, didn't need to have additional therapy after his discharge because they worked so well with him. The nurses were so kind and caring not just for my son but also for me. I do recommend this facility. No one wants to come to a rehab facility, but if for some reason you need to, you will find a caring and trained staff.
2 Just had my first appt with Dr. Wedlow. She was very unpersonable. Didn't smile once and was on her computer the whole time. I didn't feel comfortable. For a primary care doctor you want to feel like your doctor listened not like you're just another patient. The front desk staff were pretty nice but that's about it.
1 Amazing Doctors, and Physicians but the wait time to get seen even with an appointment is 2hrs+! That to me is a little absurd! The lobby is run down. I've been coming here for years. Just isn't the same but I keep coming for the doctors that I trust with my health! I might have to give up soon
5 Neuromuscular massage is a modality that I had never even heard of, before visiting NCSAB. I wanted to treat chronic pain, without having to go through surgery or use any narcotics. This school teaches it's students to target deeply into a muscle, in order to let the body respond naturally, and the results are amazing. If you want to learn about how to treat chronic pain, this is the school for you. If you are looking to see the results for yourself, book an appointment. The students here are given an education that cannot be compared to any other massage school. Do yourself a favor and check them out!
5 After 3 surgeries on different parts of my body, all handled here, I would definetly say this is the place to go.  The Dr's here are all awesome!!!  Dr. Yee is by far the coolest, most professional Dr around.  He will give you an honest opinion and doesn't take any shortcuts to make sure you get back to full health.  The rest of the staff are always a pleasure to be around, especially Meg C (I love you).  If you have a knee, shoulder, hip, foot, whatever kind of injury, don't even consider anyplace else, these guys are awesome.
4 I've been bringing my family here since I first moved  to Vegas in December  2013. I give them a 4 out of 5 because in the beginning (2013)it was great but then sometime around 2015/2016 it seemed to be losing its spark. There was one older Dr. in particular that I thought was a little rude(I hope he was just having an off day). There was constantly new faces. Now I am glad to have gone recently a few days ago! I met the new Dr. Green. She was wonderful with my children. She talked to them and explained everything to me so well. I really loved that she didn't rush out so quickly like  other doctor's do. I hate going to doctor offices waiting forever and then the doctor is with you for about 1 minute and poof gone. She definitely made us feel important and cared about. Dr. Alan  is a great doctor too, he does rush out quickly but he's a wonderful doctor, never had any complaints about him or Dr. Dayco. The staff is great! They are all super nice. I especially like Ana (I think that is her name.) I'm always asking questions about referrals or when I make appointments and I am being picky with time or dates she always makes me feel comfortable and never makes me feel like I'm an annoying mom. Haha! I know of other places that don't like to work with their times. They schedule appointments very soon too which is always helpful with sick kids. Overall it's a great place for you and your family. I plan on coming more often now that it's spark is back I won't be hesitant to make appointments!
1 front office seems to do almost anythn to keep u from seeing the dr. They will have a copy of yer insurance card, yer ID, yer referral n anythn else under the sun they might need,  yet they still want u to carry all things w u at all times.  so many times I've been rushing out the door or in so much pain I can't think straight n am told,  "Sorry, I need to see yer ID n insurance card". other times I am either waitn for over an hour n a half, or I'm refused to be seen because I'm a minutes past the 15 minutes mark... Drs are scared to prescribe enough medicine to allow u to function,  so either way, someway, somehow, I end up screwed. I'm havn a hard time findn somethn else, but trust me, I will. especially since they have twice said they will no longer be takn my insurance, n the recanted, causing me to make insurance arrangements, only to cancel two times. horribly disorganized place, don't even bother!
5 Truly enjoyed my service, I needed to have the services of Infrared Body Wraps to assist in the reduction of subcutaneous water.  The owner was very knowledgeable of performing the services and did so in a professional manner. Wherever I return to Las Vegas, I will certainly be paying this place a visit.
5 Dr. Radoff and his staff are great. Honesty is what I want and honesty is what i get overtime. This is my second review for him somehow the other one was lost. If Found its as honest as it gets. He's a excellent Dr. and no one could tell me to go to anyone else. I found a Doctor that is straight to the point and doesn't beat around the bush. He isn't rude and the staff is just as great.
3 Well let's start with an appointment set months in advance for skin screen. Went to the initial appointment and doctor advised to have some moles removed, make another appointment. Fast forward to yesterday, took time off work went in only to have another skin screen and to advise what the original Doctor stated as far as removal of any moles isn't needed!  Mind you I had to pay $100 co pay and top that off with time off from work.  Tried to work with the billing dept to have them do the right thing and they informed me that the initial Doctor I met with wasn't a specialist for skin screen. So DO Not go here, it's very apparent they have no respect for families or individuals as it pertains to billing. Heck I could keep going here but I might get the office front desk person filling in as a specialist for skin screening.  Update to my posting: Crystal reached out to me and with an understanding of the issue she worked with me and made reflective changes to the way things are processed and ensured that she and her staff can work harder and winning and retaining clientele. To that I say "Thank you Crystal"!!
5 Can't say enough good about XCEL and Dr. Johnson.  In 3 sessions together we've made major progress on a couple of pains that have been nagging me for years.   In addition to the adjustments, etc. that Dr. J does in-person during our appointments together, he is great about also giving information and exercises that I can do on my own at home. This self-empowerment is key for long-term health and wellness.  Along with knowledge and technical mastery of his craft, Dr. Johnson possess a calm, friendly and down-to-earth personality that puts me at ease during our sessions together.  I highly recommend XCEL Sports Clinic for anyone living/traveling in the Scottsdale area who needs chiropractic, active release therapy or other similar treatments.
4 The front office is horrible, and the nurses leave often (Thank heavens) but Dr. Germaine is my to go guy! I tried a few of the PA's they were awful. I see only Dr. Allen Germaine, I trust him, and most days he will lent an ear, and listen when I speak.    so the 5 stars for the Doc fell off a little due to awful rude incompedent staff, but that happens with most good doc's these days. not sure why?  and if I get a good staff the Doc is a Quack like D.O. I can't even remember his name,he literally tried to kill me, no wonder I can't remember him! Dr. Germaine and I have built a good repoir and he is close by, Thank heavens.
5 I wanted to express my gratitude to my PA Nicole. She is so friendly and kind hearted. She makes you feel welcomed from the first time you meet her. She's cares about your feelings and always willing to help you.
5 Went there for check up cause I was having health issue and didn't have a family doctor. All the staff were super nice and welcoming. I went on a Monday morning 5min before they open~and there were 10 people in line already in front of me. I thought I was going to wait for like half an hour before I get to see an doctor. But they were really fast and the doctors answered my question patiently. My advice is not go on a Monday morning but do go before they open. My next visit was on Tuesday to get my lab result. And I went at the same time there was no one in line.
2 I have been coming to WFP since 2003 and this was when they were located at their old office. Down the road. Over the years I have seen so many changes. Some  good but lately I have been disappointed.   When the new office opened I was so excited to see a bigger office with more doctors and PA's. I was also able to make same day appointments incase of an emergency like strep or a bad cough.   A few years ago things started to go down hill. I never saw the same people at the front desk. The front desk staff is so rude and won't even smile at you. The wait time is over 35 minutes just in the waiting room then another 15 minutes once you are in a room. The doctor sees you for 10 minutes then Moves on. I really feel like they see me as a number and they just want my money. The compassion has left the building. WFP is not the same like it was many years ago. Nobody communicates with each other so I am always told different things when I call the office or when I talk to someone in person.   I hope Dr. Turner reads these reviews and then figures out why his practice is receiving negative reviews about the same issues I have discussed. Something needs to be fixed and they need to stop kicking people out of their practice via mail instead of a personal phone call. That is horrible customer service. But when they want your money they won't stop calling you. Hmmmm....
1 I would not let my worst enemy go to this shady place of business.  They first told my daughter she had thyroid cancer, then it wasn't thyroid cancer it was lymphoma.  Gave her a name to a surgeon told her to have her thyroid removed and sent her on her way.  We didn't take their advice we went to Cancer Treatment Centers of America.  Turns out my daughter doesn't have either type of cancer.  If you could sue for false diagnosis, unneeded stress and mental anguish this HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE institution has inflicted on our family I would in a minute!!!!!
1 Should change their name to INCOMPLETE CARE MEDICINE! Was not satisfied by any of the service I received at my appt (it was my 2nd time going there). The first visit was fine, but the 2nd one I had nothing but problems from the minute I walked in their door. I was 10 mins early to my appt, but the front desk waited till they checked me in to verify my insurance instead of having it done ahead of time. By the way I too work for a dr and know the importance of insurance verification and patient quality!! The front desk kept saying I have a deductible plan and the base price for the days visit would be at least $80.  WHAT!?! I offered them my ins card twice so they could see it says $25 copay but they refused to look at it. It took them 25 minutes of screwing around to finally say your charge will be $20 today (so now I will be getting a bill for the remaining $5 of my copay). My appt was 15 mins into by the time the front desk checked me in and I was called back.  I saw a PA (Brittany) who seemed more concerned about ordering labs and doing an ear wash instead of the real reason I was there. The medical assistant who did the lavage was terrible. I had water running all over me--the top half of one of my pant legs was completely soaked and I had a huge wet spot right on the front of my shirt. I guess it was 2 for 1, an ear wash and a shower. Not only that I informed both the m.a. and the PA that I couldn't hear anything out of my right ear after getting it washed out. There response was simply "it'll pop" (took 16 hrs for it to finally pop). They didn't even look in my ear more than 2 seconds to see if I had water and where. An m.a. I work with did a much more thorough job of looking in my ear and being able to tell me you have water behind your ear, so you might get an infection. An m.a. can tell me this, but your PA can't? Sorry, but I'll be looking for a new dr. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS PLACE!
1 They are absolutely TERRIBLE. Worst customer service I've ever experienced. I've never in all my life had to call repeatedly just to not get hung up on for calls, wait on hold extensively and was just told - even though I just had a full physical last month that I will be requiring another visit JUST to get an RX to approve me to use my FSA for Allegra D 24 hour (which doesn't even require an RX). Absolutely the worst office administration and most unhelpful and downright rude staff. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time. Even my fave Doc of 9 years left along with the best Nurse Practitioner.
5 I went to this class on a monday night, never having done pilates before.  It is a small class of 5 people.  The instructor was great in helping me out without making me feel like a complete looser.  The girls in there taking the class with me had been doing it for a while and looked spectacular, the truth.  The studio is small but very nice and clean, I actually saw the instructor clean the mats before and after we were done.  They have refreshments,  snacks and everything you need.  All you have to do is show up.  The price of the class is 25 dollars per.  You have to schedule one week in advance but I think it is totally worth the price and commitment!  I couldn't walk the next day so I know it is doing it's job!  If you like pilates I would totally recommend it, for new bee's it's a little difficult and yes it hurts. The good pain.
5 I give 5 stars even though we had to wait for over an hour past our appointment time.    Dr. Sharma was compassionate, sympathetic, thoughtful and very helpful.  He is the type of physician we have hoped to find for many years.  The office is spartan, but clean, nothing fancy here, and he has special prices for those who are without health insurance. I believe this is at the heart of his philosophy, and that he believes in the hippocratic oath.  I can only echo the other 5 star reviews in our luck in finding this man.    Such a difference from all the other doctors we have been to in the past.  He takes the time necessary to actually listen to his patients unlike the majority of doctors these days who have 8 minute max time limits for each patients, just to make their daily minimums.  You might have to wait but I think you will be happy you did.
1 I waited to see the doctor for over 2 hours today for an issue with my foot. When I finally saw the 'doctor', he didn't  even look at my foot and said there was nothing he could do. Then I checked my paperwork when I got home and it listed my pulse, respiration and other stats that were never taken. The whole experience was the worst I ever had with any medical provider my entire life! Definitely reporting this to my insurance provider and my referring doctor. Stay away from this shoddy operation!
5 I rarely go to urgent or emergency care as I prefer natural healthcare and for the most part, did not have positive results with most medical doctors in the past.  Well this was quite a change of experience.  I had a cold that got worse.  I went in for some antibiotics to deal with the problem.  After chest X-ray and an examination, was told that I had pneumonia.  They prescribed some wonderful things that helped me feel better the next day.  The doctor and staff here probably saved my life.  I am rarely impressed with medical doctors but the staff here is awesome.  Very caring, nice, and helpful people.  If other doctors were compassionate and helpful as here, medical doctors would have a good rep.  This is definitely on my A-List of places to go.
1 I went to see dr Kim about a concern I had regarding an irregular lump I had. With an extensive family history with cancer, tumors and cysts, of course I was highly concerned about it and the issues arising around the bump as well. When I saw the dr, as a new patient he never introduced himself. He thought my name was misspelled (it's unusual I understand) but instead of talking to me and asking if that was right and making conversation he just started researching my ID and information for the first few minutes of my appointment. He then went to tell me my family history has nothing to do with a bump on the outside except the cysts and told me it was so little and insignificant there was nothing he could do. Recommended a general surgeon, but said there was nothing else he could do and never even gave me a sort of indication as what he might think it is, where my issues were coming from if not from the lump, and actually told me there was no reason to come in. Even if that's true, any dr could've been more considerate and appealing to the patient at hand. The office staff was VERY nice and the person taking my weight and height was great, but the dr was rude, disrespectful, and not what you want with cancer on the brain. My in laws have been with him for years and will no longer be using them.
5 I've been dealing with neck issues for awhile and my doctor recommended massage therapy. I tried LifeHealthMassage based on Yelp's reviews and booked an appointment with Debbie: she is a great massage therapist! She took the time to explain to me what the problem was, how to address it and what to do to help at home. She also offered suggestions on alternative therapy to maximize relief! Very happy!
5 This place is the best kept secret in the Northern GTA - very quick in terms of waiting time, professional doctors, friendly staff - definitely a winning combination.   Been there twice with my kids, over the last 8 months - both times everything went very quickly (on the first visit we were admitted immediately).  Will repeat, if the need arises.
2 Dr. B is an angel. She is the best Chiropractor I have ever met.  Unfortunately she is only there one day a week now and the current staff just doesn't give the same time and attention that Dr. B did.
4 I decided initially on Fiesta due to their location and ability to schedule appoint with a working mom. My LO had torticollis and needed some help. Our peditrician had referred him to a different office that blantely said they couldn't help me with my schedule. Once decided it still took them a while to schedule an appointment, because all of a sudden there were no openings. Then there was a maybe and so with the scheduler " Al' on the phone I took the day off, while at work. He would call me back. Nothing happened for 10 days, so I call them and yes there was one opening. Initially I need PT and OT.   We went in for OT and actually met the owner Beth, she was very nice and when I explained it took me  2 months to schedule, she apologized and was very firm about me being able to schedule. I wasn't the only working mom right. She even asked me who in scheduling took that time to not get me in sooner. She went to the front desk and came back with an appoinment on the day that worked best for me. She was so friendly with my LO when she did her observation.  At the next appointment we met Shelly who was going to do the PT with my LO. She again was very nice to work with and still is. Now we were relying on getting the weekly appointment scheduled on my day off. They are a very busy office. All of a sudden the whole somewhat negative experience with Al changed. Joanne called me 3 times to let me know she was working her hardest to move other families around so I could get a weekly spot on my day off and yay she managed and so kudos to Joanne.  The office is very nice and clean. Now I am really happy to go there
4 I was having trouble getting my son into the Clark County School District speech therapy program when we first moved, and a friend of mine recommended My Left Foot. She said that Sharon, one of the speech and language pathologists there, did a wonderful job with her daughter.  We only went once because then the school system called, but I was really impressed by the programs they had -- not just speech but physical therapy, yoga, aquatic classes and more. They work with a wide variety of developmental issues to help those kids get on a more even playing field with their peers, just when they need it most.
5 Very recently I had written a negative review about the Aliante location personal training. The GM Quinn there is awesome & the front desk staff were super nice. They were not an issue at all at Aliante location.   The personal training management responded immediately. I went into the centennial location tonight and I feel better. They are definitely doing their best to make things right. I will update in a month or so, being that this was day one of a way more positive experience, just from the moment I walked in. Everyone was pleasant and smiling. I'm hoping it continues!
5 I've been to many physical therapy offices and none have been worth returning to--until I found Foothills Sports Medicine on Alma School in Chandler! Lauren and the team are caring, professional people who really care about their patients. Hard to find people like them. I would definitely go back there and definitely recommend anyone to go to Foothills for physical therapy!
5 Dr. Jordan and her staff, Marcie, Crystal, and the new girl I cannot remember her name are the best office in the valley!  Dr. Jordan is the most direct Dr. I have ever encountered.  Even in my 21 years in the U.S. Marine Corps I never had a Dr. who just lays it on the line....some people might be offended by that, but my wife and I, both diabetics, really appreciate her direct approach to our health.  With that said she is also a very caring person and has always been there for us, even providing us a private number to get a hold of her.  The highest compliment a Marine can pay someone is telling them they would go to war with that person....well Dr. Jordan, I would go to war with you in a minute.....An appreciative retired Marine and his wife!
3 Not bad. Wait time is always long at these urgent care facilities, but the place was clean and the staff friendly.
3 Something of a local celebrity, Zorba Paster is a radio/health figure. That is, he can be awesome, but please, take it with a grain of salt. The medical field isn't infallible, and extremes/ultimatums that he presents are difficult to absorb as useful advice.
2 I miss GOLDS GYM. Disappointed that a few amenities were taken away. New staff isn't as friendly or knowledgeable as past employees. I totally understand that since there is New Ownership.. changes are sometimes made but I have no desire to keep my memberships. I enjoyed going to tan from time to time & now I have to pay an additional $10 if I wish to continue.. no thanks. Sauna is ALWAYS broken.
5 I love this place they are so friendly and they have everything you need and great deals for trainers I worked with Katie for a while she is so sweet
1 With first look, this place looked like a good place for my Mom as she needed 24/7 care, and looking around at nursery homes has been a crazy experience.  The first night my Mom was there, we got a call in the middle of the night telling us she broke her arm from getting out of bed.  I was furious.  I had told them from the beginning she was a fall risk, and they needed to add the bed posts to her bed.  Then we had to move her into a new room, three times, due to ants and other insects getting into her room.  And then one of her room mates was making so much noise, we had to move her again.  My Mom wouldn't eat any of their food, she hated it.  I went there to try the food myself, and gotta say, it was horrible!  So me and my sisters would bring her food every day to insure she was getting the proper nutrition.  Then my Mom went out of control yelling and not listening to the nurses as they were forcing her to take a bath.  I had to go in and bathe her myself.  After that, no one would bathe her or try to get her cleaned up; so I had to make sure it was done myself.  What the hell are we paying these people for if they are not taking care of my Mom?!  I also seen bruises on my Mom's arms, yet no one knows how they got there.  If you have a loved one that you care for deeply, do not bring her to this home; they will not take care of them.  Very sad.
1 My primary care physician was Dr. Chia-how Liu, whom we've referred several patients to over the last several years.  It was difficult making appointments with him because he is usually very busy and his office staff isn't the friendliest, but we really enjoyed his style and the care my husband and I have always received, until I was in an auto accident.  I was told by the emergency room that I was to make an appointment with my primary care doctor within the next week.  I called his office, explained that I was in an auto accident and they said Dr. Liu could not see me for another week.  After a subsequent call describing the urgency of being seen, they were able to schedule me the following morning.  I was in a great deal of pain and after getting into their office, a member of their staff went back to talk to Dr. Liu then came out and told us Dr. Liu does not see auto accident patients unless I wanted to pay cash.  I explained that my insurance information has not changed, which she said did not matter.  He would only accept cash.    I could have paid cash, but the fact that my doctor decided to see me as a dollar figure instead of a person and a patient first, ruined the entire experience.  I want a doctor who cares about their patients, not just about the dollar figure attached to us.    If he would have come out and talked to me in person, it would have been appreciated. To see that I was clearly in pain, needing assistance, to come in and then be told oops "someone" should have told you we don't see auto accident patients. He didn't even offer to help me find another doctor!  It was just a horrible experience.  I would NEVER want anyone else to make the same mistake of choosing him as their primary care physician when they were really in need of one.
5 Amazing! Friendly staff that truly care about the well being of their patients! I recommend this place to all my friends and family! Even my kids come to this place! Truly wonderful place!
5 I see the reviews but I differ and give them five stars . Nice people in front and assistant came out immediately to see laceration toe. My wife recd 5 stitches from the doctor and even gave me a water since hit outside . We will come bck again and I recommend this place .. I'm very picky too. It is now five days since the doctor took care of my wife. No pain and the toe is healing nicely.
5 I have been extremely satisfied with my care at Impact Physical Therapy. I had a set back after my knee replacement surgery in which I had a serious limp and loss of knee extension. I did not want to have knee revision surgery and Dr. Dave Balzer treated me with such patience and expertise that I felt confident I could avoid another surgery. He never made me feel defeated, even though the task at hand was a difficult one. I chose this clinic due to to their expertise in so many effective techniques.Due to Dr. Dave's treatment I have made significant progress and my surgeon agrees I do not need further surgery. My limp is gone; I walk comfortably and my knee extension is greatly improved. Everyone who works there takes an interest in each and every patient who walks through the door. Thank you Dr. Dave and the entire staff for helping me get through this difficult time.
5 I am fairly new to verve, but my family has been going here and we all love it. I was able to get in the same day today and was treated like an actual human being instead of just the next patient in line. Dr. Haynes is amazing and makes sure she helps you in every way possible. Very pleased with my visit
1 This place is a joke. The staff is extremely unprofessional, the PA at this location (Whitney) and at the Sun City West location (Michelle) have terrible bedside manner and probably need to go back to school (you only need a C average to graduate college).  I came in with a clear issue (herniated disc between L4 and L5). I had all the classic symptoms and not once did I ask for drugs because they don't help.  After plainly asking why they wouldn't help me they had terrible reasons. "You are too young", "I don't think the surgeon will know how to help you", "We can only give you more injections", and "The doctor says there is nothing wrong and he won't see you." Well I am now 10 weeks post-op from surgery with my second opinion and I have my life back; I competed in a triathlon 9 weeks post-op.  Do not go to Core, they are the worst practice I have ever dealt with.  UPDATE!!!!! What an even bigger joke.  So I spoke to the Patient Care Advocate and he basically just wanted to make sure that I knew he was going to talk to the staff about my experience, yeah right.  He did ask if he could do anything for me, I told him he could waive the $19 bill they were trying to charge me.  He told me to just pay it and that the billing department would start calling me until I paid it.  I didn't realize they would start calling right after we hung up and that they would call me almost every day since we talked. $19 people, not $50, not $500, but $19.  What a petty, unprofessional company.  If you want to be mistreated this is the place to go.  Also, I will not stop posting negative comments, like I was asked to by the company.
1 If you are trying to get a referral from this office it is nearly IMPOSSIBLE!!!  Laura in referrals, is the absolute most useless employee there and I am not even sure why or how she is still employed there.  I started going to this office since it was sooo close to my house but now I am literally willing to drive ANYWHERE in the Phoenix area to see an actual Doctor(this location does not have 1 single doctor working there) vs. going back to this clinic.  I can see why the ratings for this clinic are averaging only 1 to 3 stars.  Very sad, you would think that they would do something to change.
1 After two failed attempts to have them return my calls in order to get my blood results I stopped in one day to request a photo copy of my results. They asked if I had a few minutes and they could go over them with me in person and of course there would be no charge. So I said yes and then later I received a bill! I have been fighting with them for over three months and they refuse to reverse it. Now they are losing both myself and my husband as patients! I never requested to be seen by a doctor and I do not feel that I should owe this. If they had told me that having somebody give me the results verbally would result in an office visit I would have said no just give me the photocopy like I came in for. In addition their back office people never return your calls or respond to your messages.
5 Dr. Day really knows about back and neck care.  I came to him with pain in my neck, shoulder and lower back and he has been truly great.  Not only does he help fix the problems but he also explains the symptoms and ways to find relief.  I would recommend him to anyone who is having pain in the back or someone who just wants to stay on top of their health.
5 I was so pleasantly surprised when I called this place last minute to ask if there was anyway I could come in for a massage.  I was sooo lucky that there was a last minute cancellation!  Honestly the best massage I have had in a long time.  Had recently been to Massage Envy and this place puts them to shame.  No pressure to buy anything, the doctor did a walk through showing me and another client the place.  I will definitely be coming back here and will recommend to all my friends and neighbors!  Also, the prices are amazing!!
1 This place is a mess. No special feeling about the doctor, but the admins(receptionists) don't know how to do an appropriate job.  Yesterday two people who walked in after us got to see the doctor first! We asked, were told that because they made an appointment!!  Today we had to come in again because the fever didn't go away overnight. Lesson learned, we called first to make an appointment. When we arrived, the receptionist exactly who we talked on the phone told us because a lot of people walked in before we came, so the appointment doesn't count now, we had to wait!!!   Conclusion: 1. Appointment system random and inconsistent: you might have people cut in the line anytime. 2. No sense of importance and emergency: they don't care to call you about your X-ray result because it's Saturday even though the doctor suspects chance of pneumonia. 3. Slow: It took 10 mins for the doctor to get ready to see the next patient after the previous patient left. We waited there for an hour and it was like this the whole time.   We came here because it opened early. But we won't come back again in the future.
4 im new to vegas and really needed an ortho doc for a cast.  this is a beautiful facility, busy office with friendly staff, and i am well satisfied with the care given.  i was referred by urgent care and walked right in.
5 Historically, I have never had good results from physical therapy.  With a nearly complete tear of my rotator cuff coupled with a desire to avoid surgery, I had to opt for physical therapy.  My doctor referred me to Achieve Physical Therapy and I just completed my visits today.  My skepticism has disappeared.  I have regained mobility that I had lost and my sleep is no longer disturbed by pain.  I was working with Henry, Dillon and GJ; however, the entire staff is great!  My knees need physical therapy as well and I have already scheduled my appointments.  They start tomorrow.
1 Rude and SLOW as F@#$ employees! There are only two patients waiting and it's been well over an hour! And turn some Fvcking heat on! I'm pissing ice cubes in here!
5 Came here as a walk in for a nagging cough and on and off flu. Waited 15 minutes, place was clean, and I left with a prescription in hand. Easy!
1 This is the worst gym i have ever dealt with. First, David Jackson who's a physical trainer there is more of a scam artists and a joke. My first day with him he spent most of the time not helping me and flirting to these two women who were working out. That should of warn me not to continue businesses with their physical trainers. Then when i came back for my next appointment they put me with some kid who had no idea wat he was doing and instead of the hour long appointment i was  told my $128 went to, is now thirty mins. When i tried to cancel David would not respond to any of my calls or texts. So I canceled my card and got a new one. Couldn't get anyone there to help me at all, I'd call and every time the person who i should talk to is "out for lunch". Guess what when they realized they aren't getting their money the gym now calls me every day trying to get it. So i called customer service phone number to pay for my membership with the gym (new card, membership stopped being paid for as well) i talked to a lady who took my info and said it was paid for. Next day i find out the lady who took my info did it wrong and it was never paid for at all. This gym is the worst possible gym you could use, I say go to planet fitness before you come here. I miss the old Golds Gym.
5 I had a fantastic personal experience with the team at Arizona Sports Physical Therapy.  I have had to see them twice (at the North Phoenix location - haven't been to the Central Phoenix location).  Once for a jacked up rotator cuff and the second time was for bursitis that I developed in BOTH hips.    The first time I went in I was assessed and then given a range of exercises that I could do on my own.  I followed the plan as given and was able to rehab my shoulder without multiple visits.  Of course, if I couldn't have done it on my own I would have gone back but I was diligent in my own treatment.  I went from not being able to lift my arm wash my hair or take off my bra without odd contortions (yeah, picture that for a minute) to good as new within about two months of diligent work.  Had I not gone it when I did, I very well could have done more damage and may have had to have surgery.  The second time, with the bursitis, took more work and multiple sessions for treatment and exercises.  When I went in I could barely walk and ANY impact (such as getting out of a truck) would about put me on the ground.  As an avid fitness instructor and runner, this obviously wasn't good.  I felt as if both hips had been struck with a hammer!  No joke...the bones themselves felt bruised.  I didn't want to make a separate appointment for a regular physical who was likely only going to prescribe me PT, so I made an appointment.  I went in for an assessment, where it was determined that I likely had bursitis, and was started on a range of treatments.  I'm not going to say that the manipulation was comfortable.  It wasn't...and some days I wanted to come off the bench BUT it was needed and I firmly believed that it contributed to my healing and rehabilitation process.  I had multiple sessions and I was taught exercises and stretches that I could incorporate into my workouts and do at home to help my rehabilitation process.  And, it worked!  I didn't have to go in for injections or surgery.  I firmly believe that had I not got in, I would have ended up a lot worse and would have had to endure far more painful experiences than a little manipulation to stretch the muscles.  Long story short:  I found the team at ASPT very knowledge and helpful to me not once, but twice, and BOTH times they mixed me right up.  I even recommend my boyfriend go there for a knee problem and they were able to help him out too.  Since then I have recommended many other friends and family and they have reported positive results as well.  Wonderful experience.
5 I am an actor and was in Toronto for a few months working on a production. The show I was working on was a highly physical one and I would constantly suffer from joint pain and muscle fatigue. I had a friend suggest seeing a chiropractor about my injuries but I was highly skeptical. The pain became a lot to deal with on a day-to-day basis and I decided to hold my skepticism and meet with someone. Dr. Ritza came well recommended so I met with him to discuss what I was going through. During our consultation he recommended electro-acupuncture as a way to help ease the pain. I had always been a bit taken back by the practice of acupuncture (let alone "electro-acupuncture) but decided that it was worth a try.   Dr. Ritza explained everything to me from a medical perspective but in a practical way that I could understand it. I never saw how using a needle on the skin could stimulate an effect in my muscles but after breaking down the cause and effect behind it I fully trusted the practice of acupuncture as legitimate. Dr. Ritza explained to me that I may not see results right away but I should not let that get me discouraged. Fortunately enough, I began seeing results, to a small extent, the very next day. I proceeded to see Dr. Ritza twice a week for about a month. As the weeks progressed I felt the muscles around my knee to be stronger and that the pain had subsided a great deal because of it.  After being happy with my progression Dr. Ritza suggested to take a few weeks off from having a session to see how I would maintain. I was weary about doing this after being so confident about the results I had been having but he assured me that I could schedule an appointment at any time if I needed it and he made his email available to me if I had any questions or concerns. The knowledge Dr. Ritza showed and the quality of care he provided was first class. His personality and demeanor made him incredibly approachable. I would recommend Dr. Ritza to anyone experiencing the same kind of trouble I was having. Even if you find yourself skeptical about chiropractic practice or the use of acupuncture I urge you to at least schedule an appointment with Dr. Ritza first. You won't be disappointed.
4 Massage packages: 5 1-hr massages for $200 or 3 for $135  Located in quiet business park just south of the Kierland shopping center, this business can be difficult to find.  I was happy with the availability of appointments and the ease of getting an appointment.  My therapist was professional and thorough.  I plan on purchasing a package of 3 during my next visit to take advantage of the package discount
5 I am truly glad I found Velda Rose Medical and especially Doctor Mark Goldberg.  There are two types of Doctors, the ones who care, and the ones who don't, Dr Goldberg cares. He's good at what he does AND as a bonus, he cares, rare to find that these days. To me, he's worth the wait. He's proven it to me and my family time and time again.   I think the other reviews are old, the staff is friendly and the wait wasn't long at all. A+
5 Dr.Dave came to Cali to personally fit my new orthotics. I've suffered with back pain for years. As a celebrity hair & makeup artist it's important to have the strength & stability. Thank you Dr. Dave your the best!
5 I was very impressed with the service, friendliness and speed of the staff. I was in an out within one hour. I came from CA and my insurance, Kaiser, was taken. I only paid the copy of $10, my insurance told me ahead of time. I went in with a bad back pain and the nurse practitioner looked up every medication I was taking, to make sure, any Rx that might be prescribed , would not interact with each other. Very satisfied!! They gave me back exercises  and advice. They could not prescribe another medication because of the strength of the one I am already taking!
5 This is a small practice where the doctor takes his time and establishes a personal relationship. His staff is fantastic-  Ivan is very professional, and Abeni has the office very well organized. With a small office, you do get a bit of a weird setup, I agree with other comment, but Dr. Waltman is the real deal-   there are not 60 patients waiting, and you don't feel rushed with him. I am a new patient, who is there just for wellness, not illness, and the doc still had great questions and suggestions to me about how to STAY healthy. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a personal, intimate experience.
5 Okay, they partially get 5 stars since I've never had any other PT experience to make a comparison to.  I'm rounding the corner on the end of my physical therapy for my shoulder injury.  From the initial visit to the PT sessions, everything has been effortless.  I've never been made to wait an unreasonable amount of time past my appointment time, and I've even been taken in early more times than not.  The physical therapy sessions all start with heat therapy for about 15 minutes before jumping into a series of exercises tailored for your injuries.  Most of the time you are working with the PT assistants and they all seem very personable and friendly.  The physical therapist also does some manual manipulation of whichever broken part you have at the end to check the progress.  They also offer ice at the end of each session and a paper explanation of home exercises that need to be performed.  The best part especially for those who are working, they have extended hours making it easy to pop over after work to fit in a session.  I would definitely recommend this place or the multiple locations they have for anyone needing physical therapy.
5 Great office staff. They are all very friendly and Paula the Nurse Practitioner is great, very thorough. I would recommend this office as a primary care provider.
1 This is THE worst doctors office I have ever been to. The staff is rude, the place is always overcrowded. And it takes forever to be seen, and usually by a PA or NP never a doctor.  I had to change my insurance, I had told the girl on the phone when I made an appointment, and I told the girl upon check-in. Filled out m new insurance paperwork and they STILL charged my old insurance.   They over-charge on basic blood work (charged me 200 dollars, while I got blood work at a different doctor's office and they charged 40 dollars). You also have to make an appointment to find out the results of anything, and then they charge your insurance.   DO NOT GO THERE
1 Zero Stars! Dr. Wachs is overshadowed by her staff and practices. I went there a few times simply because of proximity. Always had some sort of issues with billing. My insurance is top notch and covers just about anything and after paying my co-pay, somehow this office screws something up and sends you to collections immediately EVERY TIME!!!!  Now im getting harrassed by an even shittier company over $60 for something that i have paid. If your health and credit are an importance to you, take your business elsewhere. The staff here should all be fired.
5 As a general rule I am not a big fan of chiropractics though I have gone to them several times over the years in desperation. Two days ago I was just putting my bike rack on my vehicle and out of no where I almost went down to the floor with a sudden pain in the side of my lower back.  Yesterday, I saw my primary care physician who prescribed a muscle relaxer and a pain med. A neighbor saw my painful situation and suggested I see Dr. Teusink. I was absolutely desperate as I have never in my life experienced such pain.  I was barely able to get in and out of my car and walking was very painful. Then there were the back spasms that took away my breath and just about dropped me to the floor in pain.  This morning I hobbled into Dr. Teusink's office. I could not lie down on his regular table but he had this other table that took me from standing to down without me having to do any moving.  He pushed and poked and did his magic along with some acupuncture which I never had that before. I didn't care what he did as long as he fixed me. About 20 or so minutes later I was almost able to get off the table by myself.  In summary, when I went into his office the patients in the waiting room watched as I could barely stand and walk to get into the examining room on my own. Then 20 minutes later watched as I walked out on my own. I was able to get in and out of my car with minimal discomfort.  I am still resting my back and have a follow up visit tomorrow. I can now get around the house myself and no longer have the breath wrenching spasms. On a side note, Dr. Teusink has a great bedside manner and his staff is great.  In summary, I would highly recommend Dr.Teusink to anyone.
5 Another great visit. Saw Dr. Delatte, she answered all my questions and concerns and put me back on the right path. They were willing to help get my medications covered with a prior auth and were helpful in helping with another prescription that was a better price cash pay than my regular copay. Great place. They take the time that is needed. Whether it be 15 minutes or an hour, you get what you need!
5 Zingara Orthopedic Muscle therapy is a great place with very friendly helpful staff! It's in a great location in old town Scottsdale and very easy to find. The massage room is very well put together and it seemed very peaceful.  I have struggled with body pain for a while mainly from being on my feet at work and golfing. Suiz gives a massage like I have never had before! She is very knowledgeable about how the body works and where the pain is coming from. This is not regular deep tissue massage it's much more thorough and is great for someone with sports injury.   She worked out the knots in legs for a long time but the 90 minutes still left plenty of time for the rest of the body. The message left me feeling like i had never felt before, it felt like my body was adjusted and she helped my posture not only for golf but everyday life.  She told me to take things easy for at least a day after and I did feel some pain but a few days later a felt great. I will defiantly be going back. It's great bang for the buck for this kind of bodywork!
5 Cant say enough about Dr. Matt and the team at Arcadia Health and Wellness. Like some, I was a little apprehensive about having my back adjusted. Without hesitation Dr. Matt suggested a low intensity machine for my needs. It has been over two months and I have not felt any of the pain I had been feeling in my back previously. Furthermore, he helped tremendously with a shoulder injury I sustained in the Gym. Dr. Matt genuinely cares about his patients and will custom tailor treatments depending on the needs of the client.
5 I've been at appointments for only a short time but I already feel better and can stand with better posture. Thank you Dr. Cuttita and office staff for being so polite and helpful!
2 Horribly long wait time...going on 2 hours now. I hate that pre-employment physical exams are only perform at Concentra nowadays. I would never come here otherwise. The two stars goes to the excellent customer service from the front desk and the waters/coffees/teas readily available on a clean counter.  Side note: pre-employment physical exams are walk-ins only. And no time seems to be a good time because they service appointments first.   Ridiculous.
5 I've seen several practitioners here and have been impressed with the services by all:  Dr Lindsay Self, Naturopath, helped treat a hormone imbalance I had last year.  Within a month, my symptoms pretty much dissipated and things were back to normal.  I've seen 2/3 of the RMTs here and all have been very helpful in pin-pointing causes for pain and alleviating it in the short term.  One of them recommended me to the chiro on staff (Dr Wade Phillips), who was able to help rid a chronic cycling injury that was leading to all the tension.  All-in-all, I'm happy with my results from all practitioners. (Just be careful not to let the appointment suggestions rake up and the bills escalate.)
5 Dr. Jason's location is very convenient and he offers many different services, including cryotherapy. Furthermore, I love that you can book your appointment online, which saves time! I recommend you check this place out!
1 Called Nelson to set up an evaluation. They told me the co-pay was 8 dollars. Then I got charged 200 for the co-pay. Of course I called to find out how on earth it went from 8 dollars to 200 and Wendy said "well if he had autism it would have been 8 dollars. Most of our children have a mental disability". I didn't even have it in me to fight it, and yes WE HAVE PRIVATE INSURANCE. If your child does not have a mental issue. Just put them in daycare. The other children will lead by example and it'll cost you a hell of a lot less. My son has been in daycare for 4 days and he's talking and u just fine. Imagine how much it would have cost me for the recommended 6 months/1 a week of therapy. UPDATE: So I called blue cross to see why this wasn't covered. They explained that it was showing as physical therapy and not speech therapy. So him having no mental delay had nothing to do with why it wasn't cover. I called Nelson and spoke with Jackie and relayed the info and asked her to call BCBS and she told me "no, I called yesterday".....ok so I called BCBS again and they fixed the issue for me. So I called Jackie again and told her I would be disputing the charge and suddenly she's was able to call BCBS and reverse the charge. AMAZING how that works.
5 I was referred to this clinic and Dr. Michelle Kang after a car accident. The clinic is very clean and at a very convenient location and staff are very professional and friendly. Dr. Michelle Kang was very knowledgeable and provided me with excellent treatments every single time. I have been to other chiropractors in the past throughout the years and I find Dr. Kang to be the best in addressing the specific problems I had. Strong recommendations.
5 So here's my story of how I ended up as a patient of Horizon Spine & Sport.  I was in a minor car accident a few months ago and I developed some neck and upper back pain and well, that sucked.  I ask my friends who are chiropractic aficionados who they would refer me to and I'm directed to Dr. Chuck Badger.  I can't speak personally for the other doctor at this practice as all my treatment has been provided by Dr. Badger.    Sorry Yelpers (not really sorry), but when it comes to medical professionals, you are not my first resource for research.  Perhaps more reviews like this will change that for future Yelp seekers.   After a really easy initial appointment set-up with Janine (the office coordinator extraordinaire), I come in and see Dr. Badger.    They have appointments after standard business hours!  This is is super helpful for those of us that work 9a-5p, so I don't have to take time off of work for my three times per week chiropractic appointments.   What I appreciated most about Dr. Badger on the initial consultation was the time taken to explain the spine and the muscles and the effects of trauma and how these could be remedied with treatment.  I am one of those patients that likes to be educated on what is going on, and I believe that an educated patient is a compliant patient.  If you tell me "because I said so", well, I'm going to tell you to kick rocks (with open-toed shoes) and seek treatment elsewhere.   Initial consultation comes and goes and treatment commences!  Prior to seeing Dr. Badger, I'd never received chiropractic care so having things explained to me as they happened was greatly appreciated.  He addressed the pain and injuries caused by the car accident and he also treated pain related to your standard desk job (which was exacerbated in the car accident).   On more than one occasion, I have dozed off on the table when receiving electrical muscle stimulation in my upper back, thanks to the low lights and quiet of the office. And Dr. Badger is a huge sports fan so inevitably you will see a game on the flat screen TVs (one in the lobby and one by the treatment tables) so if you don't end up napping, you can catch a few plays.  This falls in line with his practice taking care of athletes injuries, too.    After several months of successful treatment, I'm nearly discharged.  I feel significantly better than when I started treatment, and probably better than I did even before the car accident, and that's due to Dr. Badger's skill as a chiropractor.  Dr. Badger has a great manner with patients, from young to old and from athletes to car accident patients and all in between, I have only ever seen him be pleasant with all.    That pleasant demeanor is also expressed by Janine who is great in her own right.  Ever deal with nasty staff at a great doctor's office that you're hesitant to return to the great doctor because the staff is so nasty? That will never be the case here.   Horizon Spine & Sport is a top-notch practice and I would recommend them to anyone seeking chiropractic care.
2 I called three days ago about me having a UTI. I never heard back so i call again today and they girl on the phone tells me that there is no communication in the computer to show i called three days ago, and, there are no appointments today so she suggest i go to urgent care.    Do not expect the office staff to care about you at this office.   Did not know how crappy healthcare is here in Arizona.   My doctor in Oregon would just have me leave a urine sample and they would test it and call in a prescription.  But oh no, not here in Arizona, they have to SEE you for an office visit (money grab) and you have to pay your copay. Just for them to dip a test strip in your urine while you sit in the room for 45 minutes.  That time could be given to someone who actually needs to see the doctor and not just a dip test in urine.
5 Dr. Kinel by far is the best primary care doctor I've gone to. He doesn't have a medical assistant so he is the first person to see you once you're in the examination room. He listens and has a calm, unhurried manner that to a patient means he or she is not just one of many patients in an assembly line.  His office is very clean, quiet and very zen. Dr. Kinel himself is a kind, mild mannered and knowledgeable doctor who restores one's trust in doctors and the medical profession. He is a great physician and I'm glad to have discovered his practice through a friend who highly recommended him.
3 The atmosphere is on the lower end of massage places, but quite a nice version of the chain (I've been to others).  The front desk girl was pleasant and the massages were prompt.  The temperature in the rooms was great and it's very clean.  It's also about as inexpensive as massages get without some kind of deal.    The massage therapists I had were ok - nothing bad, nothing excellent.  The massages felt very nice and helped with immediate tension, but weren't particularly effective as massage "therapy" (my regular place is wonderful for that).    With a physically active life style and sedentary job, there are times when a massage is pretty necessary - tightness or soreness in a particular area can really benefit from it.  This is not a place for that kind of massage, in my opinion.    The therapists were a little chattier than I like (silence is golden during a massage).  I'm sure I should have been a little more clear about my preferences.  If you prefer silence, it's not their default setting, so just let them know.     My husband and I have both been to this location a few times, mostly out of convenience, so this represents multiple experiences.  It's not a fancy place and you don't get a fancy massage, but you also don't pay a fancy price.
1 Ich war damals bei Herr Bosch und war überhaupt nicht zufrieden.er hat einem nicht wirklich zu gehört und wollte mich abwimmeln weil ich noch fragen hatte.ich hab trotz der termin über zwei stunden warten müssen und die schön gestalteten wartezimmer, durch die man muss damit die laaaange wartezeit vergeht,reisen es auch nicht mehr raus.Ich bekam noch einen Allergie test und man hat mich dann im Behandlungszimmer auch noch vergessen :-( Das Personal ist einfach Überlastet...
1 Would give zero stars if possible. Def the most expensive office I've ever been to and I only went here in the first place because of the convenience to my work. They overbill you for everything and the receptionists are extremely rude. I called about a charge on my account and the receptionist hung up on me. I will Not be going back to this place!!!
5 Top Notch Care! I had shoulder shoulder Arthroscopic peformed by the BEST Nathan Richardson!!!! Kind, Gentle, Strong and Professional!! The Staff his assistant/nurse was the Best as well. If I need ANY bodypart worked on suegically it will always be CORE no mattter where I am I will fly back for all my needs..Hopefully no time soon ;-)  The Core Really sticks by it's "core" values...This is the Route folks!!!
5 This place is awesome! The front staff is lovely and the RMT that I had (her name was Zofia) was phenomenal. I came in for a 45 minute relaxation massage and Zofia was able to treat my entire body. Your RMT can also use a heat pad to ease the stress off of your muscles as you're being massaged, I highly recommend it.  They've got showers within the massage rooms so once your done, you get to seal the deal with a nice hot shower.  All in all, great staff, great RMTs and reasonable prices!  Already booked my next appointment :)
5 Stephanie is so sweet.  Love the wraps and so relaxing! You feel totally invigorated every time.
5 Very clean office and the staff is super nice.  Not a long wait at all.  I recommend this place.
1 BEWARE! I have received more than 10 laser hair removal treatments on my full legs with NO RESULTS. The machine might be used but it is not being used correctly by staff. I'm usually in and out in 15 minutes for my full legs which should have been a red flag for me but it wasn't until visiting another laser hair removal spa that I realized Body & Soul Clinic is misusing their machine on clients. Do not visit this spa - do your research and don't make the same mistake that I did. Their prices are cheap for a reason. I am the perfect candidate for laser hair removal and now, after having gone to another laser spa, I had results after ONE SESSION. Don't throw your money away like I did.
5 I read about Egoscue in Tim Ferriss' book, the 4 Hour Body (the section on managing injuries). After decades of being physically active, I was finding myself slowing down dramatically because of injury. Few things make you feel older before your time than pain! Yoga was hurting my mid-back and wrist. Walking and running, my knees. Weightlifting and riding a motorcycle -- my upper back and right elbow. On top of it, I'd been having intermittent stabbing pain in my lower back for over a decade. I didn't want a technique or a prescription or to become dependent on chiropractic visits (anyway, I'd already tried these and they didn't work). I wanted to be empowered to help heal the pain myself. That's exactly what I got with Egoscue.   I met the owner, John Cattermole, when I first arrived at the clinic, but worked directly with Tiffany Czarapata, an exercise therapist. They were warm, friendly, organized, extremely knowledgeable and there was no pressure. Tiffany is a pro through and through -- focused, super-smart, detail-minded, thorough, patient, compassionate, and an excellent listener. She understood my concerns and made the exercise easy to grasp (especially important since I'd be doing them at home on my own).   I don't believe in magical solutions -- especially for problems like pain that evolve over many years -- but I did experience significant pain relief after doing the exercises for less than week. We're adjusting the exercise plan as we go, based on my body's response, and that's been great too -- you don't feel you've been abandoned with a handout, you really feel they're there for you right to the end.   The exercises "awaken" muscles that have gone "offline" from underuse/immobility so it feels like your body is coming alive again (no pain!!!). I'm frankly amazed but mostly relieved.  No one asked me to write a review but I just had to tell everyone. Yeah, I guess you could say I'm a convert.
4 I had a great experience at Jackson physical therapy after recent back injury where I was referred by my physician Dr. Rosler. From the first phone call I made, to when I walked out the door the staff made my visit easy and comfortable.   I was offered paperwork e-mailed to me ahead of time, I was offered an option an appointment days and times, the receptionist was friendly on the phone and very kind upon my arrival. My future appointments were set up quickly, and even though my appointment time seem to be at 'rush hour' you would never have known.  The main physical therapist taking care of me is Kevin Thomason. He takes his time and listens to what I have to say about my recent injury and was careful about what I could do and not do during the appointment and afterward at home. Kevin is personable and explains exactly how he relates to injuries having had injuries himself. So he knows exactly what you're going through.   He always told me what to expect during the appointment and after I left, he informed me who would be seeing me on one of the days I was scheduled but he was off work.  I guess if I have an off comment to make it would be that the front desk is a bit tall. I know that sounds a little weird, but doing businesslike payments and paperwork across the desk so high made me feel awkward. It was a bit like the places you go to where they have the window that they slide. Just kind of a strange set up for atmosphere upon arrival.
1 Our experience at this Urgent Care was hardly URGENT. If anything, the service was incredibly lazy and casual. We waited in the waiting room for an hour and a half with another 5 patients, and waited in the doctor's office for another hour. I have incredibly uncomfortable sickness symptoms, and didn't appreciate waiting for two hours while having the chills, nausea, painful congestion, explosive diarrhea, etc. I never usually make Yelp reviews, but this was extreme enough that I felt the need to warn others who don't want to wait two hours to be helped.
5 Great practice all around, very friendly and caring staff, comfortable office.  I've been a regular patient since around 5/16 and have seen a lot of improvement (stress-induced knots in neck and shoulders).  Dr Mioni offers insight to back up his diagnoses and treatments, answers all your questions, and really puts you at ease during adjustments.  Very easy to get in for appointments, and they are sympathetic to nervous patients.  Highly recommend!
1 If you do not suffer from high blood pressure, Clinica La Familia will change that!  I did not visit this location.  I visited the location on west 59th ave in Glendale.  However, the service that was offered to me is without a doubt the absolute worst service that I have ever received as a Medical Patient.  The owner, head doctor, he is a wonderful person but this is one of the worst run medical offices that I have ever been to.  I saw one other doctor, Alex, while I was a patient, and he is incompetent at best; lacking the experience necessary to be an effective physician.  As bad as the patient care is, I do not sense any sense of pride in providing good, adequate service from the receptionists, or from the managers, who do a poor job of setting appointments, being truthful with relaying expectations, and making sure that the doctors are set up for a successful office visit.    A star is not even necessary.  If you can afford to go see a better doctor, or have the time to wait another doctor out, avoid Clinica La Famila.
3 It's a chiropractor.  They'll set you up on as many visits as they can, even if you don't necessarily need it, like any other chiropractor.  For me it was 5 minutes of stretching, 2 minutes of adjustments, and 5 minutes of electro therapy (or whatever it's called), all for like $60.  I just stretch on my own now and avoid obvious stressors on my neck and lower back, probably could have been suggested after visit 2.  Can't say I didn't feel better after the first adjustment, but it just wasn't worth sticking to a 6 week program.  Some people swear by chiropractors, while others claim they are frauds.  Guess it depends on your situation and chiropractor, but id say these guys are probably better than your average group.
1 If it wasn't for my daughter liking Dr. Forte, my family members would have been gone long ago, and have been patients for over ten years.  The rudest office staff anywhere and the  nurse that calls you back has no business interacting with patients at all.  She acts like she is totally put out tending to your needs.  Such an attitude should never be allowed in any office setting let alone the medical field.  Really, are staff that treat people decently that hard to find? If my name was displayed on the building I would be very concerned and taking steps for immediate changes.
5 As someone who almost never gets massages and is a bit awkward about the whole thing, Adelaide West made me feel really comfortable and incredibly relaxed.    I received a gift certificate for my birthday last January and only now got around to using it.  I honestly regret waiting so long.  The staff is very friendly and accommodating, and they take the time to tailor the session towards your needs.  The 1 hour massage I received did wonders to loosen up years of stress and tension and I walked away feeling beyond relaxed.  I'd recommend this place to anyone who needs an injury tended to or even just someone looking for a great way to relax and de-stress.  It will not be another 11 months before i go back!
5 I had the best experience with Leavitt Physical therapy - I genuinely can't think of a more caring and helpful PT than Jeff. It's evident that he genuinely cares about his patients, and had me feeling better after one treatment! The whole place is clean and welcoming. I was originally referred to a different place by my insurance, but I'm glad I went with my gut and took the advice of a friend who also has gone to Leavitt Physical Therapy. It was a great experience all around!
1 Took my spouse in this morning for back spasms at 9am when they opened. We completed all the paper work before we arrived as they said this would shorten the wait time. After 1 hour and 15 minutes I realized people who came in after us were being called in to see the doctor; my husband said he couldn't sit any longer and walked out the door. I went to the desk and ask the receptionist why others were going in ahead of him, she said "well, he didn't sign in on the sheet"; I asked her if she told him he needed to sign in, she looked at me perplexed and didn't respond. Now that's some BAD customer service!!! Get your stuff together ladies. Bad, Bad, Bad.   We left, went to another urgent care facility and was seen by the doctor in less than 15 minutes.
4 Very friendly staff, helpful and smooth transition form other place! I wish they had separate entrances for the sick kids bc everyone comes into same area and my well appointment on Wednesday had an Eric visit on Thursday. But it happens
5 When it comes to all inclusive chiropractic care, Dr. Dom is as good as it gets!  I came to Arcadia Health and Wellness on a recommendation from a good friend of mine. She has been singing Dr. Dom's accolades for years, and she was confident that he could "fix my migraine problem".  I'll be honest, I was completely skeptical as I've had migraines for years that no other chiropractor had been able to fix.  However, because she was so emphatic about his abilities I decided that it was worth a shot and booked an appointment with him.    Lesson learned? Never doubt my friend. :)  Since beginning care with Dr. Dom and his massage staff, I am now migraine free for 4+ months and have never felt better!  Not only have my migraines dissipated, but my posture has improved, and overall I'm feeling much more balanced and strong.    Dr. Dom is AMAZING and I 100% recommend seeing him and his staff for your chiropractic care!!  Trust me; your body will thank you for it ;)
5 I've had the opportunity to be treated by a number of the awesome providers at AZSDS and I must say I was super impressed, figuring I have a ton of issues.  The chiropractic treatments were so much more than just a sit or lay here, adjustment, and a "thanks and see you later".   The entire experience consisted of a comprehensive exam, X-Rays, e-STIM, soft tissue work (ART specifically), and THEN the actual manual adjustment which made my lower back pain go away completely.  I also received treatment from Jody Murray, the office's Acupuncturist and Athletic Trainer, which was another awesome experience.  Since I've never had acupuncture done to me before, I was unsure of what to expect.  Needless to say, I will be going back.  Jody conducted an examination on me prior to treatment using a neat little device that gave a detailed report on areas of my body that were not functioning at optimal levels and highlighted issues that I hadn't even told her about yet.  After the treatment, for the first time in I couldn't tell you how long, I actually felt like my feet and lower body were connected to the ground and "on".  Later that day I went to workout and felt like a whole new person.  Would highly recommend meeting with Jody.    The PT department was also great.  I learned a ton of what my body was NOT doing and the compensations that I had created to make up for weak and non functioning parts of my body.  Being an avid lifter, I thought that I had pretty good control of my body, but apparently not so much (thanks Dr. Whipple).  And the best part; I actually saw the PT unlike so many other offices that I've been to in the past.    Over all, AZSDS is a great office.  If you're looking to relieve pain and get back on the right track, I would highly recommend it.
5 I was very alarmed when I read all the reviews.  I still went into the office and I was surprised. I had to wait a little bit but not too long and they updated me every few minutes.  I clearly understand that my first response if someone cut my pain meds down would be anger, but after a while I am sooooo much happier. Less groggy. Can do my daily activities. Etc.   Sometimes a good doctor will do things against our will for our own good. That is a real doctor.   Addiction is a horrible thing. Don't take your issues on a caring doctor.
5 i have been taking my grandma there for over 2 month's and that staff has been great the girl's that do the massage rob her therapist is great and kim and the people that work in the gym are great and there all so  loving and caring and super funny my grandma love coming there and she thinks that mike that works there is a little nut's and super funny and my grandma only speaks spanish and love that some of the people that work there speak spanish including renae  and that she is really nice fun and caring person she loves going there
1 I went here after I had a serious fall and direct blow to my elbow. The emergency room referred me to the Core Institute with a possible fracture. When I went in for my appointment, the X-ray tech was very rude and unwilling to help me by explaining how he wanted me to twist my arm for the scans. When I asked if I had it correct, he seemed very aggravated. While in the exam room, a very nice nurse cut my splint off and offered me a pillow to prop up my arm. That was about the greatest ounce of courtesy I received. When the doctor came in, she seemed very confused as to why I was there. She said she saw no fracture and to make a follow up appointment for 2 weeks, but my elbow would probably be fine by then and I would probably end up canceling it. Rude! She also had her PA look at the X-ray and he made a comment about how he could zoom into the X-ray as much as he could and maybe find a little scuff on the bone that probably wasn't from the fall. They offered me more pain killers but warned me of how addictive they are and to only take them if I was in pain. Really I felt totally blown off and like my pain wasn't real.  Fast forward to two weeks later, I kept my appointment I had made but I went to see a different doctor at the Core. I was in the exam room for maybe 2 minutes. The doctor glanced at my elbow X-ray and told me to start physical therapy. He didn't look at my elbow, feel it, or even ask anything about it. At least with this visit I felt like I got somewhere: physical therapy.   I didn't do my physical therapy with the Core, but was planning on going back for another reevaluation due to my continuing elbow pain and issues (silly to go back, I know). I ended up going to see a different doctor not at the Core and I didn't have my X-rays from the Core with me so they had to take new ones....guess what! A fracture! Plain as day! Right where the emergency room said it was! I feel like I have totally wasted my time and money at the Core. I also feel that it has really put me back in where I should be in the healing process because I was made to feel like what I was feeling was no big deal or "normal." And this is 3 months later!  Never would I recommend going to the Core!
5 I have nothing but good things to say about Verve. The staff has always been very kind to me and I've never waited very long for an appointment even when I've just walked in for an adjustment. I have been going there for 4.5 years now and will continue, as will many people I know. They are respectful and caring as well as knowledgeable and efficient.
1 Waited 45 minutes to be seen for my consultation. Only to find out they don't do what the receptionist ASSURED ME OVER THE PHONE they do.
5 I had been searching for something to inspire me and kick me back into working out regularly and after having a baby 7 months earlier, I couldn't seem to get motivated. Then I had noticed a friend and his checkins on Facebook and thought 'I should try that....if he's seeing progress maybe it'll help me!'  I started seeing ads pop up on my page and it was the answer I needed! I joined right away. I didn't know what to expect when I arrived at my first workout. I was scared and nervous to get started working out but soon realized that my trainer (Regina was awesome, btw!) allowed us to go at our pace and kept us motivated and going. Soon, I had lost 3 lbs then another 4lbs and so on. I was getting so excited about my progress that I didn't want to fail and didn't want to eat anything that wasn't on the meal plan. The only thing I hated was that I hadn't completely lost what I needed to by week 5 and had to resort to an emergency diet. Thankfully it went by quickly. I have finished my challenge successfully and lost more than I needed to. I can't thank Kirk & Regina & crew enough for the motivation needed to get me psyched about working out again! Today, even though I've finished my challenge, I meal prepped like I had during the challenge and will be working out at 6am. I'm ready to continue my journey. Thanks Heroic Fitness!!!
2 The staff were rude including the PA. They are quick to to see you but the care is unprofessional if they were unprofessional when I questioned the different information I was receiving from the receptionist and the PA. I had to revisit due to pain medication not working and I asked is there anything else I could take instead. She accused me of wanting her to prescribe medication without knowing my test results. That was not the reason for my visit, she just assumed based on what the receptionist told her when I called earlier and asked to speak with the person who treated me so I could understand something.  I would not go back here because they recognized my name when they called the next day and because they were still rude and short on the phone. That is unprofessional.
5 Dr. Boothe is fantastic! He worked hard to fit me into his schedule and was able to see me the same day. I was having horrible pain in my neck and right shoulder. The minute walked in I knew I'd made a great choice! He was warm, friendly, very personable, and genuinely cared about helping me feel better.  He did some deep tissue massage, stretching, and an adjustment. The next day I was 90% better. It was amazing.  In many places, you feel like you are being run through their "system". Not here, Dr. Boothe's focused attention and personalized assessment and  treatment of my specific symptoms made me feel like I was his only patient! I highly recommend Dr. Boothe and PROCARE Spine and Sports Therapy!!
1 i took my dog to the pet clinic and its the biggest joke and scam of any vet in phoenix!!!!!!!! stay away.  they charge you more than they quote you on the phone and they are simply a scam.  could care less about the animals only care about cashing in on your pet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! stay away!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i recommend any vet in phx over these con artists!
5 I've been getting chiropractic care for almost 25 years, and this office is truly one of the best.  The entire staff is outstanding, and Dr Christopher is an extremely skilled chiropractor.  I highly recommend this office!
5 Been attending Lyons physical therapy for almost 3 months now. The staff is extremely attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. They take their time to assess every patients' personal needs and goals. My strength has improved tremendously and pain has diminished. I would highly recommend this facility for anyone who is contemplating physical therapy. Misty is my favorite!
1 Disgusting and unprofessional treatment of patients. Haphazardly signing off scripts for unwanted medications, ignoring repeated phonecalls for a week straight trying to set things straight... I cannot stress enough how unbelievably dangerous it is to just give out scripts for dangerous drugs like Xanax over the phone to people who do not even want it. Treating illnesses by irresponsibly throwing drugs at it is the exact reason why millions of Americans struggle with prescription drug addiction. Thanks Dr. Hailstone, you rock.
5 After I completed 10 weeks of physical therapy I started taking Pilates rehab classes from Heather.  I take three classes per week from Heather and hope to continue classes for years to come.  Heather is an outstanding, creative and very conscientious instructor.  She is aware of all students injuries and special situations and tailors the class accordingly and yet all class members get a great workout.  While she is teaching she is continually circulating among the students to be sure each person is doing the exercises correctly and with proper form.  I have taken Pilates classes from several instructors in Las Vegas and in my opinion  Heather is the best.
1 If you're thinking about going here, do yourself a favor and DON'T. My family has been going to see Dr Izenberg since I was very young. He is awesome! He recently moved in with the Velda Rose staff however, and thanks to THEM, will never come back. Too many games of phone tag because they won't answer during business hours and only called back while I was working (even though I specified in multiple messages which times I would be available during their hours), not being told what I'm being treated for (no symptoms, just high white blood cell count in yearly urine sample. NP didn't mention a UTI or anything, the MA just came back with a rx and told me to come back), being told there was "no charge" for the multiple follow up urine tests and then getting a bill for them six months later... When I called the billing dept today, they essentially told me to suck it up and pay because the girls up front don't always know if I have insurance or not. I told the front desk at the time of each of the tests that I did NOT have insurance, and they still told me I was good to go and didn't have to pay. As much as I loved Dr Izenberg, I am so done putting up with the utter incompetence of other staff members.
5 I have been going to this practice for three years and have consistently received excellent customer service and treatment. The entire staff is always very friendly and I see them go out of their way for elderly customers and treat them exceptionally nice. The treatment is always excellent and their rates are the best in town! To add to it, they are very kid friendly if you need to bring your kid to your appointment, they have coloring books and snacks.  Although I try to stay away from receiving treatment, I can always count on these guys, especially Mark with the spicy meatball!
1 I went to see Dr. Wedlow for some blood work and such.  I guess she seemed competent enough, but not once did she make eye contact with me.  Also, she acted very uninterested in some issues I am having and made me feel like just another number.  Drive-through experience.
1 I called to ask if I could pick up my medical records and blood test results from the staff and the woman on the phone says she'll call me back in a few minutes. An hour goes by and I call back at 4:30; I ask again if I can pick up my things, and she says that the only people that can help me clocked out at 4:30, but they'll call me back in the morning. Again, I have to call them back the next morning and they say they need to email me a release form and they can just email me my records, and they still haven't emailed me, even though I've called them about it multiple times. Glad I'm leaving this place to find somewhere else to go.
5 I like to think of myself as fit and fairly active. I mean who wouldn't after taking boot camp classes three times a week, for what seems like years? That false sense of confidence is exactly what inspired me to sign up for a TRX/Yoga class at Forza. Don't worry, I dragged a friend along with me so that we could both take advantage of the $5 introductory class offer.   The facility is clean and cheerful, with perfectly sized cubbies for shoes and purses. Donna greeted us at the door at made us feel welcome. Being newbies to TRX, she patiently explained the bands and what fitness benefits they can provide using your own body weight. The hourlong class was filled with Donna giving instructions and demonstrating the yoga techniques using TRX to upbeat music. She walked around the room and gave feedback to everyone, well mostly me, on their proper form and positioning. I was glad she helped me get the workout I came for, but disappointed that I'm not as graceful and coordinated as I like to think I am.   I definitely got what I bargained for with the workout. I was so sore for days after working muscles that I didn't even know I had. I felt less discouraged later when I learned that TRX was invented by a Navy Seal to get a workout in remote locations. The facility also includes bikes for high-intensity cycling classes, that Donna told us beginners can do, but I doubt my coordination can handle those.
1 I took class twice with Leena and I wish I could recommend her but I can't. Once I took class with her when she taught at a yoga studio in Las Vegas and another time I took class with her on the Strip (I was a dancer with one of the production shows). I did not really enjoy my classes with Leena as I felt her classes weren't challenging at all. I wasn't looking for an advanced class, just a good stretch, and I didn't feel like I benefitted physically when her class was over. I have taken classes with many other yoga instructors in Las Vegas and feel that there are far better teachers around.
5 Great staff.  Excellent service! Dr. Herrera was a great choice for our family doctor
5 I received a Groupon as a gift and I can tell you that there haven't been many better gifts before. Andrew (remember that name) was absolutely incredible. I went in wth a very sore lower back and came out an hour later pain-free and totally relaxed. His focus and method was perfect and I'll be back to see him. I suggest you do to!!!
5 I have been going to this practice for over 10 years now. In the past I may have had some bad things to say as far as the long waits and other petty criticisms. Now that I have gotten to know all of the doctors and nurse practitioners I have seen that this practice really works hard to please their patients. On behalf of my care I have absolutely nothing negative to say about any of the health care providers. The nurse practitioner Neerja is by far my first choice to be seen by and then I would say dr schlotterback. If you are looking for a family dr I highly recommend Gilbert center for family medicine.
1 Dr. Smith Worst doctor ever do not go you want to waste your time and money then I suggest you go. Not to mention I have insurance.  What a loser he is.
5 This place is fantastic.  I have been told by multiple doctors that the pain I'm experiencing due to an injury is pretty much permanent.  I'm 24 and my options are major surgery with no guarantee to fix, or being stuck on very strong pain killers every night.  I have been suffering with this pain for over 2 years and felt completely hopeless.  Since starting treatment here, my whole life has changed.  I can be active again, I can work without counting down the minutes to get home and on a muscle relaxer, I can live my life.  I am a former massage therapist as well and very picky about my LMT'S.  This is the first clinic I've come to where I've enjoyed a massage by every LMT on staff.  The staff is knowledgable and friendly, and I feel safe having my care in their hands.  If I could rate them higher than 5 stars I absolutely would.
1 The doctors and PAs I've seen are all fine but the billing department is the worst I've come across.   I've been going for a couple years, paying my bills as I receive them always.  Then I received a bill they claim was 5 months overdue.  They claim to have sent me five previous bills.  As soon as I got the bill in the mail I called, no answer, left a msg, no response.  I called back and talked to someone who was very rude.  I asked to have the $25 late fee removed since I've always paid my bills on time with them.  Just to paint a picture, my bill was for $13 and I paid it.  I refused to pay the late fee when this was the first notice for it.  They sent that $25 to collection and I'll take a hit on my credit before I pay them.  So they've lost the business of not only me but my husband, family member and two friends I've sent their way in the past.  I hope these doctors realize how much business they lose when their billing department screws it up for them.
5 This place is wonderful.  My husband and I are big fans of therapeutic massage.  I prefer a moderate pressure while my husband prefers deep tissue pressure.  They have been able to accommodate both of us.  We joined their membership program, which we really appreciate.  The therapists and receptionists are very friendly and professional.
5 I have been a patient of Dr. Brad Sorosky for several years.  I am not exaggerating by stating that he and his practice have allowed me to return to a level of fitness and health that I was told I would never again achieve.  When I initially went to Dr. Brad, I found him to be a partner in my recovery.  He always listened to my concerns, gave me several options to address issues and always made me feel like I was of utmost importance whenever I was in his office.  I also have seen Dr. Susan Sorosky and can't say enough about her talent in quickly identifying the root cause of an issue.  I went to three doctors who were uncertain of diagnosis and at my first visit, she identified the cause which was later confirmed by MRI.   Additionally both doctors and their office have actively fought to ensure I received insurance approval for appropriate diagnostic testing and treatment.   And Kristy at the East Valley office has always been incredibly kind when I have had a bad flare up and called when in pain.  The epidural injections have been a lifesaver for me.   I have referred numerous friends and family members and they have all thanked me for the referral. Hands down the best physicians and office in their field.
5 Today was my first day of therapy not knowing what to expect and nervous. The staff is very outgoing and helpful and will answer any questions that you may have.    I will say this I did wait but that is to be expected, you don't just walk right in when you see the DR. others being late does push times back and we live in a world of instant gratification I was more then happy to wait and have made my appointments for the month out   I look forward to my recovery here
5 Christy saved my life!!!!  I lost 33 pounds in 3 months and no longer have hot flashes!!!  I feel 20 year younger!!!!
5 Dr. Ben Palmer is attentive, knowledgeable, and cares about your health.  He will identify your issues and come up with a comprehensive plan for recovery, wellness, and preventive care.  I have seen Dr. Palmer for knee and shoulder issues since the beginning of M1.  He has helped me to understand the underlying issues causing pain and/or lack of mobility.  I have had Rock Tape applied, been through several sessions of cryotherapy, and given exercises for recovery.  Patient centered care is what I have experienced.  Thank you Dr. Palmer and M1 Movement.
4 Doc was caring and actually concerned, took the time to discuss my medical history. The office was clean, quiet, and effecient. I was in and out for my annual physical in less than 30 minutes.  Note: give yourself an extra few minutes before your appointment to locate the office within the building, it is kind of a maze.
5 I bought a groupon in May for BYT. I was looking for a way to exercise that I would stick to as I used to work out for a couple days a week for a week and then not work out for three weeks and repeat. BYT is only a few miles away from where I live. My first class was with Audrey, and without her positive energy I don't know if I would have come back. I didn't think the first class was horrible, and I did come back within the recommended 24 hours. I've found that I prefer some instructors over others, so I just go to the classes that they're teaching. I've never felt that I was being yelled at or pushed too far though- you're encouraged to lay down if you feel too ill. I went 2-3 times a week while my groupon was active, and then decided to go to the Scottsdale studio for a month as they had a deal.   Compared to the Scottsdale one, BYT is much cleaner, more friendly, larger, lacks the smell of sweat. I was so happy to come back to BYT even though it was more expensive. I find the staff to be friendly and very open to questions after class. True, some instructors may not correct you as much as others, but if that's the case, find the instructors you like best. Now I go 4-5 times a week. I've lost 10 pounds (which ended up being 2 dress sizes) and no longer need to do physical therapy for my upper back and neck. The bump on the back of my neck from looking down at a computer screen and books is gone. I don't feel as stressed as I did 5 months ago.  If you want to practice Bikram in the Valley, start here.
5 Best of the best! World class everything. Jessie and Logan are both amazing in the PT dept! Highly recommend
1 First off I would like to state that this review is based on my boyfriends experience; I saw Dr. Dicke for my anxiety and my TMJ and he gave me what I needed to cope with these issues.  For my boyfriend however, this was not the case.  My boyfriend had been experiencing extreme pain and concluded that he had one of two issues, one of them being a kidney stone.  He requested a urine sample (which the nurse was happy to give him and even offered) and provided his symptoms; Dr. Dicke told him the urine test was unnecessary.  The next day he is at the emergency room in excruciating pain; some blood work, a urine sample, and an ultrasound later, they inform him that he has a 3mm kidney stone.  Now we have a huge rack up of emergency room bills, when it could have been handled and properly diagnosed the first time with a simple urine test.    To top it off, my boyfriend also expressed to him that for some time he has been having a lot of anxiety and stress.  It has gotten so bad that he has had multiple panic attacks at work.  It took me a long time and much support to finally convince him to talk about it with a doctor, because it is okay for men to also have these issues.  Dr. Dicke more or less told him to suck it up and try to not have anxiety and sent him on his way.  Yet, he wrote me a script a few days earlier.  I am absolutely shocked at the care he received and will not be returning.
1 Dr Yudez is great. The fact that in over a year they haven't gotten a single script yet means you should choose another Dr. Sucks, because he is a caring, intelligent doctor. Snotty little office staff with NO interest in providing good customer service really bites the big one.
3 I was recommended to Dr. Bauer by a friend.  The first time I called to get in, I was seen by Dr. Davey because I couldn't get in with Dr. Bauer until the following week.  He told me I had pink eye and gave me antibiotic drops that made my eye feel worse.  As soon as I stopped taking them, my eye felt better.  It must have just been allergies, so kind of a waste.  I recently made an appointment with Dr. Bauer, and this time they were able to get me in within a couple of days!  I didn't have to wait too long, but I thought it was strange when she came in and said 'it's been a long time since I've seen you!'.  I was like, 'uh, I've never seen you.'  Nonetheless, she seemed pretty nice and concerned about my symptoms.  I was having some weird symptoms, which were difficult to diagnose, so she told me that I needed to get ultrasounds and also they'd like to do some blood work.  She told me to go to the waiting area and someone would come get me.  When the gal came to get me, I was trying to chat with her but she seemed like she wanted nothing to do with me and pretty much ignored me.  I didn't like that, considering she was sticking a needle in me (and who likes that??).  After that, she told me I could go, and was left standing there confused.  I thought I needed to get an ultrasound?  Was there paperwork I needed?  Would they tell me where to call?  I waited another 5 minutes to find someone at the front desk and was finally given a paper to bring with me, along with the info for the ultrasound.  I thought that it was strange that no one cared to tell me what I needed to do.  A few days after my ultrasounds, I received a call from the office saying that they received the ultrasounds as well as the results of my blood work.  The blood work all came back fine and there was nothing wrong there, but she wanted me to come back in to discuss the results of my ultrasounds.  Uhhhh... I called right away, totally freaked out about what the results were!  I had to wait two days to get in to see her, and I had nightmares.  It was not fun.  I go to my appointment, and I have to wait 45 minutes before she ever comes in to see me (and I had gone in the middle of my work day!), and what she wanted to 'discuss' with me was................................................ nothing.  The ultrasounds were all  normal and everything looked fine and dandy.  What?!  Why did I have to come in for that???  So I can pay another office visit fee?  I was really disappointed, and really late getting back to the office.  She recommended I go see another doctor and let her know how it goes.  I feel confused and not 100% sure if I'd go back to this doctor :(
5 Dr Bob is the best!  Super Friendly and easy going!  He is knowledgable and understanding.  He talks and doesn't rush you out the door!  VERY recommended.
5 I love dr. Agniezka Chrostowski, she really cares for her patients, she is professional and kind at the same time.
5 After some shoulder and neck issues that left with some neck motion issues, I needed to find myself a physiotherapist.  As I was speaking with group of friends on two seperate occasion, two different people recommended I come to Cornerstone Physiotherapy at 2 Carlton.  One of them recommended me Cedric Quach.  Well the folks at Cornerstone were very friendly and approachable.  Cedric was very informative, friendly and cared about my progress. When I did not understand something he would take the time to explain it to me.  He's also made himself reachable any time if I was in any more pain during my time with him and after I was rehabilitated.  I'm even considering using other services her at Cornerstone because of the service I've received.  And Gods forbid, I hurt myself again, I will not hesitate coming back to Cornerstone for my rehabilitation.
5 I'm am so glad I discovered FYZICAL. My health has changed so much since I started coming, I'm blessed to be as active as ever, with a huge reduction in migraines and flexibility like I've never had before. Do yourself a favor and call these amazing people when you are in need, they are friendly, compassionate and incredibly skilled.
5 Dr. Mendelson have be my doctor for 4 yrs now. I check in with him every 6 to 8 months. I updates him with my meds etc. I have recently downloaded the MyChart Novant App. It's a life saver. I used to get frustrated with the staffs. I understand what some of the previous Yelpers said when you called the office, a lady or a man would answer and automatically ask you to hold. They're not very pleasant on the phone.  myChary App lets me schedule my appts with Dr. Mendelson whenever I can fit it in. No body will put me on hold. I can send an email to my Doc. And either him or Nurse Kimberly will get back to me right away. If I need to ask questions re: my meds or concerns about my tests results. I feel like they are there via emails. My dealing with the front desk are now slim to none. And my emails are alway get return within 2 hrs or less. Dr. Mendelson and Nurse Kimberly alway remember my chart and they never make me feel like I'm a no#. So as long as I don't have to deal with the office staffs to much, and use my app. Dr. Mendelson will be my doctor!
1 No stars given! I took my friend here and we ended up waiting over 4 hours for her to see a doctor!!! They totally dismissed her, didn't even give her a urine test or anything else she asked for- and the doctor was completely rude to her...Dr. Praveen Saran. And he touched her in a very sensitive spot...with no gloves on!!!! What?!  Would NEVER come back here or recommend it to anyone!
4 I was in serious pain last year from three vertebrae pushing on my sciatic nerve.  I have a high pain tolerance but this episode was unbelievably bad.  My regular doctor recommended Dr. Mohajer and arranged for me to be seen right away.  Thank goodness!  After reviewing my history and looking at my MRI, he suggested the epidural shots and asked when I would be interested in getting the procedure.  When I said, "Tomorrow!" he agreed and fit me in the schedule.  With that procedure, and a follow-up two weeks later, I have been functioning and living my life normally. I have a chronic problem and pain does recur, but each time, Dr. M takes care of my issues.
5 The doctors and staff at De Rosa Medical are awesome! I came to their office at the lowest part of my life, and they helped me pull myself together. The doctors  listened to me, and they believed me when I said I felt awful.  I had a pituitary tumor that 12 other doctors had missed, and thanks to Dr. Mary Montes, this tumor was identified. I was able to have the growth removed by a specialist, and all necessary hormones replaced. I can't express my gratitude enough. I highly recommend this practice to anyone who has hormonal imbalance. They gave me my life back.  :)
1 This was the worst medical experience of my 6 decades of life. Dr, staff & all departments including billing office all very unprofessional. Please do yourself a favor and forget this place & keep looking!
5 After a series of injuries, as well as structural issues and arthritis in my spine, I knew it was time to go back into physical therapy. I asked friends who they would recommend, and most were so far. I called Spooner as I'd been to them before and had a good experience. I talked to the front desk and told them my issues. They recommended Jacob, who is also the manager of that location. Can I tell you how awesome this guy is? He is one of the smartest, most hard-working people I've met, and I'm lucky enough to have him doing physical therapy on me. This guy knows anatomy, and pulls out all the stops to ensure that I receive the absolute best experience every single time. All of the PTs here seem very professional, personable, and very tuned into helping their patients heal. Since going to him, I have improved significantly, and pain is considerably less. How many times do you go somewhere and just trust that they know what they're doing? That has been my experience with Spooner at Desert Ridge. If you live in the area, this should be your first stop for PT.
1 It's hard to find a good nursing home. This is a bad nursing home. Most Life Care facilities are only about profits and numbers. They only want Medicare and will overcharge your Medicare for every cent. Most staff here are foreign and just want to make American money. It's understaffed and very sad how human beings are treated here, to die. No one cares if you are in pain or even die here, they just fill out the right paperwork stating they did everything properly. They get good ratings because the management are like snakes and know how to cover things up.  I'm hoping in the near future nursing homes are exposed or reformed. MiCasa will be one of the first to go out of business.
5 I have seen three different doctors at this office and each one has been fabulous!  Dr. Francyk is amazing, intuitive and really takes the time to listen to your complaints.  I really appreciated how much time he took with me.  I've had doctors that took a rushed 5 minuted to "listen" to my concerns and then just wrote me a script and sent me on my way.  Dr. Francyk was different.  He looked me in the eye when I spoke to him and I knew he was really hearing me.  He spent quite a bit of time explaining possible treatment options and I finally feel like I have a doctor that cares and knows what he's doing!!!  I've seen a lot of complaints about the admin fee of $49/year....but if I need to pay a small fee to have a great doctor and staff on my side, I'm okay with that.  I know a bit about health insurance and primary care doctors really struggle to stay afloat.  No wonder most of them treat their practice like a factory, churning out patients every five minutes.  If the stupid admin fee helps give me more time with my doctor, I'm all for it!  Thank you Dr. Francyk for all your help!
1 My daughter and I both started having symptoms of MS and Fibromyalgia. Each time we have gone, we have both had different Dr's, which makes it nearly impossible to get anywhere. If you are referred anywhere, it is to a place in the same building. One of the Dr's in Neurology is a joke but since my daughter has seen him, they will not let her see another Dr there.  Half the time the staff doesnt send out the referrals and we find ourselves having to keep on their butts to make sure they do their own jobs. This place seriously is a joke. Please, go anywhere else.
4 Two weeks ago I noticed via Martin Lewis's MSE website that anyone can trial a fitness centre near to them. So set about trying to locate one within the city that would suit.   Finally landing on one that looked like it might do what it says on the tin I opted for Nuffield Health. As I never knew there was a sports centre this far west in town and it was in my bus route, naturally it was the best choice.  I hadn't officially started working out this year, as running up and down stairs at work doesn't really count, I jumped at the chance not only get back to the gym, but also to review what a session at Nuffield Health is like?  Time spent in reception upon arrival was definitely shorter than at my last keep fit place a few years ago at Virgin. So in one way this gives you less time sitting about discussing the unique selling points of the centre, filling out paperwork and getting to know them, when sometimes all you want is to feel the burn.  It has a 12 point MOT that recommends you don't proceed with if you have eaten before or done any form of exercise, so I'll have to book that for another week; and it all sounds quite rigorous?  The facilities and layout are great not to squished like my local gym in Tranent, but  good enough for constant turnover in the two hours I was there. All the equipment worked, also there just the right amount of people in each of the two large workout rooms located at the top of the stairs to not make me wait at all, and keep the sweat on so's not cool down much.  1/2 day for some of the classes at weekends so didn't see what they were like. The quiet pool on arrival was fully stocked when the now burnt out shell of mine was in need if some h2O relief, so opted out of this; deciding instead to try out the food facilities.  Within 5 minutes I was enjoying a Berry Smoothy, Cajan Chicken Wrap and Coffee(approx. £10). The Smoothy was icy cool and slightly tart, coffee was Costa type, watery and warm. The chicken wrap was my second choice as they did not make any pasta chicken, which I prefer after a workout) but mild spicy it came with a green and mixed pepper salad, complimented with a nicely balanced vinegar type dressing(so many places miss this when leaves are shouting out for it)!  My only gripe is with the amount of grease that emerged from the wrap on trying to pick it up, so had to use the cutlery. Now it was not that significant greasy disaster as to merit leaving some evidence for Mulder and Scully, but less is surely better, especially due to location.  The £50/m may put some off especially since central gyms charge less than half of this, but I did see some signage within that did prompt at £25/m which for me would be better for my wallet.  Upper body workout(tick), 2k run(tick), 12 point MOT(to be booked), will "I be back"...Taking just over an hour from East Lothian in the direction of the Corn Exchange, wasn't too far out of the way, and only requires one mode of transport to get here? Also it has parking, gel in the showers incase you forgot to pack some and free wifi, just ask for the password at reception. I give it 4/5 stars for all mentioned above; possibly 5 when they add the revamped Sauna, coming soon.
5 I have suffered from long term low back pain. I have been to several chiropractors previously although they only gave me short term relief. Dr Sams was extremely thorough with his exam and and was very knowledgeable when he explained exactly what was causing my pain. After only a couple treatments using adjustments, active release technique, and home exercises has helped me stay pain free. Thank you Dr. Sams
5 I went to see Dr J. Webber after a terrible accident and although he was very busy he squeezed me in for an appointment right away. I had always been reluctant to  go see a chiropractor in the past, mostly because I never got any positive results. After a friend insisted that I go to Desert Chiropractic immediately after my accident, my opinion is now changed forever. Dr Webber really knows what he is doing, he takes the whole body into account rather than just the back. The pain started going down right away and with each treatment I noticed considerable improvements. Dr Webber is gentle, thorough, and understanding. He combines his exceptional skill, intuitive talent, vast knowledge, and incredible attentiveness to really treat the problems and pains. His entire staff is incredibly kind and friendly, and very accommodating; they've always made me feel as if I was going to see some friends and not a Doctor's office. I wholeheartedly recommend Dr J. Webber and Desert Chiropractic to anyone with pain and physical complaints. He has produced real results and I will continue to see them to maintain my well-being and pain-free life.
5 For any locals or visitors to the area I would thoroughly recommend you book Brent for a massage.    Super professional and very passionate about what he does, Brent made me feel at ease with the initial consultation. The massage itself was one of the best I have ever had and was a great way to start my break in Las Vegas. I came away extremely relaxed and free of tension.  I will 100% book again.  Thank you Brent and see you again soon!
2 Doctor is nice but the staff is sooo bad. They don't return calls, don't reply to emails. Just poorly run overall.
1 Owner cut my hair.  When she was done, I looked like Moe from the 3 stooges.  I didn't want to hurt her feelings, so I called, talked to another hair dresser, and asked if someone OTHER than Carol could fix this horrible cut.  I was told, no, Carol would have to do it.  I asked if I could have a refund so I could go elsewhere and get it fixed.  I was told No.  My mother also had a horrible experience when she went to Carol's daughter for a high-light and color.  Instead of the smooth streaks other salon's create, my mother had patches of color all over her head, like the old "Frosting" techniques used in the 70's.  (ugly then, and even uglier now).  The other hair dressers seem to be fine.  Not sure why the owner, and her daughter would be the two people with the worst skills, but that seems to be the case.  Sorry.  Not trying to be mean. Just telling the truth.
5 It took as 2.5 months to get an appointment but every childrens therapy we called that took our insurance had the same wait time. There must be more children needing therapy then there are therapist.   We saw Ana for our first day evaluation with my 9 month old. He is typically grouchy with new people but he warmed up to Ana right away and let her maneuver him without any fuss. My husband and I really like the way she held him and positioned our baby.   They have a ton of toys- toys my baby loved but I cant find anywhere!- to help work with them. The rooms have floor mats in which my baby could sit up on without touching the floor. And after our session she was sanitizing everything my baby touched so it feels good to know my baby will encounter less germs if toys and such are wiped down between patients.   They do have a strict attendance policy but I can understand that. They are very busy and have a wait list 2 months long just to get in the door. Its very rude to cancel last minute or not show up at all. Other families could easily be booked in if they have enough advance notice. To Bunny G who said their policy sucks, it only sucks for people like yourself who cant be bothered to show up when scheduled. Grow up and be a responsible adult and it wont be a problem.
5 I do not get why negative comments, i have been going to Dr. Mohajer for over a year now. I am satisfied with his work!  I have had many procedures on my back and neck from him and he is better than a couple of other places I went to. As for his office help they have always been very friendly and nice every time I have been there.  There is procedures and guidelines they have to follow today from Insurance to laws. Most of the time he is booked 2 weeks out and that is the soonest they can get you in unless there is a cancellation. One a appointment is cancelled most ins. companies have a deadline on their referrals and they have to be resubmitted, He is the professional and has the experience to know what procedure  you may benefit from the most. Not all procedures you will benefit from. Sometimes the procedure may not last a long time but  this is all the process before you may have to go for surgery or just to see what works best for you! It is all temporary, Pain Management is just that, to help you manage whatever pain you maybe having. I totally trust this Dr.! And I think he is awesome!! Yesterday I had a procedure on my back done by him, The  wait was not too long and everything went great!   I highly recommend him if you want a good Dr. No problems or issues at all!!
4 I've been in rehab for two weeks and as outpatient for over a month now The staff are amazing , professional and helpful. The place is clean and the garden is beautiful  I found the parking to be over priced
2 We just moved to Vegas a few months ago from LA and this was my first attempt at finding a good doctor.  I'm giving Forte Family Practice 2 stars because I've seen Dr. Purdy twice and feel she is a great doctor that cares about her patients.  The nurses and staff that I've met in the doctors office are great also.    I'm not happy with this office for 2 reasons:  1. They are extremely rude on the phone.  I called the office to confirm my appointment and once the representative gave me the date and time he hung up the phone abruptly even after I said thank you.  I spoke to several staff members when I was trying to refill my prescription and it took them a whole week to get back to me.  No one called me back after leaving several messages.  Once I finally spoke to a nurse she was rude and also hung up abruptly.  I was told by one of the nurses in the office that they have a call center.  That should not be an excuse since they should be trained to handle any type of call no matter how busy it is.  2. They do not refill prescriptions automatically and cannot call or fax prescriptions directly to your pharmacy.  This is a surprise to me since it's 2014 and my doctors in LA have been doing this for years.  I understand that they want you to see a doctor first before approving a prescription.   If it has been an ongoing prescription they should not have an issue at least confirming 1 months worth of medicine until an appointment can be made.  I don't believe the administrative staff sees the importance of treating their patients with respect.  It doesn't matter if they have a call center.  The call center should be trained to be professionals and show they are part of a medical office that cares about people.
1 I've read these reviews about Dr. Bescak & I couldn't disagree more with the negative reviews.  He is the ONLY positive force in this clinic.  He is the most empathetic, concerned, pro-active Doctor that I have met in a long time.  I'm a retired nurse, medical office technician & can tell you that the problem is NOT Dr. Bescak, it's the non-concerned office staff, who don't return calls, get prescriptions filled prudently greet you properly &'have no desire to help a patient in need.
3 Waited one hour to get in, and then asked to reschedule. The receptionist was rude and said the doctor could now see me. They put me in a back room, where I proceeded to wait another hour. I rescheduled and left. I already paid .if they are running Late they should say so.  Absolutely love Dr. Eye, but would like it if I was not lied to about how long the visit will take
1 Its been 2 and a half hours since my appointment time and I still wasn't seen. I will be really frustrated if I am late work because of this.
1 I had been a patient of Dr. Bradley for over 15 years, however my most recent experience with her and her employee, Anna, was so unsatisfactory that I will not be going back to her, nor will I be recommending any future clientele her way.  I called six months ago (September 2015) to get an inhaler prescription temporarily renewed (my prescription had expired by three days) for my asthma.  When I explained this to Anna, she refused to assist me, stating that they would not be able to refill my prescription until I came in and visited (which in retrospect, I can understand).  However when I tried to make an appointment the next available one wasn't for several weeks.  I ended up having to go to a minute clinic to refill because they gave me no other option and I couldn't be without my inhaler for that length of time.  I experienced another unpleasant encounter with Anna when I called their office yesterday to try and schedule a women's exam.  I asked if I could also get my inhaler prescription renewed in the same visit.  Anna was very curt in denying my request, stating that I would need to schedule a separate appointment to take care of this.  I asked if I could block out additional time/appointment slots to take care of everything in the same visit and she refused to find another solution to accommodate me.  When I tried reaching out to Dr. Bradley about this, she sent me messages via their portal because she refused to have a conversation with me via telephone.  My entire family and I had been seeing Dr. Bradley since I was a teenager, however after this unfortunate series of events, I no longer wish to maintain a relationship with her or her office.  She has proven to me that she is more interested in making money off of her patients rather than accommodating them/their schedules, that she is unconcerned about maintaining longstanding relationships with patients or their loyalty, and that she is unwilling to resolve poor customer service experiences in a tactful, resolute manner.  I would not recommend Dr. Bradley to anyone now and hope that she doesn't treat her other patients the way her and Anna had treated me.
4 I can always get an appt very quickly and it is convenient that they have so many on site services but of you have labs done, prepare to wait 2 weeks for results.
4 Great staff....very knowledgeable and approachable.  PLUS I got results....I was never a big believer in PT, but I am now!  Next I have to try the training sessions!
5 Dr . Joy Wolfe has been my primary doctor since I moved to Arizona in 1989. She has been the best Doctor ever.  I have seen others in her office and her days off but I will never find another more personable and better physician. Saddens me that anyone would ever say one bad word about this fantastic woman.
5 Answer all questions thoroughly and are able to fit me in same day when needed. Very friendly and knowledgeable!
4 I had a great experience with Dr. Martin and her nurse. They were both extremely nice and thorough. Dr. Martin made sure I completely understood what she was telling me and she had so much compassion. The office staff did seem a bit disorganized as they were going to send me off without my prescription. I don't think I would trust them to call it in. That's the only reason they didn't get 5 stars. Overall I was pleasantly satisfied.
5 I first came to Dr. Steve two years ago after I had fallen on my tail bone and was in tremendous pain.  After 3 adjustments, the pain was gone.  After a few more adjustments, my posture was significantly better.  I finished treatment, but then recently returned because I was having daily dizzy spells that were lasting for several hours.  After 4 adjustments, the dizzy spells went away...and it was a lot more affordable than going to an MD and having expensive lab tests done!
5 I have been having trouble looking for a doctor that takes new patients for the past year. Called this office and they were able to schedule an appointment the same week. They were very flexible and the doctor I seen was very understanding and listened and answered all the questions I needed answers for. I guess I found my new primary care doctor! :)
5 I have been a patient at AHC for several years and through multiple weekend warrior injuries, including a car accident.   I had been to several other chiropractors and physical therapists in the past, but by far the staff here is the best and I feel like they actually care about me and how I feel.   Their new office is beautiful and the staff is always friendly.   I get to see everyone I need in the same office so it's very convenient for me.  There are both medical doctors,  physical therapists and chiropractic treatment there.  Also they were all in my insurance network.
2 I updated it to two stars only because my issue was finally resolved by calling the Patient Advocate for Core Institute.  Jason was very helpful and understanding and within 2 weeks he got them to relent and give up on billing me where a billing was not warranted.  It is unfortunate that the Central Billing Department NEVER ONCE directed me there out of all the people I talked to they just kept insisting that it was a "valid billing".  Thank heavens for Yelp or I would still be fighting this and they would have put it against my credit.
2 Require 2 appointments instead of 1 for a new patient annual physical- this way they get to bill more.  Who wants to take off work and sit in a waiting room twice for the same purpose!  I know it takes more time to process new patients, but plenty of other practices do it all in one appointment (and one billing)- makes me wonder what other creative billing and extra appointment schemes they have.  Might be great if you are sick and need seen now, but for someone healthy, look elsewhere.
1 BEWARE!   Just a note to stay clear of this place when being upsold on added services.  They will tell you it's not out of pocket, and insurance will be billed, and then bill you months later in FULL.  Almost a bait & switch tactic in my opinion, since patients TRUST doctors and will sign what is needed prior to treatment.  This place abuses that trust - BEWARE!!
1 The worst customer service for billing issues I have ever encountered. I apparently spoke to the manager of financial services / billing about a insurance co-pay problem and she was extremely disrespectful and condescending. As a healthcare professional in Las Vegas who works in the Sunrise Emergency Department, I have never encountered a more short tempered person over the phone! Decent human respect and customer care is a must in health care even when dealing with financial logistics. They seriously need to reconsider their staff and more importantly their leadership.   Please do yourself a favor and reconsider this location as your primary care!!
5 The day after hiking through Red Rock as a tourist I realized that I hurt myself. I thought I could live through the lower back pain and stiffness until around 4:15 on a Friday evening, right before the holiday, when I got the wake up call. The stiffness turned to inability to move and extreme pain, so I looked to trusty Yelp for an emergency solution. Dr. Badger's office was coming up as open until 6pm, so I called to beg for an appointment - I think they could hear the pain in my voice, because they ended up making room for me in the schedule and staying almost an hour late to accommodate me. I wish I lived here, because after my appointment I wanted to move the entire office to LA so I can make regular appointments. As we suspected, Dr. Badger wanted to take a quick x-ray to confirm his initial findings. I was so out of place I'm surprised that after my adjustment the stiffness had dissipated to a bearable level, although the pain is still about an 8/10. I have a follow up appt. next week where ONCE AGAIN Dr. Badger has fit me into his already booked schedule! Hopefully with his guidance and the second appointment, I'll be in a much better place next week.
1 They used a stand lamp to check if I had a sore throat. Also walk ins will wait the full 3-4 hours. It is demoralizing and insulting. Simple fact, dont go here. They want to do every test just to see if you have strep. why do I need a prostate exam for that in 2 weeks?
5 These people are incredible and today was only my second meeting with them.  The evaluation was so thorough and then scheduling took over.  Tracy is so patient and wonderful!  And then today was his first therapy and he came out laughing and smiling and jumping!  He was so happy to be there.  I have to say that I live 30 miles away, but I will continue to travel 2x a week for such excellent care for my son and my family!  I even got to nearby park recommendations for ideas to keep my two other kids happy during his hour long session.  Wow- cannot say enough! The facility is also out of this world beautiful!  A kid's dream!
1 A good experience starts with the front desk staff,  discrimination and racism describe my experience at this place today.
5 My review was rejected by yelp, weird.  I love this place and all it's employees! ! I tell everyone i know about mandy. If you have any issues come and see them!
4 Great (if going to a Dr can ever be considered great) clinic not far from home. Can't complain.  Sometimes the walk-in clinic can get busy, but its a walk-in clinic. You will wait a heck of alot longer if you go to the hospital.  Had pleasent experiences with both my kids. Friendly Drs who were quite and understood the challenges of having a sick kid on your lap waiting.  Everytime I have been its a pretty quick in and out. Short and sweet. If that is what you are looking for, check it out.   If you are the type to come to the Dr and want to chat about the weather and how the teller at the bank looked at you funny, you might want to move along. They run a well-oiled machine here.
2 During my initial visit I felt that the physical therapist did give me a thorough evaluation and explained what she thought was going on and the goals of the therapy. And I did appreciate that I always worked with a physical therapist and wasn't passed off to a physical therapy assistant after my initial appointment.   However, after the first appointment, there was overlap with other patients (I'd arrive and she was finishing with the last patient, so she'd leave that patient to get me started.. and then I would still be there and her next patient would arrive, and she'd leave me there for a bit to get that patient started). Sometimes the interruptions were brief, other times not, depending on what was going on with the patient.  Frequently, the physical therapists would congregate while watching their patients do their exercises and converse/complain about how many patients that had to see in a day or in a week. And I think they were feeling overworked. And like other reviewers said, it was like a conveyor belt.  I had been going there for a few weeks and making good progress but was nowhere near healed, and out of the blue my physical therapist announced it was my last day, even though I had plenty of visits left through my insurance company. They must cut people off at a certain number of weeks, either to appease the insurance companies or to not get on the radar of the insurance companies.   I would not go there again.
5 Great place!! Dr. Steve is AWESOME and the ladies in the front were very friendly and polite!!
1 The worst pain doctors I have ever been to. I  highly don't recommend them. Should have never went back after the first time. Both doctors didn't give a fuck like I was wasting their time being their. And if they dont like you, you will definitely get treated like it and find away to get rid of you.....So would definitely not go to this place.
1 If you want to be stocked by creepy men here when you work out than don't go here. Horrible environment & full of scammers that took my money once I quit my membership. I'm so happy I found an amazing gym now moving on to better things...
5 Dr. Steve does amazing work.  Anytime my back hurts or issues with my headaches he always has the answers to fix them.  Even little minor adjustments that he does makes a big difference.  Since he started adjusting me I haven't had  a serious migraine and I have been having them for over 15 years.  Thanks Dr. Steve you're awesome.
5 Renaissance Medical has made the experience so exceptional, that I had to write a review to congratulate them on doing everything right!  I have been seeing the doctors and PA at this practice for over two years, and both my wife and I have always had great experience.    From scheduling the appointment, to post-visit follow up everyone we interact with is extremely professional, pleasant and very helpful.  I also appreciate the efficient workflow.  Their patient portal is very useful and easy to use.  Also, I love the fact that I don't need to fill out a million form every time I come to the office. It is all on the portal.  Most important, I NEVER had to wait more than 5 minutes on a scheduled appointment.    Finally, most impressive, the doctors and PA's NEVER rush the appointments.  They spend as much time as needed, and actually talk to you not at you, and ask you how you are doing.  It is almost like visiting a small-town doctor's practice that has all the modern, state-of-the art amenities and services.    Great Job Renaissance!
5 The staff at American Physical Medicine is great. I came there after going to my primary doctor and her telling me to just take pain meds for my headaches.  When I came here the staff was very helpful to me by trying to solve my problem and not just mask it with pain meds.  My headaches have gotten much better since I started therapy and getting adjusted each visit.
5 Felix is definitely the best in the business.  He has helped me with several injuries I had. He's very professional and has helped me become a better version of myself. His prices are very reasonable and he is unlike some people in the business who charge lots of money with no real results or knowledge.
2 The physical therapy staff is professional and attentive. At times the therapy room was too crowded and the staff was stretched pretty thin. The billing department is a nightmare and is the main reason for the low rating. I have been waiting for months for them to submit the bills to my carrier and this is causing a delay in the closing of a claim. I have contacted the billing office 4 times in the last two weeks and was assured it would be resolved. My next step is to go down to the office in person and collect the bills myself so they can be submitted. Not worth the hassle. Don't waste your time and energy on this place. There are plenty of other options out there.
5 I visited this particular location because of the reviews I read online in which everyone seemed pleased. The clerk at the front desk was prompt and friendly; likewise, the wait time was extremely short. I was assisted by Stephanie and Vanessa; both of them were extremely friendly, knowledgeable, and made me feel comfortable. I did not feel rushed and both ladies answered all of my questions. I have never experienced such great and caring staff before. Though this location is a further drive than many others, I will continue to visit here because I actually felt taken care of.
5 1 1/2 years ago, I learned that without medical treatment, within 3 months, I would have been in a diabetic coma and likely have died.  After a diabetes diagnosis with an A1C above 14.0 and blood glucose over 350, I knew proper nutrition and medication were both in order.  To me this was a war.  Diabetes on one side and me on the other side.  Drastic measures were in order. Tonya, the nutritionist, is spectacular.  Tonya was able to explain the importance of proper nutrition and offered a list of foods that were diabetic friendly. She initially charted a very strict diet .  Due to the severity of my condition, I stuck very strictly to the diet she suggested.  Results:  my A1C came down to 5.8 within 6 months.  I have been stable ever since.  In short, Tonya saved my life and I don't say that lightly. While most people rely on their doctor and medication, a very important and overlooked component is diet and nutrition.   My ongoing stability is due to two key components:  the medication Dr. Frye prescribed and the diet Tonya suggested. As of this point, my results have been very close to normal for both glucose and A1C, thanks to the commitment I received from both Dr. Frye and Tonya.  Having the right team on the health battlefield with you makes for a successful outcome.  I made the right choice and the proof is in the results.  Thank you Tanya and Dr. Frye!   Tonya is a hidden gem at this office. Ask for her and let her chart your nutritional course to feeling better.  She also certifies pilots, so you know she knows her stuff!
2 Jolli was pleasant and the facilities are clean,welcoming, relaxing, and soothing. This was my first time trying the closed system. Now I know that I prefer the open system. It's where the technician instructs you on the insertion, massages tummy lightly, and massages your feet and leaves. In this closed system, a fat tune is inserted by Jolli., and she regulates the water pressure. Although I arrived 15 mins earlier than instructed, I felt rushed.  She talked the entire time. I was led to sign up for more sessions. I intended to do more if I liked this type of therapy. In her haste to get her moved up appointment in, I was not even offered water.
2 I was referred to the Mayo Clinic for some digestive issues I was having.  They set me up here to start with a primary and I happened to see Dr. Engle.  My first visit with him was good, I felt like he cared about my problems and getting to the root of the cause. So he sends me off to the clinic for a barrage of tests (which took place over the course of 6 months or so).   All in all, the tests came back with no red flags, they recommended some dietary changes. So after all was said and done I went back to Dr. Engle has he was supposed to now be my primary physician.  This visit did not go well.  He shrugged me off like I was an annoyance, seemed like he had no time for me and basically left me with a 'not much more I can do for you'.  Not the attitude I need from someone who is supposed to be my go-to guy.  I am a chronic pain/illness sufferer with a lot of issues and I didn't feel comfortable sticking with him for the long run.   Mayo has a certain way of doing things.  You have to go through quite the rigamarole and see a long list of their dr's to get them to actually treat you for anything.  I just need 1 good doctor, and you don't get that at Mayo.  I'm sure the system works for some, but not for me.
5 We have been seeing Dr. Pillai for over 8 years. We could not ask for a more caring, truly dedicated family physician. He is thorough, does not hesitate to give referrals for testing or to see specialists, and in every way has been attentive to our family's medical needs. Selena, and Will have with him as long as we have been patients of his, and they are exceptional in working us into his schedule when necessary. I cannot say enough good things about Dr. Pillai and his staff. We drive sixteen miles round trip to see Dr. Pillai, and would not consider changing doctors.
3 Friendly staff. Professional setup. Ask A LOT of questions. Be sure to check and double check with your insurance to be sure you fully understand what's covered and for how long. The center works with you, but by then it's too late if you've already paid. Yikes! Big investment for only 70% improvement and still in horrible pain. If you become concern at any time SPEAK UP and speak with Dr. Jaeger, the Director. Partially my fault for not speaking up that my adjustments weren't what I had hoped for, not wearing shoe lift 100%, nor did I use the Denner Roll as often as recommended.
1 Contacted business on the 20th of January to set up an appointment for my daughter. Three days later I emailed back all needed paperwork and insurance information.  I contacted them on the 27th and 30th because I haven't heard back, said therapist would call me that day. Called yesterday as one last effort to get appointment. Told me therapist would call me. Worst establishment ever.
5 It is so refreshing to go to a medical facility that genuinely cares about their patients!  From the front office to every doctor, nurse and tech - they are all pleasant, friendly, helpful and show compassion.  Extremely competent and educated doctors that go the extra mile for you. Beyond thankful a friend referred them! Thank you for all you do for your patients, it is truly is a breath of fresh air!
5 I've been dealing with plantar fasciitis (foot pain and inflammation) for a little over six months now. I tried everything to rid myself of this pain and was at my wit's end, and decided to give Dr. Boothe a shot. Boy, am I glad I did! When I initially starting seeing him about two months ago, my pain level was 7/10, and now it's about a 2/10. My pain level has improved significantly and I know it will continue to decrease the more visits I have. He has a vast knowledge of certain conditions, what affects them, and the best ways to treat them. Many doctors are guilty of band-aid fixes and just giving a solution that they think works for everyone, but Dr. Boothe is a progressive, forward thinker, so he won't just give you shots or orthotics and wish you luck; he takes the time to figure out why you're having the pain you are having and how to best fix it for YOU. He has taken the time to break up my scar tissue and work on my soft tissue, get me more flexibility and mobility, and ensured that I understood how to do the stretches he was showing me. He truly listens to what bothers me and why it does, and gives the best solution for it. He's also a very awesome guy who is friendly, so that makes things even better and easier! I would 100% recommend Dr. Boothe to anyone looking for an outstanding chiropractor in the greater Phoenix area!
5 I have been taking my elderly mother to Complete Care for some time now.  I truly love how they treat my mother and I.  My mother who is up there in age, really feels very comfortable in seeing Dr. Hererra and his staff.  They show her respect and compassion.  When I have a medical issue with my mom I call Valerie and she helps facilitate what ever issue I may have in regards to my mom, be it medication, in need to see Dr. Hererra, or any medical condition my mom may be experiencing at the of my call.  Valerie responds in a timely manner, she is the most helpful of all staff (outside of the doctors, of course).  I am so pleased with this facilty that I have recommended other family members to them.  I don't go to Complete care only because I'm already established with my PCP way before I found Complete Care for my mother.
5 Loved my first visit. Everyone friendly and helpful. Doctor made me feel comfortable and no guilt trips. No wait. Set up meds and screenings at other locations in a very convenient way.
5 Dr. Warren worked some magic on my back.  I have had chronic back issues for years.  I called Healthsmart out of desperation because I needed an appointment that same day due to some accute pain and I was pleasantly surprised with the results.  After 3 adjustments I felt 50% better and after 5 I was back to normal. Yay!  I am sure this will not be a permanent fix but I am so relieved to have a trusted place to go when things get out of whack again.
5 I was having pain and soreness in my hip due to sitting at a desk too much. It had been going on for well over a year before I started seeing Kim Kelley at Jefferson Therapy. After a few sessions and a couple months of exercises and stretches at home, my hip has loosened up dramatically and no longer hurts periodically. Great experience!
2 I don't understand why on their website it clearly states under "consultation" the following: "...you will have a consultation with Dr. Derek Chow to discuss your health-related problems, concerns, and potential treatment options. This initial visit is designed for Dr. Derek Chow to learn more about you, your condition, and  expectations to determine how chiropractic care can meet your goals."  To my surprise they simply just told me Dr. Chow only meets the patients if your injury is sports related. Really?!  I felt that this is misleading because the number one reason I gave this place a try was because I thought I was going to be assessed by the doctor himself.   Secondly, the straw that broke the camel's back was their scheduling.  I was there on a Friday and I booked a second visit for the following Friday. My injury is due to postpartum baby care pains and so I had to make alternative arrangements for a babysitter to babysit my newborn in order to attend my next session.  They called me 2 days before saying they aren't able to see me anymore Friday because there was a scheduling error.  This had caused me $45 to cancel with my babysitting service less than 3 days in advance.    Friday comes, receptionist called me but I missed their call and she left me a voicemail at 5:30pm asking if I was still going to go in for my 5pm appointment?!?  I don't get it, why call to ask me that when you cancelled?  I would not recommend this business.
1 I made an appointment based on a family member's recommendation to see Dr. Suzanne Bennett.  However, I never got past the front office receptionist (I can't remember her name but she was a little older, maybe late 40's/early 50's and had shoulder length reddish/orange-ish hair) and office manager who both treated me in a rude, condescending and extremely unprofessional manner.  It felt like the receptionist was grasping at straws when I made the appointment asking me for another reason they could put down that I wanted to be seen even though I told her I was very a healthy individual and just needed a women's well exam since it has been 5 years since I had my last child and had one.  Apparently it's office policy that they don't do well exams for adults on the first visit, but require a separate initial visit to take medical history.  I said I didn't want to pay out of pocket for an extra visit just to meet the doctor.  However, I thought it had been cleared up with Darlene (office manager) before I came in that both the initial exam they insisted on and the well exam I asked for would be covered by insurance as preventative.  But when I got there for my appointment they wanted to charge me out of pocket for a diagnostic/sick visit and spoke to me in a condescending tone whenever I asked questions trying to clear up the misunderstanding. So I got my insurance on the phone and the agent said she'd never heard of an office requiring you to be seen before you can be seen and that she would need to talk with Darlene in a three way call to see how it would be billed.  Darlene told the insurance agent that they needed an extra initial visit to get my history, etc and then they would know what the diagnosis and treatment would be.  (Huh?)  The agent asked if there would be a medical diagnosis on the bill and Darlene answered yes.  I spoke up and told Darlene I didn't understand how she could already know there would be a medical diagnosis before the doctor had seen me since I only wanted to come in for a well exam?  Darlene said she was busy and had to go and hung up.  The receptionist (Chrissy? Brittany?) who I was standing next to at the counter answered the question I had posed to Darlene by repeating in a condescending tone, "WE DON'T DO WELL EXAMS ON THE FIRST VISIT."  I said, "Yes, you've both repeated that several times today".  And then the receptionist made a rude comment to me and when I said it was rude she replied, "You're rude".  I said, "Wow, I've never been treated like this before.  I'm just trying to sort this out and you just lost this office an entire family."  She said she didn't care and I wasn't going to be seen anyway because my appointment time had passed.    I understand office staff are under pressure when dealing with patients who have questions and concerns but I was flabbergasted at the manner in which I was treated by these two women.  If they had been professional and courteous and answered my concerns in an appropriate manner I might have agreed to pay out of pocket for an initial visit, even though I don't agree with that policy.  It seemed like they were just trying to get more money for more visits.  Why can't you accept my previous medical records or take a medical history at the well exam?  How can you require someone to pay out of pocket for a diagnostic visit they don't want just so you can bill it as a diagnostic visit?  How can you decide there will be a medical diagnosis before you've even seen the patient?  My husband is a professional and if we had office staff that treated patients or potential patients the way I was treated they would be replaced.
1 Front staff is rude! I thought it would be different in person... when I made appointment I almost didn't make it do to the rudeness, but have heard great things about Dr Datta.  If I didn't hurt so much I would hVe left after waiting an hour to even be taken back to my appointment. NOT A GOOD EXPERIENCE HERE.
5 I've suffered from chronic lower back pain for over a decade from an old injury.  In a little over a week I've gone from having my hips being visibly tilted, my foot pointing out, and barely being able to sleep; to almost no pain, standing upright and straight, and sleeping great every night. I'm only halfway brought my treatment and can't wait to see how I feel at the end.    I tried everything short of surgery to fix my problem, but a chiropractor only wants to adjust, physical therapists only want me to stretch and exercise, MDs only want to give me painkillers and muscle relaxers. Dynamic Health uses all of that, with the latest technology and created a plan specific to my problem and my body. They're constantly asking me how I'm feeling, and adjusting the plan.
5 This is a very professional physic practice. Midtown location is excellent and right on TTC.  The space and atmosphere is quiet and serene, enabling both client and physic to focus on the problem at hand.  My physiotherapist is quite young, and has a genuine desire to help.  She has tried several different approaches in order to do so, and is always respectful and kind.  In short, I commend Toronto Physiotherapy to any client as an excellent source of help.
5 After suffering a serious concussion I found Cornerstone Physio therapy and have worked with both Joon and Jocelyn.  I have had serious back and foot issues and tried many physios - and let's face it there are good and bad ones.  I can't say enough good things about Cornerstone.  Joon cured me of my BPPV (vertigo after the fall that caused the concussion) and helped me to be confident back on my feet asap, and actually with better balance than before the fall.  He recommended Jocelyn to help with the whiplash I suffered from the fall.  Jocelyn has magical hands - she knows exactly where to push, pull, stretch, hold to help loosen and heal.  The office staff at both locations are patient and kind.  This practice is professional and caring - I have recommended them to friends and family.
5 I have been going to Dr Milne for about 10 years.  He is a wonderful doctor.  When I first went to him, no other doctor could figure out what to do for me.  I was absolutely miserable and would probably have died by now if i didn't meet him.  Dr Milne is the only Dr that I have ever gone to his office and found binders full of letters and cards thanking him for what a great job he did.  Many of them also believe that he saved their life.  During the time that I have been chatting with other patients I have met many who were sent home to die (by others) or expected to die had they not seen him.  Over time I have begged 3 friends to give him a chance and they decided to stick with their old doctor and not give him a try.  Maybe that was a good choice for them because sometimes you are ready to go.  All 3 are dead now.  So to those reviewers who are used to having insurance pick up the tab, my answer is:  What good will the money do you if you are dead? Costly? If you think paying cash for your doctor costs...Wait until the funereal costs come in!  I have decided to not have a funeral and give the money to Milne.  My money is more well spent on enjoyable living.  During my first visit and before my 2nd visit I saw a 50% improvement in symptoms (in a few days).  I honestly don't remember the charges because I felt like I was about to jump out of my own skin before he treated me and it was totally worth it.  If you are paying $1000 a month for federal health insurance and you are still ill... what is a bad deal financially?  Some treatments that you get here MAY be covered by your healthcare plan.  I will also tell you that the last time I felt like I was getting a straight un-sugar-coated talk from another doctor was in the 1960's.  So if you are looking for a doc who is going to give you some pills and tell you to "lets see in two weeks", this is not your doctor.  If you don't want to hear that you eat the wrong food or need to improve other habits, this is not your dr.  If you want to be fed a bunch of BS about its going to b ok without your efforts, this is not your dr.  If you are not open to considering treatments that will require you do do things that you don't like and stick with him long enough to give the treatment a chance, stick with big pharma medicine.  They will keep you comfortable and feed you BS until they tell you to die in a hospital or never tell you until you are dead.  If you are not going to give it a chance and do what is prescribed don't expect results like pharmaceutical specialists get.  Because the plan for treatment is not to mask your symptoms.  I have found Milne's staff to be very friendly and efficient and helpful... ALWAYS.  Please forgive some of my remarks because i read the 1 star reviews first and their experience is not mine.  Milne has proscribed pharmaceuticals for me and others when needed.  It is that pharmaceuticals are simply not the answer for many things.  If you get that then Milne is a good choice for you.  If you are smart enough or near death enough to realize that what you have been doing is not working and you need to get serious about helping yourself... this is the best doctor for you.  Just my opinion.  But that is the one that I usually go by.
1 Sadly, I have to downgrade Dr. Tang. Yes, the things I said before are true -- she is honest and caring. But neither of those can take the place of competency and thoroughness.   Over a year ago I showed her a huge lesion on my ankle. She glanced at it and said "That's a wart." She didn't get close to it, didn't stare at it, didn't touch it -- just a cursory glance.  I had to choose a new doc when I went on Obamacare and this doc looked at it and sent me to a dermatologist to have it checked. I had it biopsied and today I got the results that it is squamous cell carcinoma. ONE YEAR AFTER Dr. Tang told me it was a wart.  Please, if you have any doubt about anything happening to your body, choose your physician carefully. Unfortunately, as nice as she is, Dr. Tang is simply incompetent.
1 Went here for a bad back and was sorely disappointed. The owner refused to shake my hand and was a complete ass. I would never recommend this place to anyone.
1 Dreadfully slow service. 5 in waiting room. Took over an hour to get called back. Nonsensical waiting.
4 I was referred to this Dr's office by family.  They do get busy but always cater to you.  Dr. Hailstone is very informative and patient.
1 We are from AZ. While on vacation in Colorado my husband had a heart attack. We came back home and he couldn't wait to get back to Sante of Scottsdale. Spent a month there in 2013 after a stroke and we could never say enough positive about his stay. This visit was not positive in ANY way (except for his night nurse Ruby who came on duty well after the chaos was in play). I have been my husband's caregiver for about 10 years but unfortunately had to go to the ER and then to the hospital the day of his admission. My son took him and admitted him but had to leave when his 3 year old became extremely fussy. When my husband called me he was crying and hyperventilating. Had been trying to get assistance and was ignored over an extended period of time. Trying to get pain meds, needed help to get out of his uncomfortable wheelchair and into bed.  My husband had wheeled himself down to the front door waiting for someone to come get him. I was unable to reach our son Son so I had to check myself out of the hospital against the doctors orders (which means I will probably have to pay for my very short stay there and the ambulance ride that got me there) and call a very good friend who came and got me and then we went to pick up my husband at Sante. I should have read these reviews on Yelp from other unsatisfied loved ones before making arrangements. Very sad and disappointed. Hope Sante can be fixed but I am afraid we will never use them again.
5 Dr Gupta is awesome! I love the fact that she sits down and listens to what you have to say and always gives you the chance to voice any issues! She is thorough in what she orders and her office is quick to call back with results! Office is also good about getting you in if you need an appointment! I'm surprised to see no one has written A review on her yet she is awesome! Highly recommend her if you're looking for a PCP! And she always gives you a hug which I like!
5 From the first phone call I made to the office, I was treated with care.  Very friendly, kind, professional and efficient Front Office Staff, Billing Department, Dr. Albert Or, Nurses and Assistants included.  The entire staff has always treated me warmly and with respect.   Having a private conversation about your medical concerns can be uncomfortable and embarrassing no matter how big or small it may be.  My problems may not seem that important compared to other people, however the staff at FDOGV didn't make me feel like I was wasting their time or they were too busy for me.  They always took the time to answer my questions made me feel at ease as they continue to treat me and help me through the process of regaining my health.  The Front Office gets busy at times however the staff is always patient and friendly.   They always say hello and goodbye, acknowledging me and making me feel more comfortable.   I highly recommend FDOGV and I thank them for everything they do everyday to help people like me.
5 I took my adult daughter to see Dr Patel  for the first time today due to many stomach symptoms she has had for at least 6 months.  We were in the process of moving out of state, so we had to wait to have her seen until after the move.  It was so stressful trying to find a good doctor in our new neighborhood!  After reading other Yelpers' opinions of Dr Patel, I was thrilled to find that he was taking new patients!    Dr Patel came in the exam room and within a very few minutes of LOOKING at her, really looking and listening...(amazing!) he suggested several vitamin deficiencies and possible allergies that our previous primary care physicians didn't even mention!!  Blood work was ordered and performed RIGHT there by his staff - we didn't have to go to a lab or anything!  He then came back in, explained his thoughts and said we would get the blood panel results directly via email!!  So, her problems are not solved....YET...but after seeing Dr Patel, I am confident that she will be better soon!  We have found our new family doctor!! Yay!  Thanks YELP! :)
1 If you are looking for an experienced Pediatrician who will do more than asses your child based on basic data look elsewhere. Dr. Shi doesn't support breast feeding. She is a big fan of pushing formula. I was disappointed in both appointments and have found a pediatrician elsewhere.
5 I saw Dr. Anastasi for a general physical, and I couldn't have been happier.  Like most people I dread going to the doctor.  But He made me feel good about it.  His bedside manner is excellent and he listened to all my concerns without judgement.  He really knows his stuff and is very personable.  The staff was friendly and made things easy for me.  Dr. Anastasi was prompt and didn't keep me waiting.  He even gave me tips on where I could save on my Rx.  I have recommended him to my friends and family and I would recommend him to you as well.  I was very impressed with Dr. Anastasi and the whole staff and I hope to see him (just for check ups of course!) for years to come.
5 Checked in to Tempe St Luke's October 23, 2017 for hip replacement surgery, preop care was efficient and caring. Surgery by Dr. Sumko was excellent. The after surgery care was fantastic, very caring and quick response especially from Mary, Amanda (RN) Virginia (CNA) Chelsea (RN) and Bobbi (PT)
5 Over the moon to finally have a wonderful caring doctor locally! It's been a rough 4 yrs after moving here.  I can't say enough about Dr. Docasar she is nice, friendly, informative and most of all listens (really!) hears you and answers all your questions and concerns and never rushes you out ever!  Her assistant is fabulous as well! I wouldn't change doctors for anything! I actually feel cared about with Dr. Docasar... I love that she is paperless as well - love it & love my care!
5 I'm so thankful I relied on Yelp to find Dr. Levins. For the past year, he's been there for me and helped me tremendously. His politeness and knowledge are an absolute blessing. Without question, he's one of the better doctors I've ever seen in my life. Thanks again!
3 The reception staff are really nice and helpful. They speak both English and Spanish really well. The waiting room is really small and clean with lots of magazines. It was really hot though!  The nurse/recptionist was really helpful and even called my insurance company to make sure that everything was squared away.  I was seen back into the room fairly quickly.  The rooms were kind of small, the equipment isn't state of the art but it does the job.  The doc was in to see me quickly and listen to everything I had to say before he asked questions and looked at everything.  He seemed fairly confident and knowledgeable.  Asked me if i wanted a generic brand prescription or brand name.  When I was checking out he came up front and smalled talked me a little and got to know me.  Overall I think I am going to stick with them as my primary care provider.
1 Not a fan of this place. Always feel like I'm getting the run around. They don't do same day appointments if you need to see a doctor, get an ultrasound, and get your ultrasound results. They make you come back another day. I've asked them to call, mail or email me my results and they won't do it. This is a business not a care facility. Save your time and copays! Find another place that's about patient care.
5 This weight loss program does work i would definitely recommend it to everyone!!!!They take any insurance and there are great with there patients on explaining how everything works!!
5 You will not find a better Chiropractor.  I have suffered with neck and back issues the majority of my life.  I have seen many chiropractors and he is the first to have success with not only controlling the pain but working to eliminate it..  While he is a wonderful sports practioner, he is great for all ages and has seen both my 18 month and 3 year old.  I highly reccomend Dr. Boothe!
5 Dr. Z and his staff are Great! I came to Dr. Z with chronic lower back pain. He gave me options of paths of treatment and let me decide what I was comfortable doing. I am always in control of my therapy and educated on what we are doing. Along with his physical therapy team, he's been able to drastically reduce the swelling and calm down the radiating pain in my lower back. I'm extremely thankful for everything that Backfit has done and continues to do for me!
1 I've been trying to get a referral for a specialist from this office from weeks without any success.  Thankfully, its not for a life threatening issue otherwise I'd be in real trouble.  I have called them 6 times in the past 4 weeks and the office keeps saying its in process, but I never get a result.
1 I've been coming here for 2.5 years as my doctor moved here. They are never on time with appointments, I seem to sit upwards of 30-45 before getting into my room than another 10-15 for dr. Not sure why making appointments are needed when they never honor the correct time.
2 Dem frosch kann ich mich nur anschliessen
3 Die Praxis ist sauber und gut gelegen. Ausstattung erscheint mir neu, hygienisch und wertig. Das Personal ist prinzipiell freundlich und kompetent, allerdings gibt es meiner Meinung nach Unterschiede zwischen den Therapeuten, die nicht von der Hand zu weisen sind. Meine Vertretung nahm sich augenscheinlich mehr Zeit und gab mir hilfreichere Hinweise als mein eigentlicher Therapeut.  Was ich als Unding empfinde ist die Tatsache, dass Termine, die nicht wahrgenommen werden können und nicht rechtzeitig abgesagt werden privat übernommen werden müssen. Wenn ich am Wochenende krank werde und am Montag einen Termin nicht wahrnehme, bleibe ich privat auf den Kosten sitzen, obwohl die Behandlung über die Krankenkasse abgerechnet werden. So etwas habe ich noch nie gehört. Werde die Praxis deswegen in Zukunft meiden. Schade.

1 I have been going to this office for a few years, and for some reason I have never thought to review them on yelp. Weird.  Anyway, the front office staff is friendly enough. I can usually get an appointment within a day or 2. I was unique with some of the paperwork I had to provide for my school, and the office was always extremely accomodating with short notice or allowing me to pick up a note without an appointment, or just calling up and explaining what the school needed and they would call me when it was readt, etc etc  I recommend Dr. Whipple. He is super nice. He spends time with you to answer all your questions. And, being a nurse, I find him thorough. There have, also, been a few times where I asked for a certain test to be done, and he will order it.  I, also, like that there are some things done onsite, which is convenient...such as X-rays and ultrasounds.  The negatives for me are they weigh you in the hallways out in front of everyone. And, I just feel like, for a lot of people, this might be something they want to keep private. They, also, close early on Fridays...I think at 3:30p.  Also, the last time I was there I left a class an hour early so I would be on time and arrived at 3:15 for a 3:30 appointment. I did not get called to the exam room until 4:30. Then I waited another 30 minutes for the doctor to actually see me. I didn't end up leaving until 5:30. I had to cancel dinner reservations for 6:30 because of this. And, NO ONE apologized. Totally unacceptable. I was beyond irritated. What was weird is there were only  of us waiting to be seen by various docs...so it wasn't like they were crazy busy.  Lastly, pray you never need your medical records because Jacqueline in that department will do everything in her power to not give them to you. I called on April 1st and faxed my signed request. I got no response for a week, so I called to get a status update. I was told my request was never received even though I had my successful fax confirmation. I refaxed my request on April 22 then called to confirm it was received. I tried explaining that I was working with a deadline from my insurance company, and because my 1st request allegedly wasn't received, now I had even less time. For whatever reason, this passed Jacqueline off. I honestly can't think of another instances where someone was this mean on the phone...seemingly for no reason. It was indicated to me in so many words, that because she could make me wait, she would make me wait. As of May 13...still no records. Thanks, Jacqueline!!
5 I had an 103 degree fever for several days and needed to see a DR ASAP. I am new in  town and have no Primary Care Physician yet, so I tried this Urgent care.  I filled out the basic paperwork at 8AM on a SAT morning. I may have waited 15 minutes overall before being treated.  They took quick action, took vitals, did an immediate X-ray and diagnosed severe Pneumonia. They filled the prescriptions onsite and saved me from another trip and wait at the pharmacy.  I saw immediate relief as my fever broke, and I am on the road to recovery.  I got prompt, caring, and professional advice.    Recommended!
5 While Dr. Doug's (Dr Douglas Cunningham) office isn't really close to where I live, it's good to know that he is one of the most friendly, thorough and cute doctors Ive had. You know its good to have a doc that's cute, makes the trip in even more worth it. Many of his patients are also gay men so he knows what a gay guy needs.. omg, that sounded funny! Let me try again, he knows the special medical needs of gay men such as std screenings (if applicable), check for anal cancer etc..   Dr Doug, thanks for taking such great care of me and the Mr!!
1 I wasn't actually seen by any Doctors at Norterra. I never got past the receptionist Heidi. She was so rude!!!!! When I called to ask if any of the doctors performed womans exams (as they are listed as family medicine I wasn't sure) she literally scoffed and told me of course they did they were doctors. Then every questionI asked I had repeat 3 or four times before she answered it. She just kept saying the same thing over and over again without actually answering my question. So terrible!
4 The price is of course great and the massage was good. I am a little disappointed that they have not commented on the couple of bad reviews they have on Yelp. I feel in this day in age businesses should respond to bad reviews to show they care about their customers. The rooms and the house are beautiful and it has a great location.
5 I previously was employed here for close to 5 years and loved it! I would definitely have any of my loved-ones here should they need rehab. The staff is so unbelievably caring and treat one another like family. The senior management go out of their way to appreciate the employees, know the patients, and continually improve the facility. The facility was newly remodeled when I worked here and was always kept in top condition. The technology for therapy and nursing was always improving and was top-of-the-line! If there were a Healthsouth near where I moved, I'd still be working for this company. I cannot say enough positive comments about this company and facility--as an employee and an advocate for patient care.
5 Dr, Kathy is by far and away, the best GP I've ever had. She has a calling to the medical field, and it shows every day. If you are looking for a family practice doc, you need search no further.   To put it simply: She rocks!
1 I find it very humorous as well that they make an effort to reply- I am assuming only so they try to save face or appear as though they are trying to make things right. Do note that I have attempted to contact them multiple times and have sent private messages in response to their comment with no returned reply. The comment that they want to help is complete BS!!!
1 I'm not one to post bad reviews but this doctor's office has disappointed me on multiple occasions. From not sending my lab work (took 3 attempts to get done),  primary doctor being unavailable, unsupervised children running around, rude evening receptionist, misdiagnose on my treatment, and appointment delays. I've been going here for a few years and was content with the services but recently, this office's quality of customer service has gone down and has forced me reconsider new doctors office. This office has enjoyed taking my money for too long and I believe has committed to taking on too many appointments per day and horrible time management.   However, 95% of the nurses have always been friendly, considerable, and apologized for the long delays.
5 I absolutely love Wonderful Smiles. The front desk ladies are always so cheerful & make you feel welcome. They explain all insurance & out of pocket costs in detail. Dr. Davis is awesome. I highly recommend Wonderful Smiles to make your smile wonderful!
5 My schedule is unpredictable, but they're always able to work me in last minute. I do wish they had Friday hours, though.
5 Great staff who is really friendly and doctors who are kind and caring.  Dr. Ferdowsian took the time to ask about my concern and he was able to help me feel better in no time. Wait time was quick and walk in welcomed.  Highly recommended for all your urgent or family medicine needs.
5 My life has improved so much since becoming a patient of O'Brien Physical Therapy. I was referred to this office by Dr. Brian Shafer (highly recommend!) to deal with a longtime bilateral shoulder impingement.   When I arrived, I could not lift either arm without significant pain (8 out 10). This has interfered with my daily activities for more than a year. I am a nurse and need a full range of motion; I love yoga but found it incredibly difficult to do some of the moves; and just everyday activities were challenging. Each member of this group plays a role in my improvement. Kayla did her best to accommodate my schedule and insurance issues and queries. Patrick set up attainable goals and a plan to reach those goals. Josh was often the enforcer of the plan, challenging me to reach the next level.   This office is kind and personable while challenging. Thank you so much for guiding me to pain-free movement. Namaste  Angie Burr
5 Oh my gosh I was so worried about changing our Dr because our insurance changed. I can tell you aftere going to Dr Kody Smith we didn't miss a beat.  The office staff is good and not to long wait times. Note though dr Smith takes his time explaining things to his patience. He's a very good Dr.  Have to put a shout out ot Cloe in the office too! She's just awesome  she is so helpful! So if you have any doubts about trying this office don't. I just love them and don't plan on going anywhere!
5 I went to Excel Chiro after a friend recommended the place.  I don't live in LV so I was skeptical but my experience was great.  I would recommend it to anyone.
3 Appt was at 10:30 am. I wasn't seen until 11:20 am. My vitals, weight and temp were taken and i was escorted into a patient waiting room. Then doctor came in at 11:55 am. My visit was diagnosed within 5 mins and i was out the door at 12:01 pm. The doctor is very nice, thorough, and knows what he is doing. I gave it a 3 because of him. I feel like I waited way to long to see the doctor. Also, One of his receptionists needs a little bit more help with phone and front desk etiquette. She didn't communicate effectively. I was told to "do this" instead of "please complete this packet".
1 Here at ER right now and I can't even, I just can't watch all these mess, RN at the Nurse Desk is rude, no sympathy, the first time we walked in here she was chatting with this other nurse, didn't even greet us or told us what to do, 11 people are ahead of us. Been waiting here for two hours now to see a doctor, a guy here is on the floor because of pain and this RN was telling him "you need to get up now" like wth he doesn't even look okay and in terrible pain, another woman she called for information said she couldn't walk and needs a wheelchair, this nurse was like "why do you need a wheelchair hon" oh boy she just needs to go home now, this place is a mess, security guards though are helpful but they just need more help, needs more RNs and CNAs, haven't seen one CNA at all yet   Answer to Mr. Scott  I brought my husband to UMC ER for he was having a sickle cell crisis but we actually ended up going home without getting the treatment after waiting for two hours in the ER lobby. We couldn't wait anymore and my husband was just feeling more sicker upon sitting and waiting there that seems like for nothing. We were told by the guy nurse that the reason for the longer waiting time is that there was no doctor available to see us that time. So that's what we did, we waited though the ER guy nurse seems nice and that he cares genuinely it's just there's nothing else he can do more for us. I wish it wouldn't happen to anyone else too because anyone who's having sickle cell crisis should be actually seen RIGHT AWAY. We didn't mind waiting but two hours of being there was just enough for us to see what kind of hospital UMC is. There seriously need to be improved and done. Making a pt having a sickle cell crisis is a big risk for that person to be comatose and that's life threatening. The last time my husband had a crisis  we were at Valley Hospital. We went to UMC that time into thinking that it might be a better hospital from the look of the outside but we were greatly wrong I'm sorry to say that. I wish I am wrong and we were just there at the wrong day. The older lady ER nurse btw shouldn't be working at the front desk if she does her job like that. Maybe she's better off at a different department where she couldn't be handling and be the main lady to greet the patients.   Sent from Jozel
4 On entering  the office I was immediately greeted with a smile. The receptionist was very friendly. Paperwork was a little much but thorough which was good. I give it 4 starts coz the consultation seemed a little rushed. But I was adjusted well and feel much better than I did before I walked in there. I will definitely be back!
4 We have been patients here for the past year.  They have fixed their appointment line and I get test results faster in the past 6 months than I did last year.  The staff is always friendly and very personable.
5 I have only seen Dr Hirst 3 times, I feel amazing. I had back surgery in July 2013 and was in worse shape than before the surgery. My friend recommended Dr Hirst and im so glad she did. He is very kind and explains the procedure. I will definitely recommend him to everyone I know.
1 I have seen Dr Clark a few times. I am very disappointed with him. He does not care about his patients nor takes the time to research anything before handing out meds. One visit he saw me for 5 mins then started walking out and I asked him if he could look in my one ear (which takes about 1 minute) because it has been itching like crazy. He then rushed out and said he has more important patients to see. Another time my mother was with me (who also works in healthcare) and said he has no business being a doctor. Every time I have been there I have waited at least 45 minutes.  I just had major brain stem surgery and was in to have him look at the incision. He then told me to go to the ER because my blood pressure was low which is a result from my surgery. I then asked about getting a refill on my meds and he said it wasn't really important right now. I called the office today and told them it was an emergency and they did nothing.  While I was at that appointment my mom was in the room with me as she was getting a work physical. The doc saw me first without any paper work with my vitals but in his hand was my mothers vitals and paperwork. He then took my blood pressure about 7 to 8 times because I told him it was low. I don't think he knows how to take someones blood pressure. Or maybe he was checking it really well.  Dr Ferdowsian on the other hand is a pretty good doctor.
1 I could have received a better diagnoses from a circus animal. Went in for an eye infection and the dr on duty didn't even look at the spot I pointed out! He said he saw the bump I was referring to a few times and i had to inform him it was a mole! Twice! And on the opposite side of my eye! Never mind the spot that is actually swollen and hurts. He prescribed me an antibiotic for "inflammation", hmmm I didn't go to school to be a doctor but I think I know that inflammation doesn't require a antibiotic.   So frustrated, especially since I'll probably receive an unreasonable bill in the mail that I now have to pay for services that weren't even rendered correctly.   Bedside manner was absolutely terrible as well!
2 Not very quick for an 'urgent' care. I've been in the waiting room for 49 min already and I'm the only one waiting! I'll let you know if the actual appt gets better or faster.
5 I've been going to Dr. Spice Lussier at Desert Wellness Center since June of 2013. She is very knowledgeable and is a great resource of information. In Dr. Lussier's care, I have lost 28 pounds, and continue to lose weight, quickly approaching my goal! It has been wonderful to have someone that has taught me, and continues to teach me so much about living a healthy life style. She truly cares for the wellbeing of her patients and I'm so glad I've found her, my wellness doctor for life!
5 This place is fantastic! I need a practice that isn't 8 to 3 Monday through Friday. I need place that is thorough, timely, attentive and responsive to my needs. I need a place that does a lot their lab work in house. I need a place that can perform a great deal of services under one roof. I need a great primary care doctor. I need a place that can take me "on the fly" if need be. The point is so do you!! I could go on with my particular story but it would be far too long. Suffice it to say that if you are tired of the typical medical "all about the practice" and not you, then give this place a shot. I am so glad I found them and I venture to say you will be also.
3 I really like this location and the clinic overall. The only issue i have is that my female doctor has left and there are no other female doctors which I can see for female issues. I really miss Dr. Avery. She was very good and always explained everything to me including results and why certain tests were necessary.
4 I enjoy the studio and sequence and everyone is nice and pleasant.   At the beginning of class the teachers always talk about your Breath - How it should be long and full.   Would it be too much to ask the teachers to leave the scented candles out of the practice room so we can breathe? I see other students requesting that they be taken out but some classes I come to I end up leaving short of breath.  I would imagine there have to be more than just a few who think this way.  We're asked to not wear heavy perfumes or colognes, so I don't understand the reasoning to put a fake scent in a practice room that preaches breathing techniques?  I like your studio, I hope you take this to heart for I would hate to leave because of a simple candle harming my breath.  Thanks
5 I'm simply in love with everyone at EVFP! I have an amazing doctor; Dr. Timothy Baker, his staff is amazing as well! I've been a patient for several years however this is the first time that I've had to see anyone in the office several times a year due to medical issues. Every time I make an appointment it is effortless and can usually get in within the next couple of days, there are not any unusually long wait times, everyone is friendly and willing to help you, if you need to get ahold of your doctor, a PA, or an MA you can usually do so same day! If you have to leave a message they return your call in a very timely manner! All in all I would recommend everyone I know to go to EVFP because they are just that great! They have been taking care of my family for 15+ years and will continue to do so in the future!! Thank you to the amazing staff!!!!
1 Didn't even make it to the doctor. I walked out due to their horrible costumer service by the rude receptionist. She was rude and unwilling to help.
5 Having never seen a Chiropractor before, I was so thankful to have landed in the right place at the right time.  My back had been hurting after lifting a box. My pcp had no solutions. When I went in on May 5th, I had no idea that they would save my life by sending me to the ER immediately after recognizing there was something seriously wrong.  While I have no memory of the following week, I know that the office called my family to be sure I was okay--best customer service and concern I have ever received.  Thank you!
5 Your search stops here for the most intelligent, personable and gifted group of surgeons you will ever meet. especially Dr. Timothy Trainor!!   Between myself, my husband and our teenage son, they have done numerous surgeries to include total knee replacement on me (after several doctors over the years kept injecting me with cortizone shots and giving me pain pills). We also had neck surgery, back surgery, elbow surgeries and shoulder surgeries. All surgeries were a complete success and the pain has finally disappeared. I would trust Dr. Timothy Trainer and his twin brother Michael with my life. We praise God every day we found them and we will continue to refer everybody we know to them. Their bedside manner is unlike any others we have come across and as a military family, we have seen many doctors all over the world.  In addition, I cannot leave out Sarah (the doctors assistant). She is amazing and actually cares about us.  This is hands down the place to go for all of your orthopedic needs!!!
5 The price is right and they have everything I need. Classes, hot tubs, pool, hot sauna, tanning. Can't complain.
1 Avoid coming to this location!  I'm not sure why I keep coming back but this will be my last trip.  Today it took me 2 1/2 hours to see a doctor and it wasn't busy. On top of that the staff is incredibly unfriendly.  Save yourself the frustration and go elsewhere.
1 22 minutes on hold to inquire about making a new patient appointment.   19 minutes on hold to make the appointment.  23 minutes on hold to CANCEL.    If I could give ZERO stars I would.  There is no reason for such excessive hold times.   I called at 3 different times of day, so it wasn't like I was hitting the morning rush each time.  Staff on the phone was very short and unpleasant.
5 Rebecca is a lifesaver. I Crossfit and my muscles were long overdue for a massage. It got to the point where I couldn't weight lift because of it. Rebecca has been so awesome at taking care of my pain and discomfort. She's incredibly knowledgeable about the human body, not only that, but she has the sweetest soul and is truly passionate about what she does. She is really THE best out there.
5 Went to Dr. Sharma because I had been looking to find a new doctor since the one that I was going to (who was a wonderful doctor) was not coming back to practice. Trails Family Medical was very close to where I live, and, as I read the reviews on  Yelp, I decided to give this place a try.  First off, it was very easy to schedule an appointment on the same day...a plus because someone cannot schedule when they are going to be sick...none of this "we can get you in two weeks" business. Also, even though I was a new patient, the wait was not very long, but this also could be due to the fact that there were not many people waiting.  Secondly, Dr. Sharma is a very knowledgeable doctor...he is up to date on what is going on in the world of prescription meds....he knew exactly why I was taking what for...I didn't even have to tell him. He also informed me of what new studies have shown on a medication I had been on for years. Another nice thing is that Dr. Sharma does not prescribe unnecessary meds just to get you out the door....he listens to you, and then analyzes  and explains what is the best course to take....and he does try to help you find the most economical way to get your prescription meds, should you need some.  Perhaps the most important aspect about Dr. Sharma (at least for myself), is that, like my previous Doc, he is a compassionate doctor that does not scold or intimidate you...yes, he will let you know what tests should be done and how to improve the quality of life, but he does so in a way that does not make you feel that it is "do or die". This is important to me since I can be a worry wart!
5 Hands down the best Physician in Scottsdale. Found him after years of not needing a GP. Haven't found anyone like him ever that practices medicine! Bedside manner is tops and he actively listens while diagnosing. Honor Health should be thrilled to have him. I know I can now chill out knowing I have a doc that cares, who loves what he does and ALWAYS leaves me with a smile on my face on my way out of the office. His range of knowledge is unparalleled also. Love ya Dr. R.!
5 Due to unfortunate circumstances I had to go to physical therapy and I wasn't happy about it in the slightest. I was recommended this place and was encouraged to go and I am more than happy about every single visit at this office.  I cannot believe how pleasant this experience has been given the situation. The staff is incredibly compassionate and they make each visit very comfortable and actually quite fun! I look forward to my PT days because not only do I leave pain free, I can feel myself getting stronger and the staff makes every visit a great one. I feel welcomed when I arrive and scheduling appointments has always been fast, easy and convenient with Kathleen! The ambiance is that of a cozy gym and it feels a lot more comfortable than a doctors office setting. I would recommend this practice to anyone looking/ needing physical therapy. Nick runs an incredible practice and has some pretty amazing and dedicated individuals working beside him. I'm sad to go but happy to be recovered!
5 Man weiß vorher auf was man sich bei Kieser einlässt. Krafttraining für Rücken und Körper im gesunden Maße. Ich finde es super, die Mitarbeiter sind nett und der Trainingsplan wird super auf die eigenen Bedürfnisse oder Einschränkungen angepasst. Duschen und Toiletten sind sauber, leider keine kostenlosen Parkplätze.
1 This is so ridiculous. We are sitting here in the waiting room while 4 workers sit in the center where you register for quick care and they're practically screaming to one another about what they're going to do during the day and other patients files. Not only is that unprofessional but I surely don't want my business blasted out loud for everyone in the waiting room to hear.   We've been waiting for about an hour now listening to these people and no one else in the waiting room but three other people who came after us. We would go somewhere else but we've already been waiting for an hour and my husband is in severe pain.
5 Doc C was a great help understanding my child's conditions and needs. If she goes back practicing somewhere I'ld really like to know where so we can maintain the patient/practicioner relationship  RB  248-561-6374
5 I feel at liberty to express how pleased I was with my experience. The beginning of this week I wole up with the worst pain in my shoulder. It literally felt as though I had a Charlie horse in my shoulder. I had tried to no avail to use my own methods to reduce the knot that was causing me such pain. I am not one for medicinal cures so I began searching for a good place to get a massage. In my search I came across this site and masseuse.  I will admit I was slightly put aback just as any woman would about going to someone's home. I am so glad that I read the reviews and did not let that stop me. He has a very clean professional looking room designated for his craft. I informed him of my problem areas and he set to work on them. Not only did he assist me with my painful knot, he found and worked through knots I didn't even know I had! Needless to say I will definetly be going back, and dragging my skeptical husband with me ;)
4 Other than the sort of nasty floor that turns my feet and ballet flats black, I really enjoy the classes at Metro.  The staff and instructors are super friendly and welcoming, there is live accompaniment and plenty of room even in a full class, and the instruction is very good quality.  I've only taken ballet class there but the three different instructors were all very good at walking the line between being very structured and strict but allowing for a variety of levels of experience and expectations among students of all ages and shapes and backgrounds.
1 Never again, Made an appointment, got in, saw Jen. Seemed nice enough, a bit rushed but okay. At, what I found out was the end of the appointment, she said she would be back, I still had a couple more questions. I sat there for a while then peeked out the door and asked if she was coming back. "No she's not coming back but I can leave her a note". So I tell the assistant? what my questions are, he scribbles them down. I'm thinking I'm going to hear from her in the next few days. Nope, nothing. So I'm left sitting in limbo. While I was there I got a prescription. Jen told me to hold onto it as she was going to check tomorrow about getting it sent in for me. That was a few weeks ago. I call today to find out that she did nothing with it. So now I'm almost out of pills and don't have any coming.   Since she didn't follow up with me on anything, I told, whoever I was speaking to, that I had a followup appointment and that since Jen couldn't handle a simple thing, like a prescription, that I want to cancel and find someplace else to go. I was promptly hung up on. I can only assume that they cancelled it since I obviously ruffled someones feathers.  I get the feeling that it's a get you in and out fast and get the insurance company's billed kind of place. I really think this is an 'all about the money' practice.
2 good gym, and classes but had become far too crowded to a point to where you can't get a spot unless you book a week in advance. even then it's tough to get a spot in most classes.  I signed up for a year but am now very frustrated.
5 Rob is awesome and has great stories! He's really nice and cuts straight to the point. He helps you heal, gives you homework and the rest is up to you. The staff is great. The front desk personnel are extremely pleasant and knowledgeable. I had a knee injury for more than 6 months and they were able to get my knee back to where it belonged.  Thank you so much to everyone there!
5 I almost didn't come here because there were a lot of bad Yelp reviews but, they were open late and I didn't want to go to the ER instead. The lobby was clean and nice looking and the girl behind the desk was sweet. I was seen by Dr. Peter Tretheway and his assistant Nick. The Dr. Was so very kind and compassionate but super professional. I was out in 20 minutes and had everything I needed. He was also very non judge mental about no insurance and rearranged the medication plan to best suit my situation. I would certainly return if needed.
5 Love this place. The staff is friendly, and Dr Dan is the best. I will always come here with any of my physical therapy needs. Would suggest to any one of my family members.
5 I have never been so impressed with a care facility as I was with Advanced. My dad was there for 45+ days and they were amzing. The staff is friendly, they actually like being around patients. They did so many special touches for us - private dining room for dad's birthday, party room for watching a football game with dad's  college friends. Every day I felt blessed that dad was there. !we some PT & OTHER - they didn't give up on him. He ended up stronger than he had been in 6-8 months. The nurses were great, best aides ever. I felt like we were leaving family when he checked out. Can't  say enough wonderful things about them!
5 Dr. Que and his staff are awesome. I go here for my lower back pain. They treat me good. I feel I'm sit up straighter and my legs is not getting fatigue that much. I'm getting a lot of energy now. It's been a month and half and I'm feeling great.   I'm moving back to Cali in a few days and I will miss coming here. I hope I'll find a place like this in Cali to continue my progress.  For anyone that wants to wake up happy and get better, go to this place. I highly recommend this. Wish I found this place sooner.
5 Tried this out last weekend for the first time. Had Stephanie, who was absolutely amazing. I joined.  This is the best non-resort massage place I have found in the entire valley. I am finished looking.
5 Here is what what I love about Dr Luca, he actually works to solve your problem, not just give you another drug to mask the problem.   He is a naturopath Dr so insurance maybe an issue for you, but spending $ with Dr Luca is way cheaper in the long run than spending endless $ on drugs that never solve your problem.  Dr Luca is old school, he spends the time to listen to you, your not just another patient to him!!
1 I tried DeRosa Medical for the pellets a few months ago.  The insertion was a little rough and hit a nerve or two.  I didn't experience this with SottoPelle.  My BIG complaint is the charges.  This company does not ever really tell/explain what the possible costs could be up front.  What the total cost is if you pay cash and what the total charge would be if using insurance.  I have insurance so I went the route of using insurance not knowing the possible outcome.  I just received a bill from DeRosa and it shows my insurance paid approx. $1200.00 and the remainder balance of $2200 and change is due from me.  There is NO way I would have had this procedure done if I would have been told upfront the total cost was $3500.  Come on, Really, and they want you to come back about every 3-4 months to do it again, meaning about $10k to $15k per year.
1 Absolutely terrible health care provider. I went in for the first time to this office and my experience as a patient was worse than I could have imagined. First off, the doctor reminds me of that doctor from the Simpsons that will perform heart surgery on you for 5$. He is so creepy and when I came in, I could visibly see him in the back fixing his hair in the mirror, and walking around doing literally nothing while I waited for 30 min. When he walked into the exam room, he didn't shake hands or give any personal touch that a "doctor" might be able to comprehend is necessary and advantageous to his private practice. Further, the equipment is literally from the 1800's, I stepped on a scale that said I was 190, I'm 220 pounds... they literally WROTE DOWN my medical history whereas most reputable Healthcare providers use-I don't know- a computer? Worse yet, they put that piece of paper into a file that looked like one Benjamin Franklin would have used when he was researching electricity. At the end, he needed to get my medical records from my old Healthcare provider and he literally gave me a form and said, "Go fax this to health span and bring your records to us." I was like.... wtf am I paying you for? That's literally the worst doctors office in Ohio.
1 Horrible family practice. Dr Shilpa Gujrathi is a terrible physician who ignores your symptoms. You will end up waiting to be seen for nearly an hour and then receive subpar care. My suggestion- find a more reputable family practice. This one is terrible. You'll die if you truly have something that is terminal because they will not care enough to figure out what is wrong with you. Protect yourself, find a better doctor than the ones at this practice.
5 Scott Pensivy and his staff is amazing! I was actually getting relief from my intense back pain (I say was as my insurance then denied going). All the staff went above and beyond what any therapist has ever done. I hadn't been in over 6 months and called for a referral to a pain management specialist and Julie and Lindsay went way over board to make sure I got in to see the right doctor. I wouldn't recommend any other Therapist! Outstanding!
5 I had to write a review due to the lack of stars!! I was a new patient here. I had an amazing experience with each appt I had. Dr.Cunningham is the best Doctor I've ever seen! He actually cares about your health. My appointments are always on time and the staff is very friendly.  Being new here to Arizona I'm grateful I have found my primary doctor. This office is also very easy to find!
2 Lots of paperwork to fill out on the first visit (maybe 5-6 pages), then I got hit up with a co-pay, then they sent a bill for $5! Presumably because they changed me the wrong amount in the office.  Then they called me and told me they didn't take the insurance that they took when I was there.  On my fist visit they put me with a PA not a doctor.  It is not ideal to see the doctor on the initial visit to a new "Doctors" office. The P.A. told me I had to come back after fasting for a second checkup and then come back again to discuss the blood test results.  Keep in mind this was just a checkup. To my knowledge they just wanted me to get hit up with multiple visit charges.   Nice crap on the walls and fountains in the lobby does not equate to good healthcare. The old "stake and sizzle" deal
5 Recently took my 5 year old into this Urgent Care for a double ear infection after our pediatrician's office was closed for the day.  We were very lucky and it was fairly quiet when we went in - so the wait was really short.  I think we waited less than 10minutes.  The nurse and doctor were both great.  they were quick and efficient, but attentive to us.  We had a fairly clear issue, and they resolved it quickly and were really great with my son, who was clearly nervous about a trip to the doctor.  I would happily use this place again.  According to my paperwork, our provider was Shung.  He was great!
5 Great medical team. I have been coming to these guys for about 4 years now, and they have provided me with great medical support.   I've used the physiotherapy services here and they are also really good, didn't try to sell me on more therapy and told me what I could do on my own for rehab.   Very convenient location too, though parking in the area is a bit of a problem.
5 How can I start ,this place is AMAZING!!!! Starting with the staff Tia & Melina at the front desk are so friendly and helpful.Every question or problem I had, they were so happy to help me in anyway. Kevin & Yairth (assistant) are so friendly and  they make sure that you feel comfortable in every way. Jobelle (Hygentist) OMG!! The BEST!! What can I say ,I'm so terrified of needles but Jobelle, she has Magic! I had to get a deep cleaning and I didn't feel any pain what so ever .I mean she numb me before giving me the shot . have never been to the dentist and not feel pain, but I'm telling you this place cares about how you feel and how they can make you feel comfortable. Thanks Jobelle.  Now for the doctors,  Dr. Khanh and Dr. Davis are so great too! They take their time to get to know you and answer all your questions.You never feel like your being rushed. Very professional and they make you feel right at home. I truly love this dental place. This is the best in Vegas. If you really want a dentist place that will take good care of you, this is it. Thank you to Wonderful Smiles Dental, you guy win it All.
1 BEWARE! Just got a collections notice from a service from 5 years ago - only moved a year ago and was in their office many times between this service and this notice. Tried to contact office to clear it up. Have paid every other bill over the years, but that didn't matter. This was my first notice received and am willing to pay original amount (less additional charges) but billing dept at Dr Wachs says no... won't even take message to Dr. Wachs to ask for reasonable review. Office won't talk to me or give me details on what was performed because they turned it over to collections. Collections doesn't have my details, just total amount (that has since tripled in fees and interest). The fact that it was 5 years ago when the service was performed and they are just trying to "rebill" my (no-longer) insurance provider?!... of course it will be denied, but now I can't get the information needed to even try have insurance cover it. The only option they leave you unless you want to have your credit impacted is to pay the bill... This is criminal practice - of course I don't have paperwork after 5 years and office won't give me anything? It felt like the slimiest shakedown and most unethical approach I have ever dealt with. When you try to reason with unreasonable practice policies like these, all you can do is recommend to RUN AWAY FROM EVER USING THIS PRACTICE!
2 Staff. Is nice, but the. Care is not Worth paying for.  Been here twice in two months and left unsatsfiied with the Drs advice and them not prescribing needed meds to make me well.  Just a IF YA DONT FEEL BETTER SOON COME BACK.  ya let me shell out another fifty dollar co pay for nothing. I might as well throw the money in a slot machine somewwhere.
5 I have been having some issues with a knee I injured a few years back so I was looking for some help and advice.  Rosemarie gave me great advice with different exercises and self treatments I could do while at home.  Not only did she give me exercises and advice she also explained what was causing my problem so I could get a better understanding of what was going on with my body.  I was never aware how much the body was connected to other parts but now I know!  Rosemarie was very passionate about her craft and it helped ease my concerns.  I felt like I was getting the best advice from someone who truly cared.
1 NOTE: I went to a special event, and NOT a yoga or pilates class. I went to a special $15 session of gong meditation led by Lisa Lipp New Years Eve. The gong meditation was absolutely fantastic...once we were allowed to do it. Unfortunately, we didn't get to actually do the meditation until we had been trapped in a room for an hour, listening to a sales pitch from Landmark, and Sumit forcing us to close our eyes, sit up, and listen to/sing to songs before and listen and sing to a Christian song after the meditation. I was so appalled and offended by the disrespect of being trapped in a room, and given a sales pitch, that I (and many of the others that had to sit through the first hour) will never go to this studio again. I will definitely do another gong meditation, but at any other business.
5 Best massage of my life. Am I exaggerating? NO. Mike Fuhr is a genius and an artist and I wish he lived in New York. Go at once. It's everything you need right now. Amazing.
5 Everyone from Dr. Troy and  Dr. Jared to Nikki up front are so professional and efficient but also sweet as pie. I truly recommend them for any physical therapy needs.
5 We moved here from GA. We were referred here from another special needs mom. I'm so glad we found it. The therapists have helped my daughter come so far with her fine motor skills. Also with her sensory issues. I never met an owner who was more interested in being involved with the patients. She has taken more time than necessary to make sure I felt comfortable with my daughters services. I would definitely say trust your kids with way to grow. I'm glad I did.
5 TR3 is way different than other gyms I've been to, but in a good way! It's open 24 hours so you can come whenever you want and isn't super busy so you can come in and get to your workout right away and not wait in lines. I really enjoy the turf and the different equipment they have unlike other gyms, and the trainers are willing to work with you on your schedual which is GREAT with my busy schedule. Everyone needs to check this place out it's fantastic!
1 I wish I could give 0 star.  Warning: NEVER GO THERE. If they say the waiting time is 1 hr, you probably expect it to be longer than 2 hours. Dr Shi is very unprofessional.  The receptions are very rude and impatient. PLUS, the clinic is dirty, I feel like they never clean up the dust on the table. No more other comments.
5 I've found Alpha Chiropractic to be a very friendly, caring physical therapy/chiropractic office.  I'd recommend to a friend.
1 Very Poor Customer Service!!! Prior to seeing this Chiropractor I called to see how much a visit would cost with my insurance and he told me $25. I sent my wife in for 2 visits which she paid $25 each time. I later received a bill from his office for $100, when I called to ask about it he was extremely rude and said the insurance wouldn't pay him so I owe him $100. Then he said he would give me a cash rate of $40 a visit, I said well she already paid you $50 so if I pay another $30 it will be settled. He then gasps and said "frankly I'm pissed off"...I'm jumping through hoops for $30...I don't have my notes on the file so will have to look through credit card receipts to see that you paid the $50, then out of my disbelief he hung-up on me. This guy needs a good lesson in customer service. I will definitely not be back to his office.
3 We came here for our friend's birthday.  All of us had massages which we thought were oK/good but definitely not amazing.  facilities are also ok, but the treatments are Very exp for what you get.  It came up to $422 + tip for 3 of us
5 The PAs and doctors here are great! Thorough, kind and very knowledgeable. The staff is wonderful - so sweet and patient. Yes, you will probably have to wait, particularly on the weekends, and/or if your appointment is later on in the day. But it's worth it.
5 After being in pretty severe pain for several months, I finally went to my doctor who diagnosed me with a pinched nerve in my neck.  She highly recommended Heidi and her team, and she is part of the Tricare Network!  I was a little leery, but figured it's better than going through surgery.  I started my care with Heidi with visits 2 - 3 times a week for about an hour each.  She and her team were awesome!  Heidi takes great care to explain what's needed, and does so in a way that helps you understand your treatment plan.  She is very visible while treating multiple patients at the same time.  It never felt crowded.  She and her team provide individual attention and keep a close eye on you to ensure you are doing your exercises correctly, and offering encouragement.  Very friendly without losing the professionalism.  Between the exercises she gave me, her massaging of my upper back and neck area, and that awesome traction machine, she had me "cured" in a month.  I am now pain free without surgery.  I would highly recommend these folks to anyone needing physical therapy.  If there was an option for 6 stars, they would get that rating!
5 This practice is made up of several orthopedic doctors. I see Dr. Bruns. I have been going to him for years for various things- and am always happy with the outcome. Last year I had 2 total knee replacements (I call them January and June)  and now I am a new woman. I have no pain and can walk without any problems and no limp. Rehab was tough but not compared to living with the pain I was in. At least I knew there was a light at the end of the tunnel. When I go to my appointments I have my questions on my notes app ready to ask and Dr. Bruns is always happy to answer all of the questions I ask him.  I must also compliment his assistant Julie. She is the best. She always explains everything you need to do or how to use anything you are given. I especially like that the practice has their emails on their websites so if I have a quick question, I can send her an email and not wait for an appointment. She will either get me the answer or let me know what to do.  Lastly, one of the other doctors in the practice had to have a knee replacement and he chose Dr. Bruns to do it. That says something.    There are also 2 offices. One is on the NE corner of 56th Street and Bell and the other is on 7th Street, north of Thunderbird on the west side of the street.
3 I normally really love the little clinic. They have little to no wait time and all the nurses I've seen have been awesome. But I recently wasn't feeling well, having had flu symptoms for three days I called to see if I could be treated and was told yes over the phone but when I came in it was a different story. They had no idea what to do with me. I was told all the same stuff that I had already read online and was sent out the door being told that if I didn't feel better in a few days to come back or go to the ER. Serious waste of my time & money so I was pretty disappointed.   My advice for the going to the little clinic: they are great at minor illnesses: colds, ear infections & physicals. If it's something more than that I would go to your regular doctor or urgent care. Otherwise it's just a waste of your time and money!!
4 ** Hello ... Yelp ... Anyone home?  This place is now called Ironwood Urology. Please update. Sent you the requested information. :) **   After a long, distressing three months of misdiagnosis galore "Back injury - Go see a physical therapist; enjoy going broke!" "No, you have a 13cm kidney cyst!" "Just kidding, it's severe hydronephrosis!", my primary care doctor sent me to Ironwood Urology.    Dr. Bigelow is the bees knees! He was the surgeon that removed my right kidney and is now my urologist.   He was great with me and my family before, during and after the procedure.   Initially, I actually saw another doctor that was leaving the practice before being passed to Dr. Bigelow.  Found that unlike a lot of doctors, he took the time to explain to me what exactly a UPJ obstruction was (I didn't even ask, wow!), and was quick to reassure me that:   1) Nothing I "did" caused my kidney to die, as it likely happened in-utero, and  2) Nothing my mother "did" during her pregnancy caused this.    I especially appreciated him understanding that as a serious athlete, getting back to training was of great importance to me . . . While not compromising my safety or rushing the healing process.  Everyone in the practice has been pleasant, promptly returned phone calls, and speedy lab results.   Wouldn't hesitate to recommend Ironwood Urology, Dr. Bigelow or Dr. Avila to any family and friends.
5 I had my physical therapy at Jackson approximately 3 years ago. My only reason for posting a review this long after the fact is that I wasn't using Yelp at that time.  I went to therapy for my knee after an orthoscopic surgery for approximately 10 weeks and they did a fantastic job. Kind, caring and compassionate staff who really helped and sincerely cared about my well being.  I would highly recommed Jackson Physical Therapy to my friends, family and you.
5 I have been coming here since I moved to Arizona, and I love it. They genuinely care, it's easy to schedule an appointment, and they rarely take long. The front staff is so nice and helpful. Between myself (pregnant and unpregnant), and 3 kids, I swear I have seen every doctor and each one has been great. If you're pregnant, get Jennifer Allen as your obgyn, she is the best!  Their new facility here is amazing!  It's state of the art and fancy. It's also nice to have WIC in the same building,  so I can take care of everything all at once. The WIC ladies are incredibly nice and understanding and accommodating.  They also have free wifi, always a plus. Let's just say I live in East Mesa and gladly drive 30 minutes for appointments here.
5 Was looking for a place to get a massage downtown that fit the following criteria 1) close to financial district 2) clean and 3) good value for service. Step Up Massage and Rehab fit the bill quite nicely. I saw Quincey for a 30 minute appt over my hour lunch and she was awesome, alleviating tension in my upper back almost immediately. Service was complimented with a hotel towel at the end, the perfect touch before going back to the office. Loved that they do direct-to-insurance billing. Will definitely return.
5 Great clinician - provides care according to the current best clinical evidence.  Many don't.  If you you a spine problem, Dr. Shane Sullivan is a great choice!
1 I was going to give his office a 3-star review because I liked him as a doc, but his office staff is not so good.  But then...  ....I called to get an emergency referral on October 30.  I got a return phone call on November 7th.   ....and, after 20 years as a patient, I was told to find someone else because Sparling was only seeing Medicare (I'm 62) which really means "Profits over Patients."     As mentioned above, I had ALL the signs/symptoms of a detached retina (which is considered an emergency because it can cause loss of sight.)  So, I called his office to get a emergency referral.  I never got a call back until 8 DAYS LATER!!!  In the meantime, I found a CARING physician and opthamologist and THESE doctors are monitoring my visual well-being, thank heavens.  Sparling is an ok doc, but what good is ANY doc (or their staff) who do not communicate or follow thru...or even has some semblence of care?  Finally, they charge YOU for "Follow-ups" but never charged my insurance provider.  My provider said they are NOT suppose to charge for follow-ups.  Buyer beware.
5 This facility is excellent in every way from the staff to the cleanliness. From day one I knew this was a top notch rehab when my physical therapist spent two hours with me, getting to know my history, going through basic stretching, even getting a massage! I thought the massage was a one time occurrence but it is a standard part of each therapy session. My therapist is extremely knowledgable, thorough, helpful,and caring. I have noticed that in all of the other therapists as well. The assistants are friendly and professional and get to know everyone on a first name basis which of course makes you feel right at home. I am going to be sad when my therapy comes to a close! Highly recommend to anyone that has back problems or has had back surgery.
5 I came in about 2 months ago and couldn't lift my shoulder past a 90 degree angle, it took a few sessions and a lot of ice but Dr. Legg got my shoulder back working with full range of motion! So thankful for what they've done for me in the past few months and am glad to be back to where I want to be!
5 Great place for a massage. Very relaxed atmosphere. I felt comfortable immediately. The massage itself was wonderful and reasonably priced. Small busibess which will get my business again.
5 AZ Spine Disc and Sport is amazing!! My husband and I both come here and we love it, and love everyone who works there! Especially Dr. Rudd who is a rock star. I have had "treatment" in the past from a few different places for my lower back, but this place had exceeded my expectations! They do so much more than just the normal adjustments. There is so much more involved, and they really do care. I have learned so much about my body since I started coming here! Love them!!!
4 Been to this urgent care 3 times. All 3 went very well. Great customer service. The best thing is the docs don't pressure you to take a bunch of meds. If you're the holistic medicine type they respect that and know some knowledge of home remedies and alternate routes to cure.  The only reason 4 not 5 stars is that the wait was quite long. Came in to get ear flushed (probably the most simple and short procedure of 3 min) waited 30 min to be seen.
4 I was looking to get a vasectomy, but my insurance requested a referral from a physician. I did not have one so I happen to drive by EVFM and figured "what the heck"...best decision ever I called to set an appointment and upon calling I didn't wait long( I believe one ring) and Marti was the one who picked up. I was pleased with how nice and caring she was with my needs to find a physician in that office. I was set up with a Dr. Gold who at first glance looked like a grumpy old man but BOY WAS I WRONG! he was just as caring as Marti and actually listened to not only my request but offered some advice about my weight and what I needed to do to better my health. I am glad to say I have a primary care physician and as long as Marti and Dr. Gold are there....I am a patient for life. Thank you EVFM for the great customer service and excellent choice in doctors. Thank you.  P.S. The Medical Assistant also kept me in the loop on the status of my referral by giving me a courtesy call when I was cleared for my surgery.
5 I went for my new patient appointment, and everyone was perfectly pleasant. They have a mixture of MDs and DOs which is nice because I wanted to see a D.O. and one just so happened to have the earliest available new patient appointment! I don't have insurance, so he worked with me a little bit on that and also went over the test I was getting done to order them by priority, so if I couldn't afford all of them I knew which ones weren't critical. Dr. Diditch was the one I saw, and he was very personable. Quick and efficient, but didn't feel like he was skimping. I will need to get an ultrasound as well, and he talked me through how different hospital systems work with uninsured patients. Also, they give new patients a t-shirt, and I'm not a huge t-shirt person, but I really like theirs. And it's within walking distance to my house, so major bonus points.
5 I saw Robyn 6 weeks after having my second baby via csection. She was so knowledgeable on pelvic floor and core health and gave me great information and steps to take to begin repairing and getting stronger. She was warm and easy to talk to and made me feel very comfortable. I will be seeing Robyn at least 2 more times to continue my healing. I highly recommend her!
1 this place really sucks! estimate to leave is 6hrs today. this is unacceptable!!! can't give 0 stars. if I could I would.
5 Erica Eaton PA is hands down the best health care provider I've ever seen. She takes her time, she is VERY thorough and she is an outstanding listener.  Trust me this woman doesn't miss a beat!  Even when 3 people are talking to her at the same time (me and my 2 kids all in one room after a long, long car ride :)  She is courteous at all times and VERY well educated. She has practiced medicine all around the world, providing aid and wellness to third world countries, she is truly a blessing to all. It is so refreshing to meet a person of her caliber who remains so humble at all times. She's cool, laid back and gives an all around great vibe. Whether you live in her area or not she is worth the drive. You won't be disappointed!
1 The worst clinic I've ever been in, the waiting time is at leat an hour and u won't be treated respectfully and professionally. Never go there!!!!
2 Don't go! I wished I read the reviews before ordering my coupon. The desk staff were actually super nice, or so I thought, and let me redeem before it expired so I could get my massage in. I had to fill out what looked like a doctor form although it was just a massage! I didn't fill in my address because I didn't see the point, I wasn't getting mail or a bill. They seemed really irritated by that, nothing I've experienced at a spa / office doctor massage appt either.  The pressure from the massage was out of this world hard, I normally have to tell my masseuse to do it to the point where they think it actually might hurt, but during this I shed a tear. I wanted some areas that much pressure and others not, and she kept told me to stop tightening and said when I go over a knot people often stop breathing and tighten up - uh, yea, that should tell you something. Always respond to your client and adjust accordingly. I told her I wanted full body, but she just focused on my shoulders and didn't even go over my feet and tailbone which I circled as concern areas, didn't go over my front legs, arms, hands, temples, and I had to ask her to do my back legs. Then she finished 4 min early, most masseuses are super nice and tell me they're going right up to the last minute.  I've never thought, "I wonder when this will be over..." during a massage, I'm a massage addict, I've been many different places all over the world so I have a good idea of a "good massage".  She used a mint smelling lotion, I didn't get any options, surprised she didn't use or offer oil, I mean, I figured I'd be asked if I had any allergies like they usually do on their forms in offices and spas. I like that oily soft feeling afterward, but I didn't get that with this lotion.
5 I recommend Ignite PT completely. I had serious pain in my neck where I could not move from left to right, unbelievable pain. A friend recommended Joe and his office. He took me right away and worked on me for over an hour. That was a Friday by Monday I was moving my neck. Joe even called me on Sunday to see how I was. After a week of therapy, I am back to normal. I do not recommend places lightly, but I will tell you, if you should need therapy for any reason, this is where you should go.
1 We had to leave this office because our insurance changed. They gave me incorrect information about being able to take our new plan and didn't seem to care that I had to take my two girls to a new doctor as a result. Ok, fine, no need to care about two random kids I guess. But now, nearly a year after leaving I received a phone call reminding me to schedule a check up. I called to say my daughters have long since left, and was met with an abrupt apology. A few weeks later, I receive a post card as a reminder. I guess it was a blessing in disguise that my daughters' records are no longer being kept by this disorganized group.
1 THE WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE. I was there right when it opened after waking up with what looked and felt like pink eye. Filled out new patient paper work and was told my copay was $75. WHAT? My copays are $30. Didnt understand what they were trying to explain to me so I just paid it. Called me back and did an eye exam and was seen by the nurse. Then the idiot doctor comes in and she is by far the dumbest human I have ever interacted with. Tried to make me feel like it wasnt pink eye and then told me I just have allergies in ONE eye. Yeah, cause that happens. I have never had allergies before. She looked at my eye, told me to go get a wash from the pharmacy and left the room. No rx, NOTHING.   As the day proceeded, my eye got worse and worse. Wash and eye drops didnt help. At 7:30 pm my boyfriend tells me we are going back to urgent care and we are getting a script for antibiotics. We walk in and he is clearly upset, tells the front desk staff that we need to see someone because it is not getting better and it is clearly not allergies. I am seen right away and he comes back with me. THE SAME LADY walks into my room and tries to tell me again that it is allergies when it has clearly gotten worse. My boyfriend interjects are tells her we need a script of some sort and she says she will write an antibiotic script for pink eye but it might not work. Just as she is leaving the room, my boyfriend mentions "she is pregnant, I don't know if that changes anything". The lady turns and looks at me and says "no one told me that, that changes a lot". I AM 35 WEEKS PREGNANT AND LOOK IT. She was such an idiot, who doesn't notice an almost full term pregnant woman.   Worst medical facility ever. Never going back
5 Found this place because it is close to Changing Hands Bookstore where Gary Vaynerchuk is speaking next monday Oct 26 2009 and I want to bring a group to yoga first. This is the closest place.  I dont do a lot of Bikram but do enjoy it every so often and the studio setup at BYT is really good. The heating system in the room is setup so that you get consistent temperature the whole class. The teachers are all top notch especially Reba and they do a really awesome deal for $25 if you are new where you get 2 weeks unlimited for free.
5 I was recently at The Valley Pain Center and got 3 different shots for a hip issue and not one of them worked  !!  Will never go there again, went to see Michele Hitchcock at the Core Institute and she recommended Dr. John Kearney in sports medicine at the Core Institute and I explained my issue with him and he knew exactly where to put the first and only shot !!!  I am now pain free and I would highly recommend both Michele and especially Dr. John Kearney to anyone that has pain and may only need a shot !! Thanks again !!
5 Today was my first visit to Massage Envy. The front desk staff was very professional and attentive, and I got THE BEST deep tissue massage I've ever had from Tiffany!  I will definitely be back.
5 Starting with the front desk, Connie is incredible. She always greets you with a smile and is always willing to help.  Sara, well she is a great PT Assistant, knowledgable, patient and caring.  Her patients seem to thrive.    Then there is Kari. Well she is in a league of her own.  She knows how to correct your problem with the right amount of exercise, therapy, toughness and tenderness to get you healed.   I wouldn't go any where else.
2 I Just moved to Canada, this is the first clinic I visit. Dunno how it works in Canada but the wait is awefull. I need to see a dr to see if he agrees to be my GP. The wait is long. I saw two drs one seemed knowledgable the other one was just too straight faced I couldnt understand his words or sentences. I just dont see this place to be my go to clinic when it comes to my general health.  Or maybe its like this everywhere I need to wait and see.
1 Went here for about 18 months.  Everything was fine until they had to do something besides a routine checkup. I needed blood work done and I had to call over and over to get results.  I had a second round of blood work and the same thing happened.   You have to keep calling to find out your results.  Then you are delivered your results by a member of the front desk staff.  Yes, the front desk staff who has zero medical training.  Ask to speak with a provider and you will get a sarcastic response of, "the doctor isn't sitting here waiting on calls."  I don't think it's too much to ask for, at least, the nurse to call with results so they can explain them properly.  After all this I was told they really don't treat my symptoms and I need to go to another doctor.   Would have been nice to have been told this upfront before I paid for office visit, 2 rounds of blood work and wasted 3 weeks.  I'm disappointed because I did like them at first but their responsiveness and the professionalism of the front desk staff is severely lacking.  My family will be changing providers.
5 I am so impressed with the compassionate and professional care at this facility. Everyone from the folks that deliver food, the occupational and physical therapists, nurses, aides, Dr. Prabhakaran...the entire staff are so kind and caring. I highly recommend this facility to anyone who is in need of care!
5 I  was recommended to Egoscue by my Physical therapist. He told me due to my insurance he was limited to what he could do for me and said if I wanted to recover from my injuries it would happen at Egoscue. I did recover and discovered it helped my Fibromyalgia. I have been going there on and off for about 7 years, why? With my fibromyalgia I find great relief from my pain and I have better overall functioning when I participate in the Egoscue method.  The owners John and Billie are fabulous and very helpful. Maria my therapist is wonderful! When I go there on my own to do my menu, they will offer a tip or add an exercise if I mention a pain or discomfort I may be experiencing. There are truly caring professionals and I would highly recommend them to anyone.
2 I wish I could give a doctor review and a front desk review. I've met with Dr Hailstone about 4 times and each time was perfect. I never left with any doubts or questions. So Hailstone = 5 stars. The front desk, ZERO! I had a few cosmetic things I that I was considering getting done depending on what the out the door FINAL cost would be. I was told many times that it would only be "x" amount for each item. It was a perfect number so I scheduled two appointments. I wanted to be 100% sure what the cost would be because like I said, cosmetic. It wasn't anything I needed to get done but the cost was reasonable. I was billed 8 times the amount and was told I need to become more familiar with my insurance plan. Yeah, I probably should. But don't tell me what it's going to cost and then send me a bill in addition to that. I'm tempted to just cut a deal with a collection company so these cons working their front desk don't suck more money out of clients.
3 My stay there was above average with bumps along the road.  I feel the place is very new and staff will rectify the problems/kinks within a few years or so.  As for the nurses, I had many good LVN's and CNA's.  One LVN that stood out to me was Christine.  She was a real professional and a sweetheart too.  She really cared at helping me out during the tough times.  As for the CNA's, there were some wonderful ones that stood out: A wonderful duo by the names of Jerome and April were amazing.  You could not find a better team than them.  They helped me even when I was not assigned to them.  They would come in to check on me at times which was so nice of them.  Jennifer was absolutely a wonderful and highly skilled professional CNA (I am hoping the name is right, she was an adorable Samoan young lady).  There were two "Wound Care" specialists by the names of Marcus and Kim: They were absolutely fabulous.  As for the people that cleaned my rooms, they were all really professional and sweet, but one stood out BIG TIME!!!  His name was Theo.  He always came in with the biggest smile.  His positive energy could cure cancer  He loved what he did as seeing patients and acknowledging us and making sure we were okay was something extra special about him.  He really stood out to me in all of this place, as he was everything a SPECIAL person is defined by in my books.  I would look forward to his daily visits, and if he was not scheduled to do my room he would make sure to pop in just to say hi with his big smile....always made my day!  The two receptionists that answered the phones were absolutely Angels to say the least. The two drivers were very nice. There was Maria and Cobra (Yes that was her name).  Cobra would go the extra mile and say hi when I was in my room.  She was such an Angel....I forgot one amazing woman by the name of Nati (I am sure I have the spelling wrong).  She was my special CNA.  She was a precious soul.  She would do everything in her power to make me feel better; such as storytelling, preaching, motivating, etc....I wanted her as a mother, a wife, a sister, but most importantly a friend.  There will never be another human being with a soul like hers.  I miss her as I write this.  Not all was rosy, as there were many times my pain meds were late. I also want to mention how I wish there were someone assigned to the rooms of patients that are crying or screaming for help....that was quite bothersome to me. I bring this up because I am an advocate for those patients that can't speak up for themselves. Lots of minor errors that frustrated me at times to say the least. The one BIG negative was an LVN by the name of IRIS....She came into my room with absolutely ZERO bed side manners.  She was like a pill pusher on the run.  I believe that she was my nurse the night I got back from a surgery writhing in pain and crying/screaming through the night to the point of exhaustion.  She never cared to check in on me during this time to see how I was or how she could help.  She was very intimidating to say the least. Nurses should become nurses because they want to HELP the patients.  I had some arguments with her and eventually made sure she would never be my nurse again.  I filed a complaint about IRIS to the head of administration- Josh Roberts.  Josh assured me that the situation was addressed and the appropriate actions were taken to educate IRIS on being a better nurse. BTW....of the few people I knew, they also had problems with IRIS....although she denied that at the time, which really irked me.  , Mr. Roberts was very approachable and available for me whenever I needed him.  This guy is a WINNER.  He really is an asset to Canyon Vista Post-Acute. Also Cynthia the entertainment person was sweet. More games need to be added to the daily schedule although.  Last but not least was another valuable member of the Administration team by the name of Kenye.  Kenye was my MVP of the whole place for me.  She came in my room the following day I arrived and welcomed me and assured me that I could go to her with anything, and she would do her best to resolve any problems.  Well, there were more than a few times that Kenye came to my rescue when it seemed no one else could. The place at times seemed overwhelmed and over or under staffed. I wish them well.  Sincerely, Kenny P.
2 The negative reviews on here are extremely accurate: INSANELY long wait times (2+ hrs to get called back for vitals, WITH an appointment!!), and rude staff. It's pretty sad because Dr. Adams seems very nice and competent. I can't imagine people will continue to go to her if she doesn't do something about the above 2 things mentioned.  Also, Dr. Adams needed to refer me to an oral surgeon. When I was checking out, the secretary told me they they didn't have any oral surgeons to refer me to, and that I would have to find one on my own! What?! Definitely in search of a new doctor......
5 They took my insurance and kindly agreed to bill for copay. The dr was fast, friendly and to the point. He valued my opinion in my care. We discussed meds and work. Even offered to fill meds in office, although my insurance is a bit better deal. I will be back for medical needs!
5 Dr loo is one of the few MDs left that will sit and talk with you face to face instead of at a computer.  I like his office staff and never had to wait a ridiculous  amount of time to see him. Usually if you call for an appointment you will typically.have to wait a maximum of a week. My only beef is if you need to cancel an appointment they do not have an answering service and have to call around their schedule not yours. I have been charged the fee for not canceling prior to appointment time but not without several attempts to call them on my part.
1 The 3 reviews there was at the time of my review entry is so far from reality. The reception over books both walk-ins and appointments. I've been there 4 times, and each and every time almost half of the walk-ins wind up leaving because they're been told it would be 1/2 an hour and they're waiting there at least an hour and a half. Genesis walk-in clinic still bills OHIP regardless of whether you stay or leave. For booked appointments, just as frustrating. Be prepared to wait at least 45 minutes past your booked appointment time. Once again, even those with appointments wind up leaving because of the lengthy wait periods.  On weekdays Genesis opens at 09:00am, at which time there's already several people lined up to get in. The doctor does not arrive at 9:00, but rather closer to 10:00am. So by being first in line you're still waiting aprox 1 hour plus to see a doctor.  The other operational aspect to note concerning Genesis clinic is their part time doctors are newly registered physicians. Thus the level of medical expertise offered to patients is reflective of their experience. Or shall I say lack there of. However what they are masterful at is maximizing patient billings versus actual patients seeing the doctor. Given the number of patient  "walk-outs",  the billables far exceed actual doctor visits. I wonder if this is part of their operational revenue strategy ??   I would strongly suggest avoiding this clinic, even if it means commuting to Milton or another surrounding region such as Brampton or Mississauga. Local residents of Georgetown do not regard this clinic as desirable given their experience with all of the aforementioned issues and then some.
5 Love Dr. E I have been going there for years and the staff is wonderful very friendly!
5 New Age Physio has an amazing Massage Therapist called Marie. She helped me enormously by relieving my upper back pain and piriformis caused by long distance running. Definitely the best ever massages that I've ever had anywhere, I can highly recommend.
5 I can't say enough good things about their dental clinic. They were VERY thorough and professional. They took plenty of time to do a thorough initial exam. The specialist who did my root canal was amazing. He did a great job and I nearly took a nap while he did his work (in about 45 min.), and I'm someone who hates the idea of being drilled. All the work was supervised by experienced professors (dentists who had many years of experience in their own practices). The students were in their final year of study and very capable and professional.  I never felt as if they were rushing me out the door in order to move on to the next patient. Makes sense, since they're not trying to pay for the dentist's Mercedes or the significant overhead that comes with a private dental practice. Speaking of the fees, I estimate that I paid about 40% less than you'd pay a dentist in a private practice for a root canal and a gold crown. The only drawback I can think of is that the scheduling is dependent on their school schedule (exams and holidays, when work can't be scheduled), so it might take a bit longer to complete a course of treatment. But the very high quality and affordability of the work more than makes up for it. Two thumbs up for Midwestern U. Dental Clinic!
1 they had the best price around for the item i wanted.  on arrival the the was not as described in the ad.  clearly their error not mine.   when i called, they said to ship it back at my expense, if the item proved to be not as described i would get a full refund otherwise there would be a 30% restocking fee.  the return shipping was $25 so  i called back and requested a prepaid shipping label which was granted by another agent w the proviso that i would be charged back for shipping if my claim was untrue.   i took 20 mins and took a bunch of photos to show the item i bought was the wrong size using a dial caliper and tape measure,  then wrote a detailed description of the error  i only got a partial refund.  never got any response to my calls, had to file a time wasting dispute with paypal, which they did not respond to, then had to file a claim which they did not respond to,  then paypal had to investigate and issue the remaining refund.    this is dishonest customer service, not poor service.  it is systemic, see the review by Amy L on 11/3/12  or KN on 3/23/12
1 I am a current happy camper over at the Glendale location, Anthony Nelson and Kendra Scott have always treated me with respect and compassion and just all around great customer service.  Last minute I needed an appointment and the Scottsdale location had an opening. Dr. Asha Sethi in my own words is one of the worst physicians I have ever had to experience. After having an ongoing problem and knowing my body was still off I went in for an exam.  During her exam which required a speculum SHE DIDN'T LUBRICATE IT. She argued with me that she didn't see anything and I was fine, I tried to explain to her that I have been on weeks of different antibiotics and was worried about getting a bacterial infection and in fact felt like I had one at that moment. I explained the medications I was on, for how long, why I stopped which ones and why I finished.  She arrogantly argued with me about my case and that I was fine and needed nothing but would send my culture to the labs anyway just in case.  Visited my regular OB 5 days later BECAUSE I WAS STILL HAVING PROBLEMS  ohhhhh turns out I had a yeast infection which my ob knew because of the lab report from my culture AT ARROWHEAD HEALTH CENTERS... No one ever called me to prescribe me a medication, I was walking around with a bacterial infection for almost a week because this doctor didn't take the time to LISTEN to her patient not to mention she made me exam extremely uncomfortable.   Oh ya I also drove 2 hours round trip for that and will have to pay for the visit after insurance.. Joy Will never recommend this specific office, again I love the glendale location but this specific doctor has awful people skills.
1 My sister was admitted early morning on a Tuesday. Kelly was the best RN in the ER. Started CT and somehow nothing was readable so they held off until the next afternoon to retest and didn't allow her to eat a decent meal to fill her stomach. That's understandable due to not knowing if she'll need surgery, however surgery was the next night at 8. It went smooth, Surgeon Richardson was so kind and assuring. Her night nurse Kristi room 206 was so sweet and gentle when caring for my sister as I stayed for two nights. Friday morning, my sister woke at 7am and clicked the nurse call button asking for pain meds. We waited due to shift changes but then it turned into 7:30. So we had called again because the pain started to become unbearable. The nurse then comes in 5-8 minutes later not knowing why we clicked the call button her and then again leaves the room without any help. We wait, and we wait then clicked call again. Then I walked to the nurse's desk. I had stated I called THREE times. And her nurse BRITTANY also room 206 responds to me "shift change was at 7am, I ACTUALLY WAS ONLY CALLED ONCE". That's when I became aggravated due to the fact that in the medical field you should never argue back with the patient even when they're wrong. I found it very unprofessional and quite lividly rude. Then for some odd reason a different nurse came in with my sister's pain medication. Along with all the other reviews left for this hospital, I can see as to why it was rated so low. Nurses should be there to care for patients gently and kindly. As for this nurse, I was very unhappy by her professionalism.
5 I absolutely love Blankinship!! Their physical therapists are the best and their office staff is spectacular. I feel so much better after treatment and am going to go to them if I ever need a physical therapist again in the future
1 It's time for me to leave the practice and follow my wife (who left in February and is the subject of my last review). Dr. John Rigby Patterson is trying to commit insurance fraud by insisting on an office visit before he will refill a prescription I've been on for 3 years under his maintenance. As if the long lines weren't bad enough, this man does not observe the Hippocratic Oath and is acting very non-Christian. He's a bad Mormon for not caring about his fellow man.
5 I could not ask for a better Dr. Dr P is one of the most competent dr I have had the chance to meet. Our whole family goes there.
2 I really loved this place at first. Started with a complementary Belly Dance class, Sheri is an awesome gal. Then I moved into having my yearlys with Mary Anne. She was attentive to my life and she had a great presence about her. Spent time talking to me and keeping notes. I met Dr Jones once in that time and was less than impressed with her bedside mannor but hey, I had the choice to see Mary Anne instead, so I did.    My biggest issues were the front desk staff had VERY poor customer skills. Very much like a typical Drs office which isn't what this place is supposed to be about.   When I became pregnant eveything started off great, supportive etc with Mary Anne. Then once I told them that I wanted a home birth but had not found the right midwife for me yet, everything changed. I never felt welcome again. They did my appointments but not with the same warmth I felt prior. My last appointment spured my midwife search faster than anything before. I met with Dr Jones. She began stating were I would be delivering the baby and I reminded her my chart said I was doing home birth to which she bluntly said "Then why am I seeing you?" Maybe blunt is her style, maybe she had a valid point..I don't really care, because it was extremely unprofessional.  I can't vouch for her skills as an OB but her demenor is less than desirable. I would expect a person truely passionate about babies and women would gladly assist their paying clients in their quest for the best care available when they themselves don't offer the serivce...Networking with other providers...maybe I'm wrong.   After my birth I did go back with a breast issue my lactation consultant couldn't address. I was in tremendous constant pain. They gave my breast a glance with me just pulling my shirt aside, misdiagnosed me as having mastitis. I returned again in more pain. I could barely function with out crying. Dr Jones saw me and pressed directly on the intensly inflamed area on my chest and I burst into tears. Unbelievable. At least I got an amazing Breast Surgeon referal out of the deal but that was my last straw with them. I have never returned, not even for my follow ups.   Because they were so cold to me during my pregnancy and after, they lost my business and my referals for everything else.
5 There is no reason to go to any other family practice. The office is pristine. Coffee, water, television, toys and magazines. The staff is friendly, attentive and helpful. I waited a bit but it was well worth it when I finally met the doc. He is amazing. So knowledgable and personable. We chatted and laughed and talked about the area since I am new to AZ. He is smart and got me what I needed. His practice is well run and CLEAN. He is the best family practice med doc I have seen in my adult years and plan to bring my whole family here. Keep up the good work!!!
1 I went there for a few years as I had lucked out with a wonderful doctor.  Happily he left about a year ago and I was able to find him.  This morning I got a call from them at 7:45 about a program (I am guessing as I could not understand the person calling).  Going to that office was not enjoyable.  The staff hardly smiled, if you needed a RX refill you had to go to the office to pick up the prescription even if you had been to the doctor that past week but forgot to get it.  They would not call them in.  The one time I saw Dr Forte she was in and out of the room so fast.  Then I saw on my EOB that they billed my insurance for a well visit the day after my actual visit as well as billing for the actual visit.  I never had that well visit and reported it to my insurance.  When FFP received the chargeback they tried to bill me for the visit.  After getting it across to the billing person that I never was there that day and I was the one who reported it to insurance they said I did not owe it. In my opinion that facility has to be the worst I ever went to.
4 I purchased a groupon for one back massage here after passing by this place several times. My experience was very pleasant..  The appointment was in the afternoon and they were running right  on schedule. The massage therapist, Kristen I believe, was professional, courteous and worked on all the areas I pointed out. The massage room was cozy, low lit and tranquil. She worked out some kinks I had gotten myself into recently going back to bikram yoga. All and all for the price(of the groupon) I would come back due to the convenience of the location and they're professionalism. I did not have any problems before during or afterward.
5 I came here with a Groupon for 2 massages and booked my appointments with Sarah. She is AMAZING! I always leave completely relaxed with less tension. The facility is nicely decorated and very clean. The entire staff has always been very friendly and Christina at the front desk seems to greet everyone when they walk in by their first name, which is not only a good sign of returning clients but she has awesome customer service skills. After my 2 massages I ended up buying the monthly membership and having been going once a month for 7 months now. Make an appointment and book with Sarah!
5 Was recommended to this place after my knee surgery. This operation is first rate in all regards. From the time I called to my appointments and follow up everything has been exceptional. Well run with very professional and competent providers. I would highly recommend them for physical therapy. I am a physician and would not recommend anyone else after my experience here. Excellence!
5 Eric and the team are amazing! I own a gym and have competed in powerlifting for years and no matter the issue, I trust CPT with my recovery and on going rehab. I've recently had a total hip replacement and in only 2 months I am back to almost full strength.
5 I ruptured my Achilles' tendon and after surgery my doctor recommended the Keith Kleven Institute for my physical therapy. The staff is GREAT! Stephanie and Jared are great. I was hesitant to go to physical therapy because of the cost. I had been doing exercises on my own, but once I started going here the difference was incredible! I feel so much better, and my swelling is almost non-existent. They are the only pt place in Nevada with a pool treadmill, which is a great way to mix up your therapy.  I started PT about 5 months post op and I wish I had started sooner. Don't let the cost scare you off. The Keith Kleven institute has me well on the way to a speedier recovery!
5 I have a ruptured disc and arthritis, I've been worried about getting chiropractic work done. My boyfriend insisted on taking me in.  This place was very detailed and took their time with me, they required a lot of information and that definitely makes me more comfortable. The staff was friendly and very caring. I will be back soon!
5 I have been going to Dr. Patel since my first child was born over 10 yrs. ago.  Since then, he has taken on the rest of our family including me and my husband.  He always gets you in whenever you need it and his staff is nice.  I like that he himself treats his patients and he doesn't have nurses and PA's doing his work for him.
5 Dr. Docasar has been my doctor for many, many years. She has seen me on a moments notice when I thought I felt a lump and walked me off a ledge. Compassionate, gentle and comforting. I also used her for a weight loss program.   I am so happy she now in Summerlin. Thank you, Doc!
5 I recommend that anyone experiencing any physical issues, please call Aqua Therapy before going to any other therapist for physical therapy. Customer service is five star, facility is clean, friendliness and professionalism. Privacy is five star. I had severe neck stiffness, fatigue and stress. Over a period of time and consistency, my neck recovered, fatigue is gone. My stress is better managed because of the exercise and stretches specific for my needs.
5 I found Dr. Swenson's office out of sheer luck. Sick as a dog, suffering from seasonal allergies so badly that I thought I had pneumonia (what?), I scoured my insurance company's Web site for a doctor who could see me. Incidentally, I'd already had two laughable trips to Urgent Care under my belt and was out a hundred bucks.   I got an appointment with Dr. Swenson and left feeling better already. The office is spotless, the staff friendly, accommodating and uber-efficient. Dr. Swenson is kind, confident, and knowledgeable without so much as a trace of ego. He listens intently, asks questions, offers and discusses options, walks through them, and, best of all, he doesn't keep you waiting forever. I also go to Dr. Swenson's colleague Tom Willim for allergy treatment and have found their chosen method (sublingual drops) to be highly effective.   North Scottsdale Family Medical Center has helped me with a variety of things, so much so that I've recommended them to several family and friends. Now I'm recommending them to you. Trust me on this one.
5 With a growing catalogue of minor aches and pains I finally reached out and asked friends to recommend a good masseur - and out of the long list I received, Mathew was the only one that came up twice. A quick skim through reviews proved that there were many satisfied customers,  so although he wasn't the cheapest option I made an appointment.   The massage room is warm and comfortable, as is the welcome. I described the problems I'd been having and he took copious notes, probing for more information, and discussing the possible causes in relation to musculature. After some experimental stretching to confirm his suspicions it was time to do some work.   Any massage is likely to cause at least some discomfort, and I was prepared for this. I'm told that he will adapt according to the client's preference - anything from a purely relaxing session up to full on remedial agony. The oil used is grapeseed, which is popular in massage as it's not too greasy and doesn't usually cause any allergic reactions. Once it's over there's the option of a shower, which is a nice touch for anyone who doesn't want to get their clothes oily.   I've been three times now, and at all times I've felt like a valued person rather than just a customer. He keeps track of any changes, altering the treatment appropriately, and clearly prioritises the client's comfort and/or recovery. I haven't miraculously 'recovered' but not only am I feeling steadily more flexible, I'm also far more conscious of when I'm doing things that will exacerbate problems which helps me not to make things worse. I'm definitely glad to have engaged Matthew's services.
5 Justin, Andy, and the staff were outstanding. I was completely satisfied with their plan and support concerning my rehab. They helped me learn how to help myself  and heal. It was a pleasure to have met them all. I would recommend them and the facility to anyone who needs rehab.
5 I really don't understand why there is negative reviews .. you get what u pay for .. the Zumba classes are AWESOME I love Laura , SAIRA , Helene, and Lalaines, Maggie , tawanna there all AMAZING .. I got pretty much all week .. really like the gym and it's big then most of the EOS gyms
5 I have been seeing Dr Hajbandeh since March of this year and each time for very different reasons.  Love his bedside manner, he never makes you feel rushed, he explains everything he is doing.  He is concerned with the "whole person".   I would highly recommend him.
5 I have only been going for about 2 weeks now but I can say with complete confidence that the entire staff is outstanding.   Rich (my PT) is friendly, kind and professional. He listens to my concerns and explains everything in detail so I'm always on the same page. The PTA's remember me by my first name and genuinely care about my well being. I actually look forward to my appointments because I feel so welcome.
5 LOVE  LOVE  LOVE this studio! The teachers are amazing, they are super friendly, caring and knowledgable. They have great times that are available for all schedules, and an express one hour class that is awesome!!  Would definitely recommend it anyone looking for a studio to call home!
5 Fabulous massages by Heather!! Every time! She is professional and dependable. She goes above and beyond to provide the highest quality services with competitive rates!
1 Do not go here for a check up.  They made me wait in the room for an hour before the doctor came to see me.  And she just walks in like nothing is wrong.   The doctor sat down and just asked me a few basic questions about my health history and squeezes my legs and arms and says "you seem healthy".  I ask for a blood test and they send the lab work OUTSIDE of my insurance network.  A month later, I get a bill for 1500 bucks for a blood test -____-.   Save yourself the money and the headache.  Go elsewhere
5 OH MY GOD! I'm 5'9" 246 lbs. Im a RN so im always on my feet. I lift weights and never stretch so needless to say I'm tight all over and have many knots. Having gotten 2 massages a month at countless different places asking for "deep" tissue, Jim was THE ONLY ONE to really get into my overworked never stretched muscles. He cracked my back aligning it. My headaches went away. I don't get cramps in the middle of the night. Instead of getting a massage every other week this will now be my weekly routine and only with Jim. I HIGHLY recommend Jim for ur massage needs.
1 This Emergency Room is the worst. The registrars are sitting behind their desks gossiping about patients. Security is standing around laughing at the gossip. Heartless and brutal. Patients are sitting in the lobby, moaning and groaning.   Why sign up for a job that puts you in a position to genuinely help and care over people if it's clearly the bane of your existence?   #WhereIsTheLove
1 Ordered item in April 2015. Never arrived. They said it went to wrong address. They accused me of typing In the wrong address. No way possible, as I don't know anyone at that address, so it couldn't be a default entry that went wrong. They said they would refund me. No action. Then they let me know it was returned to them by wrong recipient but I would need to wait until it reaches the warehouse for a refund. That was in May. It's now July and still nothing. I contacted them today and they said once it reaches their location I'll get a refund. I wonder if they have a bridge to sell? NEVER use this company!! Buyer beware!
5 This is a wonderful office for our whole family. Dr. Dy sees both my husband and I and our 1 year old. They are ALWAYS on time. I have never had to wait. The team there is friendly and efficient!  I would recommend this family practice to anyone.
4 I visited Concentra two times in recent months after a car accident and then another minor injury.  I was new to the area and did not yet have a primary care doctor and I was dreading an urgent care visit.  Surprisingly, the wait time for both visits was reasonably short.  I saw a different doctor for both visits, but both were great.  Good bedside manner, attentive, and capable.  They called a few days after each visit to check in and make sure I was comfortable with the medication and improving as expected.  And to top it off, the charges were quite low (in my opinion) for the services completed, which was great because I was paying out of pocket as I had not yet met my deductible.    I will, however, add that my boyfriend has also gone there (he saw a different doctor).  He came home complaining that she cut him off and would not let him speak or fully explain his pain/symptoms.  He felt she did not seem all that interested in diagnosing him.  Instead, she just wrote him a prescription and told to follow up with his primary care doctor (which he does not yet have).    Clearly the actual doctor has a huge impact on your overall experience.  I will happily return if I find myself in need of urgent care in the future.
1 Awful experience. After putting up with rude front desk staff and inaccurate lab results I finally left. Every time you go they will take your blood from their in house lab. It's not necessary and they've misread the results. The front desk staff is the most unfriendly I've ever encountered and if you need test results for another doctor good luck getting them to provide the right results for the current year. How hard is that? Turn over of PA and NP is high--do you blame them for leaving? Like I said, I left and I'm a lot happier!
5 The future is here! Magenta Health is a high-tech, paperless medical clinic in Riverside. All the appointments are booked online and communication is done via e-mail. I was glad to see they were still taking in new patients.  No receptionist to deal with or calling-in to see when your doctor is available; as a patient, this information is available to you online.  Once a doctor has been assigned to you, an introductory meeting takes place where the patient and doctor decide together if it is a good fit.   At your in-clinic appointments, patients check in on a tablet, and immediately, your name appears on the dashboard showing the approximate wait time and room number assigned.  I'm so glad that I became a new patient of Magenta because Dr. Cristina Musngi is a wonderful doctor! She's very caring and never rushes through the appointment. She's very holistic in her approach.  There is a new clinic opening up in the Beaches come fall.
3 Dr. Dean is great if you don't mind waiting 45 minutes in the exam room prior to his arrival. This happened on 3 appointments. I agree with other reviewers that the support staff could use a little training. The office keeps wanting to charge me a higher copayment even though I show them eob statements reflecting a lower amount. Come on....
5 Doctor Peter Reed is a kind and genuine human being. He truly cares about the well being of man kind. He makes sure you are being monitored correctly and your medication is working. He believes in preventive medical processes and procedures. I highly recommend him and his entire staff. They are always kind and welcoming.
5 Excellent customer service, they took me immediately as a walk in and the Dr is very warm and personable in his approach. Definitely recommend!
5 I've been going for quite a while. Ashley is so smart it's scary! She is a wonderful, caring, knowledgeable therapist with endless venues to help anyone in pain! Lindsay is excellemt as well and Nicole who is at the front desk is friendly and carimg. It's a pleasure to walk in and be greeted by her! You really need more stars for this place!
2 I've been going to this practice for a few years now. First I was seen by Gary, who sadly left the practice, and most recently by Julie. They were both personable and thorough.  Now for the past couple of years I suffered from depression and anxiety and Julie seemed to always have just the right script to ease my troubled mind. Although as my medication list was growing, she felt the need to refer me to a psychiatrist to dispense my meds. At the end of December 2016, I got food poisoning and didn't take my meds for about a week. After recovering from the food poisoning, I felt good...normal....without any meds in me for an entire week. I soon found out that I still needed to take my acid reflux meds, but I no longer was experiencing the depression or anxiety. Woo-hoo!!! Fast forward to April 3, 2017.....the anxiety is back, but only in mild fashion. My script for Xanax XR had lapsed, but I still had 3 pills remaining. Took one a day for two days and was back to normal. So I called my pharmacy to have them request a refill from Julie @ Phillips Clinic (this way of getting prescriptions filled is the preferred modus operandi of Phillips Clinic). No response by Tuesday April 4 so I called my pharmacy to see what was going on. They had not received a reply from Julie so I asked them to resubmit it to Julie again (this, by the way, is the standard method of getting prescriptions refilled by the Clinic....call, no response, lather, rinse, repeat).  So I called Phillips Clinic the same day to make sure that they had gotten the request and would fill it. Was told that Julie had a big pile of requests to go through and would try to get it processed. I get a call about an hour later from someone at the Clinic saying that Julie had denied one 30-day prescription. The reason for the denial is that Julie didn't want to take responsibility for giving me a medication that she'd given me many times before....just not in the past 3 months. She wanted me to go to a psychiatrist to get my meds from now on.....all I needed was one 30 day supply and that was all. Perhaps she wants me to get my acid reflux meds from the psychiatrist as well. Because we ALL know that heartburn is a mental problem(?!?!?!?)   So I'm left with this quandary.....do I continue to see Julie, who is for some strange reason afraid to prescribe medications that I need....or do I find a doctor or PA that is up to the job of practicing medicine??  The answer is in.....I'm changing my medical professional from Julie@Phillips Clinic to Gary Manley, the PA that I saw when I first started going to Phillips Clinic that resigned. Yes, it means going to an office that is 1/3 of the distance to Phillips Clinic from where I live and it means going to a medical professional that is not afraid to actually practice medicine and prescribe medications as warranted.  Sorry, Julie.....perhaps you'll be better off treating patients that don't actually need any medications.....it's safer for you that way, no potential pesky lawsuits if you make a mistake. So goodbye, Julie. May you find your bravery and confidence in the art of medicine someday soon.  And by the way......my nurse, Juanita, is always the highlight of my visits!!! Keep up the good work girl!!!
5 Jon and his wife are such sweet people and Jon's expertise is fantastic. He helped me recover from a terrible ankle sprain and even managed to make my recovery fun.
5 I went in for my Achilles and ankle injury. It was definitely mind blowing how he was able to find the trigger points of where my pain was. I'll be going back to see Scott next week.. I could feel a difference already! Thank you Scott for an amazing job!!
1 Bad choice in coming here. Been waiting over 2 hours and still have not been seen by anyone. There were only two other people ahead of us... Doctor finally comes in, never apologizes, starts to examine me, but then gets up and leaves without word, comes back in and nothing again... Bad manners, even my ten year old was appalled.  But, like anything, I won't base my opinion on a one time visit. I will give them another try if I ever need to come again.
5 Dr. Frye and his crew they always is very friendly very professional  I love to go to the clinic !! Thanks you Dr Frye and his crew.
5 Dr. Koch is fantastic.  He is attentive, responsive, and cares that I leave feeling better than when I came in.  His staff does an excellent job at fitting me in even with short notice.  Dr. K knows his business and has helped me improve my quality of life!
4 Have been having knee pain for a few months, and my doctor referred me to Welch. It's a nice office, and a large roomy therapy space. They took their time with me during the intake, and really watched how I walked around and moved my body to see what might be wrong with my knee. What they discovered is that it isn't my knee at all. The pain is a result of other muscle problems in my hips and glutes. I appreciated learning this! They are a bit pricey, but you should check and see if your insurance plan covers it. I was happy with my first session, and will continue to see them. I can't wait to get running again!
1 I'm surprised to see great reviews.  I called to schedule an appointment for my son @ the Scottsdale location  but all calls went to voice mail. This was 50 minutes before they closed and never got a call back. Next day still no call back.  Frustrating because my Son's sports medicine specialist referred us.  I didn't wait and went with a better physical therapy provider who understands the urgency of PT.
4 i had a livingsocial coupon for 1 month, and sadly, i got sick halfway through the month and didn't really get my $'s worth. BUT, i got a good feel for Bikram.   I like it, but wouldn't do it as a regular practice; primarily because you do the SAME exact routine each time. i get bored. i know, it's supposed to be good for you to do it that way, but my mind wanders.  my recommendations: chug water ALLLL day, and then drink a coconut water 30 min before class. you will barely need to touch your water during class (which is better!). screw the yoga mat, you really just need a large absorbent beach towel (i think they want you to bring the mat, and it makes you look like you know what you're doing, so why not.). sit closer to the windows - it's cooler on that side of the room! wear pants/leggings - otherwise you will not be able to grab your legs well during the "windmover" pose.   don't feel intimidated if this is your first yoga class or first Bikram class - the teachers are all pretty cool and helpful, and NO ONE cares about anyone else when it is blistering hot in there and you are sweating like a leaky faucet. trust me. it's important  to be able to see yourself, so I recommend going to less crowded classes. the 6pm class is the craziest!!!   i like that they have showers in the locker room, annnnd shampoo/conditioner/body wash/face wash/dryers for you to use. so nice!   if it wasn't so pricey, i would probably try to go 1-2xs a week, just for the fun sweat factor.
1 This is an awful place. There's one MA for the whole clinic. I had to wait 3 hours just to get a simple TB test done for work. Definitely won't come to this location next time
5 I have been using Dr. Dykema as my Aeromedical Doctor for years. She is fantastic. If anyone needs a great doctor for your flight physical, look no further.
5 I'm not sure how many of you have had an MRI but they are not pleasant however when you are greeted by individuals like Beatrice at the front desk and then by individuals like Juan it truly does make a difference in the experience. I would recommend this simonmed over the others.
5 Great friendly staff that care and I am so grateful to find this place. I would recommend anyone looking for a good doctor to come here and see Dr. Alfreda. He is a great doctor who cares about his patients.
5 Nicole at Chandler Family Chiropractic and Carson at Robertson Family Chiropractic are WONDERFUL! Everyone in the office truly cares about you and your progress. BTW, Massage therapy here is the BOMB!
1 I had been looking forward to my physical Therapy that I needed for my legs after a fall a year ago and was very disappointed.  I was placed on a very low circuit which had only minimal results.  I was amazed that there was not more hands on and with the minimal effort on the staff's part I wasted my precious appointments and will go else where in an attempt to find a group that will actually make an effort for my recovery.    If you do decide to use this organization, I would advise you to make sure you get the plan in writing just to make sure that you both understand what will be accomplished and gives you a tool to hold them responsible for the work they do.
1 scam scam scam!! do not waist your time! this doctor displays no integrity and her staff lacks knowledge! please save yourself a headache!
5 I dealt with Naturopathic Doctor, Sarah Vincent and it was the best experience I've had with any doctor.  She was extremely helpful and actually took her time in explaining everything I needed to know. She gave me lots of tips on how to get my health back up without having to change my whole around.  I highly recommend this clinic to anyone and everyone. :)
5 Carlo was an absolute dream! He listened and worked with my areas of issue and just worked miracles. I haven't felt that relaxed in a long time and he was sweet and charming. I'm planning on making my appointments with him more frequent. Highly recommend him to anyone with chronic joint pain. He's LGBTQ friendly and will make you feel welcome.
4 After doing 8 weeks of OHIP covered physio at Bridgepoint post knee replacement surgery, my surgeon recommended I find a private physio clinic to get me more range of motion and mobility.  I also had a wrist issue that was caused from using a cane in the first 2 months after surgery.  Based on Yelp reviews, I started at Cornerstone and the office is nice and modern looking, the receptionists all young and pretty, but I don't care about that, I care about getting better fast, since I don't have insurance and am paying for these sessions out of pocket. and after a month, I wasn't seeing results in either of my issues.  I ended up trying another clinic based on a friend's recommendation and found it to be a better fit for me.  But I give credit to Cornerstone for reaching out after reading my review here on Yelp and going above and beyond in trying to see how they could improve my experience and learn how to better serve future clients based on my feedback.  So I added an extra star.
1 Love my Doctors at AHC, both Dr Morton (PC) & Dr Vosler (Pain Mgmt). However, I cannot clearly express my frustration when dealing with the support staff there.   Between my wife & myself we have spent countless hours on the phone with Aetna- Arrowhead Health Center-Frys Pharmacy trying to get 2 prescriptions filled over past 2 weeks. We ended up paying cash for medication because it was needed. We finely got the auth and Frys refunded us.  2ndly, I had blood drawn at the Glendale facility on July 23, 2015. It took 4 phone calls & 3 WEEKs to get those results.  That was 2 weeks ago & I am still waiting for AHC to provide Aetna with correct info so will authorize the medication.   Throughout these situations my wife has left 4-5 messages for a Supervisor to call her back regarding these challenges.  As of my writing this review she has not received one return call. I did receive a call back from Dr. Johnston,  (one of the owners of AHC) after I physically went to clinic.  I must say I was not impressed with her response to my issues and we are 3 days post her call & still no medication...........  That's my recent experience at Arrowhead Health Centers......
5 I am so excited that I found See The Trainer Sports Medicine Store. Being an ATC, I always need medical supplies for sports coverage and taking care of sports injuries in my business. Before See The Trainer, I had to order supplies online and wait for the shipping of the supplies, but now I can just drive a couple miles down the road and they have everything I need. Scott and his staff are wonderful people and very helpful! Prices are great too! I refer patients to the store quite often now! Love the ability to do this. Highly recommend Scott and See The Trainer to anyone needing ANYTHING to take care of an injury!!!
5 Awesome guy, I was nervous at 1st never really had a doctor since I got out of the Navy just clinics for std checks, but this guy was so cool and laid back, a couple of laughs and really down to earth with you. I truly advise anybody that is unsure and want to get check out I definaly recommend this guy, even though he is located in Scottsdale, he doesn't have that Scottsdale attitude, like some people do he is actually genuine and understanding, Again I enjoy my visit and I can honestly say I found me a doctor!!!!!
1 If I could rate 0 stars I would. My son has been seeing Dr Vu since newborn and the past 3 years have been HORRIBLE. Yesterday's experience was the icing on the cake. My 6 year old son was POSITIVE for strep throat, after 2 hours of waiting we finally left the clinic at 4:55 pm (they close at 5). 3 prescriptions were to be sent to the pharmacy. They never were sent!! How convenient? It's after hours now, and the after hours nurses don't have access to records. I was furious. I called the office today 4 times- the girls at the front took a message stating someone would call me back. NO CALL BACK. I am beyond furious. My poor son has 0 antibiotics, and no medications that will help cure his strep. WOW crap service. I call the after hours nurse again asking what she suggests "going to urgent care"... So I can just hand out another copay!? I am NOT HAPPY at all.  I will not be going back to Dr Vu's office. The nurse Sherrie is also extremely rude, seems like she hates her job or is a very unhappy person. Horrible horrible place.
5 Today I had a really good day after my allergies shot Wow I am happy I was unable to sleep for so many nights I been taking Claritin D for so many day for my allergies but those pills helped  my allergies go away but I couldn't sleep and soon the effect  of the Claritin D go way my allergies comeback hitting me hard I fell good now thank you doctor Rogelio machuca and all his personal in the office also I got extra  prescription for just in case that I need.....thing that I can not get with my own doctor and my own heath insurance because the last time I got allergies they told me to go to get something over the counter at Walgreens wow big help we are paying health insurance also a co payment and still we don't get help
1 Visited the clinic on 1533 E Willeta St. Worst doctor appointment experience of my life.  The two best words to sum up this clinic are slow and incompetent. Waited a whole hour after my appointment time before I was even called up even though 5 people who arrived significantly later than me were seen promptly. Doctor Chioma was unwelcoming, unknowledgeable, unprofessional, and verged on hostile. She made me feel extremely uncomfortable, then she abruptly left the room and didn't continue the appointment, she was replaced a few minutes later with an equally unknowledgeable doctor who proved just as useless.  Then a 3rd doctor (Carlos) came in and attempted to save the day and promised me he would take care of everything. That promise proved to be false when unbelievably a 4th doctor entered the room to tell me they wanted to refer me to a specialist when I know that is not necessary because I have been seen by a family doctor multiple times before for this same issue. The entire ordeal lasted over 2 hours and yieled absolutely nothing.  How many incompetent doctors does it take to tell a patient they don't know how to do their job? In this case 4. This is definitely a clinic for low income families that can only afford second rate care. I wouldn't come back here if you paid me.
5 They are generally a walk-in clinic, but I am seeing Dr Yang as a primary care physician. I have never had an issue getting an appointment. Dr Yang and the other staff are super nice. Easy going clinic.
5 Last summer, my fiance started experiencing moderate to severe back pain.  Upon the recommendation of my cousins, we called and were able to make a same-day appointment at American Chiropractic Center.  When we arrived, we were greeted very warmly at the front desk by Susan.  In fact, we were greeted very warmly by everyone we met, from the X-Ray technician to Dr, Amoia, the man who would end up treating Bryan on each subsequent visit.  We have been really impressed with the service and level of care we have received on the many visits we have paid to this office.  We have never had to wait more than five minutes for a scheduled appointment, everyone remembers our names, and when Bryan had to cancel an appointment upon the advice of the doctor he saw at urgent care one weekend, Dr. Amoia via a call from Susan called to check on him and find out what was going on.  It is clear that every doctor, technician, and therapist we have seen take great pride in what they do and truly care about the well-being of their patients.  Thank you, Drs. Amoia and Genet and everyone at American Chiropractic for the wonderful work you do and treatment you provide!
5 The staff at Chandler PT are the best! When I initially came in for my dislocated shoulder, I couldn't lift my arm above my head. With the help and guidance of my primary physical therapist Jennifer and the rest of the team, I have made a full recovery and feel just as good as I did before my injury! Savannah, Jenna, Cris, and Jason we're awesome as well! PT isn't the most exciting thing to have to do, but the staff will make your recovery as fun and successful as it can possibly be.
4 I read the other reviews before going, but being sick on a Saturday left me few options to choose from. I thought all the staff from the front desk to Dr. Forte were extremely pleasant. I didn't have an appointment but I saw the Doctor. in a reasonable amount of time.  Overall I think I will go back if I need to see a Doctor.
4 This is a split review.  And I'd like to preface my review that I have been to many reflexology spas in the Markham/Richmond Hill areas over the years, but none in Scarborough or downtown.  Hence, I benchmark my experience at Footscape against the spas in the Markham/Richmond Hill areas only.  Facility and customer services:  Footscape's decoration, facility upkeep, and spa room cleanliness are top notched among other spas in Markham and Richmond Hill areas.  The colour and lighting and the spaciousness are nice.  The mini food bar with snacks and bottled water is a fine touch.  Customers can grab them on their own.  The reception speaks fluent English, Cantonese and Mandarin.  She is polite, efficient and well presented.  She led me to a treatment room, then offered a bottled water right away.  The greeting and the paying services are smooth.  5 stars for facility and customer services.  The massage:  The skills of a masseuse vary from person to person.  I had a body massage and a foot massage.  The masseuse I had was better at body massages than foot massages.  She was good at telling where I hurt, where most of the pressure points are, and how much force was appropriate to press the pressure points.  Before you say this skills level is expected, I could attest many masseuses on the market only know some of the pressure points.  Some offer a muscle massage at best.  Many don't know how to massage the nerves that run from hips the ankles.  I quite enjoyed the body massage.  Unfortunately, I can't say the same about the foot massage.  I thought she didn't exert enough force.  In addition, she skipped some sore points on my feet.  The massage felt nice, but I didn't have the relaxed, sleepy feeling that I get from a quality foot massage.  4 stars for the body massage, 3 stars for the foot massage.  The average is 3.5 stars.  Obviously, the massage experience is the most important aspect of a massage spa.  You may get a better or worse masseuse than I did.  Plus I really wouldn't mind returning for a body massage from the same masseuse, just not a foot massage.  The prices are on par with other reflexology spas in the Markham/Richmond Hill areas, yet the facility is cleaner.  All things considered, this is a 4-starred spa.
5 Love love love Dr Ehren - he's amazing.  Super knowledgeable, professional, amazing.  Can't say enough good things about AZ Body Mechanics!
5 Dr. Rhett is my personal Doctor of Chiropractic Medicine.  I have known Dr. Rhett for five years and call him a friend as well.  Dr. Rhett's "bedside" manner is exceptional!!  I like this guy and trust him with my Chiropractic needs!  I refer to him whenever the opportunity presents itself!!
5 Our daughter got her arm caught in a closing van door, so with the sudden swelling and pain, we took her in.   The staff was awesome!  Super good at helping our Ava feel better about herself, and they were completely professional and had an awesome bedside manner with our anxious little girl.   X-rays were taken, and Ava actually was fascinated with the process.   Thank you for helping our girl!  You guys were perfect.
1 Went to see Dr. Richardson for a shoulder problem. Very rude Dr. Did not treat my condition at all! I have a rotator cuff tear & he said to go up to Sedona to get a massage! 6 months later still suffering with the pain. He sent me to physical therapy which made the pain even worse, making my hand & arm numb feeling dead.
1 My wife had to see a doctor over the Labor Day weekend so we went to Urgent Care Extra on 8300 W Cheyenne suite 105. We arrived around 11:30 and was seen at 3:30 a wait time of 4HOURS.  The longest wait to see a doctor EVER!  But the staff was okay.  We were then seen by Dr. Mark Witt, what a BIG MISTAKE!  Dr. Mark Witt, was not in his white overcoat so out of uniform and he looked very unkept.  He did not even spend 20 seconds with my wife never asked her even 1 question before given her a prescription.  We asked what could have been the cause of her condition, he gave a general answer.  I had to correct Dr. Mark Witt to were he answered by saying "that is normally the cause ".  We even know that too much sun and/or not drinking enough water can cause my wife's systems. This Dr. Mark Witt is extremely inconsistent and has poor people skills.  Don't waste your time seeing Dr. Mark Witt unless you want below standard service!
1 I don't think this place was very clean at all.  When you walk in it smells really bad and it's seemingly very dirty.   It was chaotic.  The people in the office did not have a clue about anything really and I definitely will not be starting my Baby's child care or learning here.  I took a tour and was not impressed.
5 Had my left knee replaced at age 77.  What a great job Dr. Hadi and his team did with my surgery, which was performed at the Core hospital.  I must give a special thanks to Dr. Hadi's PA David.  Took care of me during my six weeks of recovery.  David encouraged me on every visit answered all my questions regarding my recovery.  The whole team from office staff to techs gets an A+ from me.
5 Fachlich sehr kompetent, keine lange Wartezeiten; nettes Personal, Terminvereinbarung bei anderen Fachärzten häufig durch Dr. Rezutka oder seine Assistentinnen selbst. Schöne, moderne Räume; gute Lage!
5 Just "graduated" from Foothills and I cannot say enough about my experience there. From the moment you will in the door you are made to feel as though your care and wellbeing are their top priority.   The staff is empathetic, thorough and never rushed. Every exercise, treatment and concern is explained. It's weird, but I looked forward to my sessions and seeing everyone. Even those not assigned to your case seem to take  a real interest in your progress.   Thank you, Foothills!
5 Dr petrick is an awesome dr. He helped my pain go from a 10 to a 0 in just 4 visits. I only come back if i have a crick in the neck. Hes certified in Active Release Therapy, which, he thoroughly explained, releases punched nerves by releading the muscle tissue around them. He specializes in sports injuries, but im a professional artist and he helped my cumulative shoulder injury due to drawing. Hes friendly and helpful, and so is the rest of his staff. I never believed that chiropractors were anything but quacks before i met this guy, but someone recommended him and i was in so much agony i thought id try anything. Suprise, suprise, it worked!  The doc explained that most chiropractors dont pay the extra $10 grand to get certified in this therapy, but it works WAY better than traditionsl chiropractic care. Also it works especially well for cumulative injuries (doing the same motions over and over), so if youve got pain, give him a call ! Seriously. What do you have to lose?
1 When I arrived at my first appointment, there were numerous people in the waiting area. I told the front desk that I was paying out of pocket since my insurance didn't cover my physical therapy appointments. The front desk person said that she could not tell me how much my appointments would be. Over the course of several weeks different people worked with me, which was interesting since I had asked to try to work with one because of consistency with the Therapy and so the same person would be familiar with the work towards my progress.  My bills were around $175-$200 for 1 hour. They charged extra for different services like taping a knee, which was $50.   There were so many people working on me that I felt that they didn't have an interest in my care or progress.  Super confusing.  After numerous sessions, I left to find another facility.  I recommend finding a place that will tell you the pricing/rate up front if your insurance doesn't cover!  A friend gave me the name of 2 other physical therapy facilities.  I inquired with both and each gave me a flat rate when I initially called for information. Both are in the Scottsdale area.
5 Love this place!  The atmosphere is so peaceful and relaxing.   It is an easy way to lose inches and tone your body.  I definitely see results from the wraps.  The staff is wonderful as well! Sheryl L.
5 I was hit by a drunk driver that had No Insurance or driver's license and I had 3 back surgeries and I have a spinal cord stimulator implant in my back,  I woke up on Sunday and felt like I had a knife broken off in my lower back,  I then went to Southern Hills Hospital and had a CAT SCAN done and the skinny Asian doctor said there was nothing wrong and sent me home,  I then went to UMC and saw Dr KELLY MORGAN and she show compassion and concern and gave me some trigger point injections and made Sure I felt better before letting me go. Dr Morgan Is The Best Part of UMC.  TY.   Mark Neff
5 Amazing team , helpful , extremely friendly and caring and even try their hardest to work around your schedule. Called the day of and I was at my appointment an hour later.   Highly recommend !
5 Nicht nur zum Kinderkriegen.. auch die Handchirurgie, plastische Chirurgie haben einen sehr guten Ruf. Freundliches Krankenhaus, schöne helle Zimmer mit oftmals schöner Aussicht . Privatversicherte können direkt zu den jeweiligen Sprechstunden.
5 Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall Humpty Dumpty had a great fall if all the king's horses and all the king's men couldn't put Humpty Dumpty together again he should have come to Scottsdale Joint and Spine. Thanks dr. Davis best ever.
1 This place is horrible. After moving here from NY., this is where I went to get a new Dr. through my insurance.  My husband and I took in all our medications and our doctors name and address from New York so they could get out records.  They did not want our previous Dr.'s info and even after giving the doctor our medications we had, she prescribed the wrong dosage for my husband and the wrong medication for me, which I took for a month before noticing.   I was also told that there would be no charge for the visit according to my insurance, she would code it so I would not be charged and insurance would cover it.  I received a bill for over $100.00., of which they still want me to pay.    I guess I am paying for taking the wrong medication in more ways than one.  Now I have to make sure it didn't cause any damage for taking the medication.  Wish I had read all the reviews before I went here.
5 For 5 years I suffered everyday from low back pain and sciatica. At one point I was taking 22 pain pills per day. My Pain Management doctor  recommended Athletica because they work one on one with the patient and are a small facility devoted entirely to the patient. I met Sandi who did the hands-on work and then another therapist who worked with me on an exercise program. All the patients are continually monitored to make sure each exercise is done correctly. The atmosphere is very friendly and comfortable. Sandi always explains what manipulations she is doing and what I should expect the result to be. Sandi explained upfront at my first treatment that my recovery would be a long process, well exceeding my insurance benefits.   I have been pain free for 2 years as Sandi correctly diagnosed the cause of my problem and was able to "fix" it. My pain doctor said it was like a miracle that I was out of pain and based on my great experience at Athletica, he has sent some "tough cases" for pain management to Sandi. I recommend Athletica to anyone looking for a caring facility that will help you recover from chronic back pain, an injury or accident.
1 I made appt for my wife for annual wellness exam and also told receptionist who answered phone that she would need blood work(CBC and lipid panel) . PA Richard Vause did a few perfunctory things and then they asked her if she wanted flu shot and having ears cleaned out for $40. This place is always upselling. When it came time to get blood work they tell her lady who draws blood is on vacation! WTF. Why didnt they tell me that before I made appt since it was for the next day. I asked Vause about this and he wouldnt even look at me. Just said he isnt in charge of scheduling. Receptionist said she didnt do it(it was Gitta) and I could just make another appt or walk across street to Quest and wait another hour. Vause is totally unemotional and uncaring and staff is incompetent. RUN ! RUN ! RUN from this place.
1 So I'm an established patient for 2 years due to a change I made to my health plan. I thought the change would help my family stay healthy. Dr. White is our primary care doc, nice guy. We've also seen Jeanine and Max, both also very nice. Office staff is nice as well. Here's my problem, same day sick is extremely difficult to get in. No one schedules an illness. Well visits are lucky to be made a week in advance, more likely 2 or more. It's fantastic that the office is busy. That means good docs and service. The waiting is crazy though. I got lucky today, there was a cancellation. Needless to say I'll be making a change come open enrollment time.
5 Quick in n out.  Not over the top friendly staff.  But I didn't come here to make friends.   Fast n efficient and got the "job" done.   If you can't see ur pcp and need something fast as I did today. Then this is a clean and nice facility to come and take care of what you need that doesn't require an ER visit
3 This is the fastest walk in clinic I have ever been to, there is never a wait and the staff is very friendly.  However, I can no longer count on them to be open when I need them.  As I am writing this the hours that are posted say that they close at 6 , but there is a sign up that says "due to unforeseen circumstances, the office will be closed at 3pm today".  If this were the first or second time I've ever seen this sign it wouldn't bother me, however it seems to be posted every single time I visit (or at least try to). An hour wait at a different clinic is much easier than the time wasted driving to and from this place, and having to go to the other place anyways.
1 This is the worst place ever! I hate coming here and wouldn't except this is where my employer makes me go for initial visits. They leave you sitting in the lobby for over an hour before that walk you back. Then, you sit in another room by yourself for another hour. Meanwhile, it's obvious that they don't care about time because they will stand out in the main hall talking and chatting each other up.  Urgent Care is HORRIBLE!! Avoid if you can and just go see your own physician.
5 Me and my family have been going to Dr. G. Since he started 1999, he is the best. Staff has always treated us well, rooms are clean.  I have been to plenty of doctors in my 69 years and he is the best. Let's not forget his staff who has changed over the years but all are professional and caring, especially Cindy, she doesn't come out too much anymore it she is awesome.  If you need great family doctor this is the spot. Oh and about me, I ain't easy being a Joisey girl.
5 Hurt my shoulder lifting like an idiot and my doctor recommended Dr. Booth. He's a giant. I'm 6'2 270 and he makes me feel like a midget. With that being said he's dam good at his job and made my shoulder feel brand new.  Dr. Booth is all around cool guy. Best physical therapist in town.
1 I had an appointment for six weeks with Las Vegas Hormonal and Metabolic Clinic and finally it arrived today only to be turned away by his office staff because they didn't accept my Nevada Health Coop insurance. I made three phone calls where their staff assured me that I was covered. I also called NHC twice to make sure that they were a provider. They said you could be a cash patient. One of the office workers ushered me into the hallway when I was on the phone with the insurance company - the bum's rush. Finally I had the insurance company call the office manager because I wasn't going to go away after driving 25 miles and wasting my morning fasting. When I got home I called NHC to get an explanation and they said he hasn't been a provider for them since March 28. Dr. Tice should fire all that were involved. This is after I filled out a ton of paper work. This is the worst doctor experience  of my life. I blame his inept staff and especially the office manager.
5 I have been going to Dr. Briones for about five years now. She is the best doctor in town she will spend two hours with you if that what it takes to help you. She always listens to me and helps with everything. She has even called after hours to make sure I was ok. They no longer make doctors like her. Most doctors you are in and out and never look at you before they say next. I have never waited for more than 15 minutes to see her and as I said she will take her time with you. She definitely makes the world a better place.
1 If you are looking to waste a day then this is the place for you! My doctor sent me in this morning for a simple xray. After waiting in line for 10 minutes at checkin, I was taken to a room and told someone would be right with me. 20 minutes later someone did come in and took my insurance info. The entire time she complained about her boss and having to do 2 new patients in a row (me being one of them). When she was done she told me someone would be right with me. Another lady came in and made me put a gown on and said yet another person would be right with me.  I have been sitting here for 2 hours now and I still have not had an X-ray. I'll be healed by the time they come in!  **update- After 2 hours and 15 minutes I finally found someone outside my room that was able to help me. She said they didn't have any xray patents in line. She entered my room and saw a clip board with all of my info on it. Apparently the lady who was so concerned about complaining about her boss had forgotten to take it and put it somewhere. That's how they know a patient is waiting. Once they discovered this a tech was promptly there and my xray took less than 5 minutes. The tech even said it was too bad what happened to me because she hadn't had a patient in over an hour!  What a joke!
1 Only the most basic care. I need blood drawn every 6 months for thyroid they got that. After that if you get really really really sick & you have to go in on the walk in dr. Pray it's not the female from the baseline office cause she is a joke. Set for 6 hours from early morning so sick was litterly passing out in the chair.. finally get in and she says well you have the flu go home & go to bed I can't help you.   Now I wouldn't be surprised if she wasn't the doctor of one of the kids in Az this year who died from the flu because the doctors sent them home. They took blood for my thyroid test cause I was there & I was so dehydrated it was hard to get blood.   After getting back home and passing  out for about 8 hours my sister in law gave me some of her strong antibiotics and amazing I felt much better in about 6 hours.   Don't go if you really need help. & refuse her if you do go there. she don't do post meno Estrogen  HRT testing, she refuses to do any weight loss help. She is basically useless. I guess if you stub your toe..   I know they say antibiotics don't help with the virus but they do fight off all the secondary infections that come with the virus like lungs & sinus so your body can naturally fight the vurus faster and be stronger to do so.
1 I went here because it's so close to my house.  My symptoms were not complicated, so any clinic would be fine... or so I thought.  I could have just burned $60 & stayed home to sleep.    The doctor spent 2 min. with me, assured me I was fine & sent me home with no medicine.  A week later I was worse.  I ended up going to the Urgent Care on 19th ave & Northern.    Turns out I had bronchitis!  I got on antibiotics, prescribed cough medicine & a decongestant.  I could've started meds days ago & not missed so much work, sleep and life!    Waste of time & money.  I received no help here.
1 Hopefully this will save someone the trouble that I have been going through with this office. I have never written a review before but I have never been so frustrated with a medical office in my life. First of all they take lunch from 11:30 to 1:30 and in that time you have no possibility to leave a message. So if you are trying to take care of something on your lunch period its not going to happen. Then when you do reach someone in the hours that they are open you have to leave a message for someone to call you back ( which is like most offices so I understand that). The kicker is that when they do call you back its about 5 mins before they close so if you miss the call and call back after 4pm then you are out of luck (since you cant leave a message) and then you have to start the process all over again. With that said, if you do reach someone it takes them a good 4-5 days to call you back.. and then when they do call back of course the suggest you come in to the office of course so you can pay another visit to the doc and pay another copay for the office visit.  I left another message for the Dr. over a week ago and as of today have yet to hear back from him or any of the staff. Save yourself the time and frustration of going to this office!!
5 Wow, Laura is incredibly knowledgeable and a fantastic therapist.  I was in so much pain when I went to see her. She went above and beyond to relieve the pain I was in. I have a spinal injury so I have been to a ton of massage therapists and physical therapists. Laura is by far one of the best. Thank you Laura from the bottom of my heart!
5 I can't thank the people here enough for their great work with me. There are too many people to name but my Physical therapist, Mke Peronace, is wonderful. Everyone is supportive, friendly, and caring. I'm fortunate to have chosed this place to finish the recovery from spine surgery.
1 What a joke of a urgent care, never have a real Dr working, always nurse practitioner. My fourth  visit to this location and they dont know how to manage patients who sign in on line, still wait a hour sometimes less. The nurse practitioner prescribed some cough medicine, the insurance did not cover, so I called her and she refused to look in the book to see what medicines this specific medication does cover. At a actual M.D 's office, Ive seen them do this many many times. When you ask for a mild pain reliever they treat you like a drug addict , but yet have access to electronic records to see if you have a history of pain pills and wont give you 5 for PRN, its such a ridiculous establishment! Not only do you get poor care, you get treated like an addict when your truly sick, and you get no medications because, they are always understaffed and untrained people. Do yourself a favor and run as fast as you can from here and go elsewhere , Four times  and same results. Why do I keep going back? Guess Im a fool! The first time, the receptionist talked on her cellphone for 40 minutes.Never ever again. Since, Banner has bought out a bunch of urgent cares they are trash now!
5 Everybody is very friendly  and helpful.  Our  Uncle  Jerry was there for  about 4 weeks following a stroke.  Unfortunately Sante is only a short term care and he had to be moved to a long term care facility.  It will be very difficult for any other nursing care to measure up to the treatment he, and all of  his friends and family received from Sante.  Highly recommended!
5 Quick, efficient and well-priced. You will feel fantastic and it takes less than half an hour.
5 I have had shoulder problems for years now, I went to see PT Matt Schultz at the end of February this guy did a phenomenal job! He was professional, knowledgeable & always positive. During the course of treatment I tore my calf training for a triathlon. Well, Needless to say with proper treatment I am competing in my first cycling race of the year on April 11 El Tour De Mesa & Good to go for my first ever Ironman later this year! Thank you Matt, Shayla & the entire 360 Staff!
5 I take my baby to see Dr York. Although he looks young (mid 30's?) he is an awesome doctor and knows what he's doing. I always book the first appointment of the day if possible as they do have about 6 doctors on staff so the rooms do fill up quick in the middle of the day. The one late appointment I had to make after work only resulted in a 20 min wait in the waiting room. They play childrens movies on the tv's in the waiting room and have a childrens toy for the toddlers to stand around and mess with. If you do have a medical question for the doctor you do have to leave a voice mail and they return your call within 24 hours. If I call in early enough in the morning I usually get a response that day.   I highly recommend this office.   Parking sucks, but the office has no control over that as its on hospital grounds.
4 Dr Adams has been my MD for so many years. Love her cause you know she genuinely cares and takes time with her patients. The longest wait time I've waited to see her was, maybe, 3 hours. Still worth it, but I know it took a lot of my time, instead of me being productive. I wish they have the text approach where you receive an alert letting you know that you're next.  I'm also not happy with the lady in front, Melinda (believe is her name). She sent out my mom's referrals to facilities that doesn't take her insurance . When I called to inquire, she was rude and made it sound like I'm attacking her over the phone. Then later asked me to just PICK UP my mom's referral and do it myself LOL. Later on, I found out that my mom's insurance--HPN--goes with SOUTHWEST MEDICAL ASSOCIATES ONLY, which clearly, MELINDA has no idea about. Other than that, everyone else is amazing, especially Carly and Kelly!  I've switched my mom to a new pcp recently, ONLY because she wants a Filipino doctor who she would be able to speak Tagalog to freely. It was a HUGE mistake. The new doctor, MARIA ADOLFO, was a horrible one, just horrible horrible.  I just hope they do something to improve and resolve about the waiting time and SOMEONE CHECKING THEIR VOICEMAILS! I couldn't get a hold of anyone to setup an appt. Most often, it's their voicemail I'm talking to and no one calling me back. I have been charged a NO SHOW FEE, when I ACTUALLY called in to cancel. Of course, I left a voicemail because no one picked up. Still no one has returned my call.  Staff needs a lot of improvement.
5 We have been seeing Dr Reed for 9 years and recommend him highly. He is a great listener and very knowledgeable.  He also has great referrals if needed.
1 yelp felt the need to remove my comment about this establishment. and I say it again "I would rather DIE on the street than be taken to this hospital". I was a patient here for the birth of my daughter and it was the most emotionally and physically scarring moment in my life but I didn't want to discuss that and the statement I made was enough to suffice how I felt about it my comment blatantly addressed the core of my customer experience but yelp felt the need for me to relive that horrible moment. thanks yelp and umc
5 Dr. Jenni and her staff are amazing.   I hadn't been to a Chiropractor in 10 years and wow I needed to get back to it.  I have one messed up back.    Dr. Jenni and her staff do a great job of treating you as a real patient not just another $ walking through the door.    For anyone looking for a Chiropractor I would totally recommend AFC.
5 I absolutely loved this place!  When I found out I was pregnant I had a very hard time finding the right doctor.  I wanted a more natural/holistic approach to my care that is really hard to find these days.  It was like a dream come true when I found this place, and found that they took my insurance!  I set up my initial visit to meet the doctor and was sold. I absolutely loved the atmosphere and that they really respect your wishes as far as how you are medically treated.  The appointments were all quick and informative.  If there was something I had a question about or was concerned about they would explain the best they could and then also give me resources that I could look into on my own.  I really enjoyed all of my visits at the office.  My only complaint was that Dr. Brass Jones was so busy that scheduling was a little difficult sometimes, but they were pretty flexible and it ended up working out great. I gave them a copy of my birth plan and they immediately sent it over to the hospital and they stuck to it 100%.  They did not try to talk me out of anything or try to convince me to do things differently.  They were very supportive of my wishes.  while at the hospital the delivery went very smoothly.  Dr Brass Jones was wonderful. Follow up was just as nice.  They really cared how I was doing and answered all of my questions.   I am not a fan of doctors, but I really like the approach this whole center takes.  They really know what they are doing.  I like that their first recommendations are more natural instead of just giving you drugs and  I like that they offer other services as well.  If I ever hear anyone looking for a more natural approach to their pregnancy I cannot say enough good things about this place.  Mary Anne and Dr. Brass Jones are wonderful.
4 My first visit there was very very good, so decided to switch my primary care there, then my second visit also went well, i like that you can be a walk-in, and without a very long wait, my third time there went rather slow and i sort of felt like they blew me off a little, but i got my referral to eye doctor so im pleased...OVERALL ITS A GREAT PLACE TO GO!
4 Was looking for a Dr for my annual check and didnt have anyone so I chose these guys because of the proximity to work. Decent experience, had same day appointment and didnt have to wait long first time in for a physical. Second time in had to wait an hour because of an emergency, not in their control I assume. I do feel like it is more of an Urgent Care.   I gave them a 4 for now as I wait for labs and follow-up from the office. I have a sub-Dr and not Williams.
5 Been seeing Dr Richards, very professional, always gets me in right when I arrive or shortly after. The whole center has been fabulous.
1 I had really high hopes for this office, I was referred here by a coworker who spoke very highly of it. However, as a lot of these other reviews have mentioned, they are terrible at answering their phones, their customer service is not good, and they always run late.   I went in three separate times hoping that I would get good results, but each time I was called back 30 minutes after my scheduled appointment time in addition to having to wait another 15-20 minutes for the doctor to actually see me.   The doctor I saw is very sweet and caring, however the level of care that she gave me I was not satisfied with resulting in several follow up appointments to treat something that should have been taken care of with only one visit. Needless to say I am very disappointed.
5 I showed up as a walk-in for just one morning in February.  The lady was very nice and helped me with the mat and towel I hadn't brought.  Everyone seemed a bit reserved but still welcoming.   We were packed a bit tight but, from the comments I overheard, that doesn't seem to often be the case. I think hot yoga is a crazy concept / form of punishment but, as far as the people and facilities at Sumit's, it was very nice.  They had a changing room and I think they also had a shower - would be convenient to go straight into work if you were a regular. My phone mapping app didn't quite get me there.  Close enough but had to go to the back of that mall, close to the Whole Foods or health food store.  Side note: If you are visiting Phoenix, trying to get to Taliesin, do NOT trust your phone mapping apps!  Print something ahead of time!
5 The minute you walk in the door, you know you are in a great place.  Front desk staff are incredibly kind and helpful. State of the art check in process allows for you to define your individual needs for the visit.  Talk about a team approach to total body care - you meet with everyone on the staff and clearly understand how each person will help in your healing process.  Dr. Meyers is kind, she is comprehensive in her approach. She clearly explains everything and how all pains connect. She very obviously cares about her patients and best of all, no drugs!  If you want a natural, comprehensive, team approach to addressing your pain, look no further than Dr. Meyers and her team!
5 I have been going to Alpha Chiropractic for the past 3 years after I was referred to them through Team in Training.  I had just completed my first half marathon and my podiatrist told me that my plantar fasciitis was so bad that I should never do another race.  My coach recommended I go and see Dr. Robertson and after extensive treatment on my feet (because I let it go too long), I no longer experience any pain and have very rare flare ups that require one visit to fix up.  I am headed into my 13th half marathon and would not still be having fun raising money and awareness for blood cancer research while putting notches on the race belt if it weren't for Dr. Robertson and his staff.  I would recommend them to anyone and have continued to do so.  Thanks for fixing my feet!!
5 I highly recommend HealthSource chandler for PT and Chiropractic.  Patty, Dr David AND all the staff are very caring and helpful. They help with your nutrition along with your pains. We love it here
5 Dr Chris Robey is phenomenal.   My back was in a lot of pain when I first saw him.  After one visit my mobility increased tremendously.  I could walk and move around again.  I recommend this office to anyone who is in a lot of pain.  Thank you.
1 This place changes doctors all the time. If you like to see the same doctor do NOT come to this place. I've been going to this office for years, it used to go under the name of Ahwatukee Primary Care. They switched to this East Valley Family Medical and boy what a screw up! I've given more money to this office than I should have. Its a total scam. Want a prescription refilled after you've seen a doc and its been a couple of months, NOPE. No one in the office can read that I have an acute issue and can't go with out my meds. Do I have to see the doc every month to get refills? Apparently! and this is where the scam comes in. They charge your insurance a boat load just for an office visit to get a script refilled. I even know that they fired their nurse for being overweight. The waiting room is a wreck and filthy. Im so glad I was able to find another doctor who actually cares about their patients. Seems they are making more money as a weight loss clinic than a family care office. STAY CLEAR.
2 Doctor and MA's were nice and helped with exactly what I needed. And I was able to make a same day appointment. However! The wait was way too long!! It was unbelievable.
5 I cannot say thank you enough to all of the staff and for the care that they provided to my grandmother. Her stay far exceeded my expectations from the excellent food to all the kind and compassionate clinical staff members that cared for her after her procedure. I am so thankful for finding the right place for my loved one.
1 Very unhappy with the treatment that I received. Dr. Ruddell prides himself on getting people in and out quickly and that it exactly what he does. He seems more interested in talking than actually trying to heal. Muscle testing is just not done. I continually had to remind him of to work on a body part that he seemly just forgot. I am extremely disappoint and feel that I have wasted valuable time and money. This was further confirmed when I switched chiropractors. The service and help I am now receiving is world's apart.
5 As a longtime long distance runner, I'm used to my fair share of minor pulls and injuries. Two months ago I had a sharp pain near my groin, but it wasn't a groin pull - rest, ice, foam rolling, nothing was working. Thanks to Sole Sports who referred me to Dr. Tom at the Doctors of Physical Therapy. Dr. Tom immediately diagnosed that I had misaligned my pelvis, and we started a series of stretches and exercises designed to keep it in place and strengthen the surrounding muscles. Over the course of four more visits, I made significant progress each time, and last week was able to go run two hours ago, 100% pain free before, during, and after. Two months ago I couldn't run for 60 seconds without sharp pain. I should also add, Dr. Tom was great in being communicative in between sessions - he always took my calls/emails with any questions I had and helped out with minor adjustments, which can make all the difference. If I ever have PT needs again, I'll be headed to The Doctors of Physical Therapy!
1 Very poor customer service. Incredibly long wait times. Avoid Scottsdale Healthcare.
5 $25 Massages all September, sign me up!   Had a massage here 2 weeks ago.  I actually found the staff to be professional and inviting.  My massage therapist was great, she did say she was brand new at this location, but had been a massage therapist for 5 years.    I asked for a relaxing massage and that is what I got...all 50 minutes of it!
1 Scheduled appointment and still had to wait 2 hours in pain. Horrible place should hire more people.
5 I have to say its so hard to find ppl with passion for their careers and compassion for their customers. You can tell when you walk into that building they DNT want to just see you leave feeling a lil better physically but they are just up lifting happy ppl and i couldnt have asked for such a better experience. Dr.Horton is the sh*!# he really really helped me out when my first law firm dropped my case .. HE ACTUALLY HELPED ME FIND OTHER LAWYERS. He pulled so many strings for me and did so much i cant even begin to name all the nice dedicated loyal  things this office has done for me!!!!! They definitely need to be the #1 chiropractic office of 2016! Oh! Theyll see me again cause im going to be stoppin in all the time just to bug em. lol! Like i dont even know what to say anymore cause its so indescribable how damn awesome these guys really are!!! Its just really NICE to see that charismatic perfection in customer service again. YOU GUYS ROCK THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR EVERYTHING YOU HAVE DONE FOR ME AND STILL HAVE OFFERED TO DO YOU GUYS ARE GREAT !!!! I KNOW I WASNT THE MOST PUNCUAL AND/OR EASIEST CUSTOMER THAT JUST CAME AND WENT BUT HEY IT WAS FUN! Still planning on coming back in to see you guys hopefully soon. xo BEST GROUP OF PPL I KNOW .
5 You know some times when you're walking down the street, then slip-CRAA-AACK-bang, you're on the ground and your ankle hurts like crazy?   I came here to get my super sprained ankle checked out a few weeks ago. I had absolutely ruined it in August, and by the beginning of September, it was still pretty sore.  I saw Chris, a physiotherapist. He assessed my injury and I saw him twice a week for a few weeks. He did some localized massage and an ultrasound treatment for every visit. After the first two weeks, I felt a LOT better, with much of my range of motion restored. I was able to get back into my normal workout routine, though with less intensity. He then coached me on some stretches and exercises to do to strengthen my apparently weak side-leg muscles so I won't continue to sprain it. After the third week, I was healed enough to take the Tough Mudder challenge, and finished with zero ankle pain, but a bit of knee pain, due to my body overcompensating for the bad ankle these past few weeks.  I saw him the Monday following and he noticed that my knees were in pain because of my hilariously terrible balance, due to weak inner thigh muscles. He then gave me some stretches and exercises to do to bump up my crazy weak muscles that were apparently contributing to a case of Runner's Knee.   All in all, I'm super impressed with the quality of care here, the quality of customer service and the location. There's validated parking in the basement and it's right above a subway station. I couldn't recommend this place more!
1 We walked in and the receptionist was very negative, rude, and unprofessional.  We waited 3 hours to be seen by the doctor for him to turn my brother away, who is a stage 4 cancer patient that was in need of an emergency pill refill. The doctor was rude, uncompassionate and unwilling to help. I will never go back to any md now location.
1 I have never been so disgusted and angry as I am with the way some of these nurses are taking care of my mother in law. When you ask them a question, they don't have an answer. One nurse tried 10 times (65 minutes) to put in a midline catheter in her arm, and then when she started crying was told to shut up. How can some shut up when they can't even talk!! There's a frigging tube in her throat!!! It took 45 minutes from the time it was reported that she needed to be changed to the time a nurse came into to clean her up. DO NOT LEAVE your loved ones alone, always have someone in the room with them.
1 Do not see Dr. Mohajer if you require pain meds to manage your pain. Dr Mohajer will cut your meds immediately and push you to use weed and to buy it from one of two dispensaries that he is a part owner of. Talk about a conflict of interest! Dr Mohajer is one of the most uncaring doctors I have ever seen and that's saying a lot because a lot of pain management doctors are terrible in Las Vegas.
2 I've been coming here for a few years after going to other doctors in the West Valley. There are a few doctors and NP's that are really great, and actually really helpful. They moved to a larger office which is nice and clean.  But the wait. This appointment I waited over an hour after my appointment time to see the doctor. The two times before this the wait was about 45 minutes. I understand running a little bit behind, but this is getting really frustrating.
1 I have been going to Dr. Adam's since 2007. She is amazing, BUT as of Monday 1/30/2017 I will b finding another dr. Due to her staff!!! I again had to ask for new referrals n the same ones refaxed for a 3rd month now. I had a VERY IMPORTANT  DR. appt I made n had to wait to get in to for months call n cancel cause they called n faxed over 4 days n no response from dr. Adam's office. I have lupus, fibro and chronic pain, now my daughter has a postive ana n has been referred to a RA which she will have to wait 8 or more months to get in n they still haven't received  the referral to even make the appt. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE!!!!! this my health and my daughters health being affected. I guess another visit Monday morning to talk to Dr. Adam's personally  about her staff!!! And on top of these issues is the 3 plus hours that u have to wait!!!!
5 I went to see Mark for an issue with a tight and cramping calf. It was so bad that I couldn't run and I kept waking up with excruciating pain. He quickly diagnosed the problem as stemming from my hip-which really surprised me. I had therapy on my hip and leg and the issue cleared up within a week. They saw me right away unlike other places where you have to wait forever to get an appointment. I've since gone back for a shoulder issue and Mark fixed that too. I highly recommend Mark and Landmark Physical Therapy.
5 I love this office, I wasn't happy doing physical therapy before but when I started going here I end up finding that is not bad at all, the staff are fun and great helping me to feel better. I'm so happy that I decide to give a second shot to physical therapy because I can see the improvement I got since I started also I started looking forward to go to my sessions every time because it's an enjoyable time. I recommend to all my friends if they ask me about it. I normally don't like to write reviews, just if I don't like the place but I fell like they really deserve a review, I love to go there.
5 I go to Dr Forte for cosmetic fillers and she is caring , thoughtful and always on the cautious side . I never even bruise , (I went to an important business luncheon the very next day , and I looked fine. Her staff was extremely polite,SO i am confused at those other reviews. I truly believe some people's expectations are ridiculous. So before someone writes something unkind, please remember she is only human. She is a hardworking doctor that cares about her patients.
1 I arrived for an emergency but I didn't have my insurance number printed out. I insisted it was an EMERGENCY and all I got from the attendant was: "I'm sorry".  I could barely stand... futhermore I was going to pay in cash for the medical attendance and I already had the authorization code from the insurance. A total lack of human respect.
5 We absolutely LOVE Great Destinations!!! They are amazing and have helped our little guy sooo much!!! Kudos to this wonderful staff!!!!
4 4 stars for my first visit.  I'm sure my rating will change to 5 as I keep going here.  The staff is friendly, and the wait wasn't long at all probably no more than 5 minutes.  The waiting room had a TV playing a kid-friendly movie on repeat, and decent amount of seating, though I'm hoping they'll upgrade from small plastic chairs to ones with cushions.  I was pretty reluctant to sit on the couch, as the term "fomite" from another review rung in my head.  (Seriously, look that up, and tell me that doesn't make you think of every chair or couch in any waiting area).  My appointment time was at 5pm, and I had used ZocDoc to get all of my new patient paperwork in.  They'll still ask you questions when you get in as a new patient, but it didn't bother me; I'd rather be asked again and feel that they're genuinely concerned about my health.  I was seen by Dr. Baoan Andy Le that day.  Excellent mannerism, seemed to really care that I wasn't feeling well, and actually pointed out something I hadn't even considered was a health problem.  Luckily, it was something that could also be tested for during a lab I needed to get.  The clinic is a little far from where I live, but I'd go far for a doctor that I felt comfortable being seen by.  My only complaint would be... the bathroom!  The switch is for the lights and fan, and that thing is Super Loud!  Don't let that put you off from going here, though.
1 If I could give them a lower rating, I would. They do not return calls, you cannot speak with a manager, the front desk staff is immature and talk and laugh inappropriately about patients or their social lives, loud enough that anyone in the waiting room can hear. I went in for a serious medical situation and they sent me out without doing anything for me. I had a fever and that wasn't even addressed. They read my lab results to me, forgetting important information and calling 10 days later to say they missed it, although they called about one issue they still overlooked the most important issue. I ended up getting a second opinion and had to have a biopsy done. I think that's a pretty big deal to overlook. They refuse to give you a copy of your own lab/test results. It felt completely impersonal, I needed help and all they cared about was getting me in and out the door without caring about my health. They overcharged me, and lied about things in my report for what they did for me. I would suggest going anywhere else, and not wasting your time and money on a place that doesn't care about your time or safety.
5 Experts in pelvic floor rehabilitation, an invaluable service. Also knowledgeable in other injury recovery and wellness services including weight loss, massage and MFR. Visiting OptimaLiving Therapy and Wellness is so relaxing, afterwards I feel like I've been to the spa. Highly recommended!
1 I could not be more disappointed with this care facility.  I saw Dr. Vojvodic.  We had such a pleasant interaction, not, that at the end of our appointment, she said, "you can go."  lol  like I was a child.  at least she said she wouldn't bill me for the visit, which was absolutely pointless!  the director of the facility called me after and wanted to understand the situation, which was nice, and offered that Dr. Vojvodic was willing to be my primary care physician if I was interested.  Really???  I expressed that if this was really the case, then Dr. Vojvodic should have had the audacity to call me back, and not someone else.  In reality, the phone call seemed as a way to smooth things over so I wouldn't leave a negative review about the practice.  If I am mistaken, and Dr Vojvodic really is apologetic, I wait for her call and I will modify this review.  However, I shall not hold my breath.  In addition to this, the facility was sub-par in my opinion.  I would definitely find another doctor.
5 I can't believe how genuinely nice Dr Sharma is. He never rushed me. He will explain everything in plain English and he is a very good listener. He is empathic and very down to earth. What a good and nice doctor he is. Other doctors should follow his example. He even gave me a medication discount card to help me out. THANK YOU DOCTOR SHARMA. YOU MADE MY DAY TODAY.
5 They have moved to Pecos and Wigwam. Love my therapists. Been seeing them for a couple of months now following my shoulder surgery. Everyone from the PT assistants (love you Chris) to the PTA Matt, to every single therapist is knowledgable, professionals, and caring.  Wouldn't go anywhere else!
5 For the first time in years I am finally without pain. The entire staff is caring and takes thier time to make certain you are receiving the care and attention you need in effort to get you better. It is apparent your health and treatment matters to each one of them.  So grateful to finally feel better!
5 Very good care provided by very nice people. Cuttita was recommended to me by a friend who visited for pregnancy-related issues, though I initially went following a mild traumatic brain injury. He was ethical enough to refuse to treat me until neurologists cleared me for chiropractic work. Once healthy enough to visit, within a couple weeks of treatment you could actually see a difference in the alignment of my spine! I'm very happy with the care I've received there.
5 A Las Vegas Medical Group is a great family and pediatrician medical practice facility. My primary Dr. Jacqueline Leventhal is very thorough. I always brag about her to all of my family and friends and highly recommend her because she's honest, she cares about her patients and checks you for everything. I was so impressed by her and the friendly staff I even  switched my kids pediatrician over and now they see Dr. Elizabeth Green who is also great! Thanks!
5 Very nice staff. Clean and modern decor. I believe they take all insurances. Dr Hanks has a great bedside manner.
5 The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. It's a great environment for physical therapy.
2 I went to this clinic to get some refills on a prescription and since the office was empty, I thought I might investigate the cause of my crackling kneecap.    When I got there, the place was virtually deserted; but I liked that.  After waiting in the examination room I realized why.  I heard the doctor (young korean man) advising his elderly patients that they should ask their pharmacist all of the questions they were asking him... excuse me, YOU'RE the doctor.  I heard him tell them, that if they were taking "these medications with these other medications and these other ones" there  would probably be some kind of reaction.  DUH. That's why they're there. That's why they brought you all their medications.    So anyway, he came in and prescribed my refill and then I asked about my knee.  He didn't really care to hear what the problem was, he just said, "what exactly are you expecting me to do about it?" I said, I dunno, recommend some exercises or tell me if it sounds normal or if I should see a REAL doctor for it. SOMETHING! He then wrote me an X-Ray form and I haven't seen him since... What's the point? I'll save a token and just go ask a pharmacist.  2 lack lustre stars.
5 Prior to see Garret Bruno, PT, DPT at Arizona Manual Therapy Centers, I had been experiencing daily low back and leg pain for over 3 years. I'd seen multiple orthopedists and was prescribed various medications, but never experienced lasting relief. Eventually, I became convinced I would always have to deal with this pain, so I was hesitant to even try physical therapy. Garret was quick to identify the underlying issues at the root of my chronic pain, and he offered practical solutions for my problem, without medication. He was able to relieve my pain with gentle manual therapy techniques, as well as teach me a simple home exercise program to keep me pain-free. Weeks have passed since I first met with Garret, and my symptoms have not returned. I couldn't be happier to say that Garret has helped me when I didn't think there was anything that could be done.
5 Professional from the moment you walk in. I could recommend them any higher;  Jonathon Seiberg and the staff were helpful, kind and efficient.
1 Eaton was the only good thing they had going for them.  Now that she is gone, I am in search of a new doctor.  Also, I visited the clinic in June due to being sick, and missed a necessary work appointment.  Now I have to get a form filled out stating that I was at the office for medical reasons so that I am not penalized at work.  with Erica gone, they want me to PAY TO COME BACK IN in order to fill out my form stating that I visited them in June.  Bunch of money making bull in my opinion.
1 HORRIBLE, TERRIBLE, ABSOLUTELY THE WORST EVER!!!!! I've been an unfortunate patient to this facility since 1-01-16 and this is by far the most inept office ever. When I call I am put on hold for an average of 15 minutes or more and then they are notorious for just hanging up on you anyway after you have waited all this time.  If you leave your phone number so that you can be called back they don't return these calls as they say they will. Most of the time if you actually reach a person then it's their operator and she just takes a message and nothing comes of that either. I have been trying for almost a month now to get two referrals and when a man from the referral department, Brian finally gave these to me the referrals were no good as the provider didn't accept my insurance. So then Brian doesn't want to be bothered with me anymore so he sends my request for referral off to another worker, Janis in that department and I haven't heard back from her either. Today I went in person to their office to talk to someone in the referrals and I found that that is the only way to get anything accomplished as they can't hang up on you and tomorrow I will go back to their office to see if they have my referrals and I am going to try to talk with Dr. Hughes and make him aware of how poorly his office is being ran.  I don't think these doctors know how broken their office and referral department is.. I would change providers but can't now as I am paid up till the last day of Dec 2016 and then I will get new insurance with the new year and I will be so happy to be done with Md 24 House calls.  Do yourself a favor and find a different provider if you can.
1 I was warned that I would be disappointed with this family practice and unfortunately I was. I will never visit this office again, they are rude, unprofessional, and the doctor does not listen to your concerns.
5 We've gone to the one on Windmill and the one on Wigwam. Great patient care. Very nice people.
5 Valley Physical Therapy is well run, with a convenient location near route 51 and Bell, nice facility and equipment and EXCELLENT staff.  I highly recommend Megan as an outstanding physical therapist.  I first found her when she was working for another company 5 years ago, and her massages and exercise routine cured my hip and knee problems (no surgery or cortisone injections needed because of her).  I then followed her to this company, where she is working on foot problems for me, and has already made progress with my condition.  She is gentle, never hurts, but diligent in pushing me where needed.   It is easy to get appointments scheduled, and I have never had to wait more than 5 minutes.  When Megan was home from work one time, the owner, Julie, filled in for her so I did not miss a session.   All in all, Valley Physical Therapy is the ultimate in personal TLC and expertise.
1 grungy, gross, depressing atmosphere at this office.  dr licata was very short, impersonal, and unnecessarily rude during the entire consult.  i will never ever consider a return visit to this office.
5 Love this place! It's such a warm loving atmosphere. I always feel like I am their only customer and let me tell you I am not. The place is always busy but they take the time to make sure I am having a great experience.  They offer infrared body wraps, reiki healing, organic teeth whitening , facials plus more.  Iso far I have only had the body wraps and I love it so much I want to make it my weekly routine. Julie is the best. She is very sweet and truly cares about her clients.  The studio offers great deals too!  I highly recommend this healing beauty spot.
5 I was getting ready to do my first International triathlon and 2 weeks before, I was having bad knee pain. I called Eric and he got me in that afternoon and after 2 treatments I was able to compete and finish pain free. I will definitely go back if any issues come up.
4 I have received exceptional care from Wendy Martinez.  I have tried several doctors and nurse practitioners. She has given me her undivided attention and truly listened to my concerns about my health. However the phone waits can sometimes be impossible or not answered at all which I find unprofessional. However since I've been there several times and received such great care from her I would and will continue to recommend forte family Cheyenne.
5 My wife and I and 4 year old twins have been patients of Dr. Tognacci for over 5 years. He is busy but he always finds a way to squeeze us in to see him, instead of making us wait like other doctors. He and his staff always take the time to listen and his diagnosis are always right on.  My wife is really demanding so if he can keep her happy that is saying a lot.  I would recommend Dr. Tognacci and his NP to anyone.
5 Special thanks to Dustin and the other physical therapists, PTA's, and office staff who treated me over the past 7 months, post automobile accident.  I've had too many visits to count but know my recovery has gone well because of the knowledgable staff at Select PT.  The words "thank you" are not enough to express my gratitude to them.  I was treated so well!
5 Came here today after seeing the high review. Even though I usually don't go by just two reviews I decided to try anyways since it wasn't too far.  Wow! Came in, no wait, the doctor asked a ton of questions and didn't rush or made me feel rushed. Inside is very clean, and the front desk staff is friendly.   Found a new doctors office myself and my girlfriend. Worth the drive and even if it is a longer drive for you, you'll make it back on with the short waiting time.
1 Poor customer service specially from their office manager Darlene. She was rude and unprofessional UNTIL she received my card information. For someone who works in the medical field, her compassion for others doesn't exist. This practice only wants your money and will do anything to get it. Including reported your missed appointment fee of $35.00 (planned a month in advance with NO reminder from the office) to the medical debt board.   If they were the last doctor office in state, I'd travel out of state.
5 I could not have asked for a better experience. I have been looking for a new primary care physician for a couple of months. This place was more than accommodating, got me an appointment within 24 hours, the front desk answered my numerous questions, and did so with a very pleasant and friendly personality. I saw a physician's assistant named Nicole. She spent more than adequate time with me, made me feel so comfortable. I know that this is the place that will have my well being in all aspects of my life as their primary concern. I for sure will be going back to this very friendly very professional very accommodating office. Highly recommended.
1 Good doctor horrible office, bad communication between the doctor and the staff, They made my husband go and pay twice for a doctor visit and still not have the prescription send to the pharmacy . have been calling the doctor more than 10 times he doesn't get a call back from the anybody at that office  and they said that is going to need to set another doctors appointment to get his prescription fill .
3 Very friendly atmosphere and very through therapists. The only complaint I have is their lack of guidance/plan setting for the patient. Perhaps that is part of the plan but it is the main complaint I had. In addition, they are not very persistent with  booking appointments.
5 This is the right kind of atmosphere for a home health care office.  Everyone is always smiling and friendly.  Considering what those folks have to deal with on a daily basis in the home health care field, the nurses always seem to be having a great time.  A huge part of healing is preventing sadness from creeping up on you, and these folks seem to be experts at that ... and they really know their medicine too!  I tend to think that those "top place to work" awards are phony, but I bet these guys earned that award.
1 My husband was very pleased with Erica Eaton PA.  Been a few times back and he's doing well. ***Update She no longer works there. service is not the same :(
1 When going to this office do not expect a welcome reception from the Medical Assistants that work there. They are cold, indifferent, and very aloof toward patients. The Drs are great but customer service needs improvement immensely. I agree with previous comment that professionals do not exist at this front office.
5 A nice and modern health care facility.  Refreshing and courteous staff (the ones I've encountered).  Hopefully you don't need the hospital, not a bad one if you do!
5 Gilbert Family Medicine is an outstanding practice.  I was in Gilbert for a conference and developed some trigger points in my neck and right trap.  I was able to get an appointment ASAP and they treated me like a VIP.  I even received a call from the chiropractor while at dinner after my adjustment to check in on me.  If you want outstanding service and treatment then you have found the right place.
5 I had a recent flare up of sciatica and despite a couple visits to my regular chiropractor, I had been researching other options and came across the Joint on my Yelp app.   I heard about them on the radio and they are indeed your  "Massage Envy" type setup. I was particularly happy because they are open at this location until 4pm on Saturdays and I was urgently seeking some more relief due to the pain in my lower back. I managed to get in around 3 and was very thankful for it. I had Dr. Hornback who seems to only be there on weekends but for the into price of $19 I got one of the best adjustements I can remember and he also gave me some suggestions and a brief overview of my tension points.   I may be wary still of getting into monthly contracts but for those of you who are seeking frequent adjustments or often have back pain, the setting is relaxed and professional, service is friendly and helpful and at a great price especially wih the packages they offer. Look forward to going to them again if the need arises.
1 I wonder who are the people running this business? This should be a public service. Travelling to other countries is a serious medical and social issue; can be a matter of life and death. The person I spoke with over the phone is very rude. She was like: it's $59, blah blah blah ... , I inquired further, and she was like: Sir, we are very busy, would you like to get vaccinated or not? They should subcontract reception to call centres that are knowledgeable and courteous enough to explain procedures and the importance of vaccines and not sound like fly by night dealership.
5 Dr Alia is so kind and always listens!! He is very professional while being personable. He has been our family Dr for years now and I hope for years to come.
1 Stay away from this place.  They should rename It, Banner Urgent Carelessness.  The office staff has no knowledge of what is going on in this small facility.  I was told there is no direct management on-site and only a manager who oversees numerous locations. Their equipment is not operational which requires them to refer you out for costly tests.  The provider AKA the Physician's Assistant make a diagnosis on a patient before performing an examination...yes this actually happened.  I don't know if this problem is isolated to this location due to its rural location or if it is a systemic problem from Banner itself.
1 Dr Irene is okay, her new staff sucks.  Especially, Leslie, rude and unprofessional. She kept saying "No problem". Hey, in my world ., if its a problem, i'll go somewhere else.  Old staff was okay.
5 I cannot speak for all the therapists at 360PT but I worked with several; Mark was my primary.  When I started going I was in a wheelchair, short distances on crutches, in an external fixator (lower left leg), and allowed to walk in a pool, chest deep.   I started with the aquatherapy and took my first crutchless steps in months in the pool.  The aquatherapists were incredibly supportive when I tried, increased my exercises when I felt strong and were understanding when I became frustrated. I became approved to use crutches more often and Mark helped me to do that on dry land.  He 'walked' me through first using one crutch then using none. Mark never treated me like a child or worked 'down' to me: when I needed to ease it back he did and when I could do more he helped me work more.  He treated me with great respect. After PT I was sore.  During Mark's torturous manipulations of my foot (the muscles had beef jerkied while my foot was locked in that terrible fixator) I was in pain.  He never said he was proud of me or really vocally encouraging in any way.  He showed me, by smiling and laughing  when I surprised myself at my progress on the easier exercises, how far I had come and in many ways Mr. Miyagi-ed me into walking and allowing me to see and experience my own progress.  Mark was the best kind of coach for me, although the 'massages' were definitely painful. There may be a better PT but this one, and Mark, helped me walk again.    *side note: the referral bonus for referring my brother went to my brother! C'mon, 360PT.
1 Don't do it. Too many inconveniences and setbacks. Never have I ever in my (well I've only been alive 20 years) have been to a place so unorganized. They gave me the wrong xrays two times both times instructed by the Doctors. Wasted a lot of time and gas and energy. Been trying to get surgery scheduled for 2 months and still nothing to this day. Stay away!!!!
5 Dr. Dye takes the time necessary to understand your physical condition and then explain the treatment in simple yet comprehensive terms. He has helped me immensely with both cervical neck and lower back disc issues. As an added bonus I leave his office with a mental uplift and a smile from he and his staff's genuinely caring, friendly, positive and humorous attitude and demeanor!
1 I am highly disappointed in the Dr. Yee and the practice. Like many here, I believe Dr. Yee to be a superior physician, who cares about her patients. However, the office staff is horrible. In October, I called three times a day - morning, mid-day, afternoon for 10 straight business days. No one answered the phone and it went to voicemail. I left a message asking...begging for someone to return my call because I was running low on medication. Finally someone answered. I had previously needed an authorization for a medication that took months to receive from insurance. When it finally came through they attempted to call me on a telephone number I no longer had. When I asked what address they had on file, they had an address from 2013 when I moved from Las Vegas. My information was not updated upon my return to Dr. Yee's office. On 01/24/2017, I called to confirm an appointment for February. The appointment was looked up by my birthdate and confirmed. The next day when I called to reschedule, I was informed I was no longer a patient. DR. YEE HAD APPARENTLY FIRED ME AS HER PATIENT. I understand, I can be hot headed and a little witchy, but the office staff doesn't take any responsibility in the issue. When I questioned on 01/25/2017, why I was not informed of this in NOVEMBER when it occurred, they said they mailed me a letter. However when I called on Monday, 01/09/2017 and begged for an emergency appointment, as I would be out of town unexpectedly and would run out of medicine - I was told they could not see me. I was not told there was a banner on my account, because I spoke with a medical student, that indicated I was no longer a patient. It really sucks, because now that I am down to my last week of pills, with zero remaining refills - I have to go find a doctor, because again, the office staff who in three phone calls couldn't tell me I was fired as a patient. I think it's mighty convenient for them, that it just so happened the day I called to reschedule. Later the same day on 01/25/2017 when I called back to get the name of a medicine for the authorization, because it was different and I hadn't taken it before I was told, "You can call your insurance." And then hung up on! I deal with witchy customers all day long, but at the end of the day they pay my bills and this is not something lightly. This is my health care. If you are a patient or considering being a patient - plan a 2-4 hour window for a single visit. Very disappointed.
5 In 2009 I blew out my ACL playing football and also tore my meniscus and cracked my kneecap in the process. It was a horrible injury. I basically had to learn how to walk again. Rich was my PT and he was excellent. Experienced, funny, and knowledgeable. At times, physical therapy was extremely frustrating. I darn near passed out on the table one day when Rich was stretching out me knee. But the end result was worth it. Thanks to Rich, a year after my surgery I was able to run camelback mountain in 27 minutes and throw up 900 lbs for 8 reps on the leg press. Additionally, Rich fought with my insurance company to get me maximum benefit. Above and beyond with a great end result. Thanks Rich!
4 This is a great place for an affordable massage. The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was nice and relaxing. My favorite part was when they wrapped hot, damp towels on my feet...soooo relaxing!   So, if you are looking for a decent, inexpensive massage, this is the place for you.
5 We are so grateful for Ignite Physical Therapy! Our almost 4 year old daughter started PT for toe walking- a habit she was doing about 90% of the time. Joe has been working with her for the last few weeks and the transformation has been amazing! Between the time Joe has spent with her, the exercises he gave us to practice at home and the support Ignite has provided, I'm so thrilled to say that our daughter is walking on her entire foot almost 100% of the time already! We are truly impressed with Joe and the entire staff we have encountered at Ignite Physical Therapy. If we have any future PT needs, this will be our first stop! We would recommend them to anyone!
5 Ein perfekter Masseur mit medizinischer Ausbildung und dem Wissen um die Zusammenhänge im menschlichen Körper!! Er konnte mit seiner erfolgreichen und einfühlsamen Therapie eine geplante Schulteroperation verhindern! Ich spiele wieder erfolgreich in meiner Tennismannschaft und werde wieder Skilaufen können. Danke, Herr Zintel, ich kann Sie mit bestem Gewissen jedem Patienten empfehlen.
1 Very disappointing office. Front office staff was rude to me, then made me drive to a different office location because of a scheduling error. I saw a PA, not a doctor, who did absolutely nothing to help/diagnose with why I went into the office in the first place. No transparency from administration at all about costs/billing, and when I called to inquire about my account about a month after my visit, was shuffled around on the phone and on hold for 20 minutes before someone finally answered my questions. Found this office on ZocDoc, never going back to them again.  Update to my review...just got off the phone after 2 hours of back and forth with my insurance and this god awful doctors office. A flu shot  here costs $106 and a useless visit with a PA costs $276...NEVER, EVER, EVER GO TO THIS OFFICE! oh and if you do happen to get someone on the phone after waiting for 30+ minutes, they will be rude. Crystal and Priscilla, this is directed to you.
5 This is the second time my mother is at La Estancia. The first time was for a knee replacement a few years ago and now was for physical training. I would give this establishment 10 stars if I could, but 5 is the max. All the staff are exceptional, respectful, professional, courteous and above all care for you and your family member. I always evaluate a place by asking myself if I would be Ok to be there myself! And the answer is YES for La Estancia! Go visit the place and see how friendly and nice the staff is for your self!  Thank you LE for taking good care of my mom!!!!
5 Great service! Dr. Yee came to my office to assess my work space and suggest what I need for my work environment (ie: type of chair, keyboard, etc.) and she was fantastic! Super friendly an very informative.
1 After several weeks, I receive a call from his billing guys who tell me that the doctor wont change the bill, not that he cannot, but he wont because of doing so would amount to insurance fraud. When I asked her how correcting an incorrect bill amounts to fraud the lady got mad and told me not to argue with her.I told her I dont feel right about penalizing myself for no fault of mine. I am pursuing this with the benefits group at my work place and insurance. What i feel bad about it, we trust the doctors with our health and life. How can they be so unethical? Is there ever an end for this person's greed?
5 Dr. Harter and her staff are professional, caring and they go out of their way to help each patient. I'm so thankful I was referred to Pinnacle Internal Medicine.
1 I have been a patient here for my over 6 years, however the many of the old doctors have retired, and their spots have been filled with qualified but uncaring doctors.  I made an appointment with the hospital several weeks prior to look at my arm which I believed to be fractured or splintered at the bone.  Two days before my appointment a itchy bacterial rash spread across my back.  On appointment day I was told that I would have to choose between getting a prescription for the infection spreading across my back or them looking at my arm.  Of course the rash took precedence at the time, so 5 minutes and one small little piece of paper after my appointment started I was shuffled out the door--arm still in extreme pain, unacknowledged and ignored by the doctor.  Word of advice: If scheduling an appointment here, do NOT schedule with Dr. Luis M Irizarry.  He doesn't care about anything but herding cattle in and out the door so he can make as much money as possible in a given day.
5 Only my second time coming but absolutely love the calming environment. Staff has always been very friendly and attentive. Had a body wrap purchased with a Groupon on my first visit, was recommended to book with a friend since it was two to a room so I came with my sister. A bit o miscommunication while making my reservation but overall good experience. A bit pushy at checkout for additional services but that was expected. Was given a complementary sauna for my second visit to gain my business. Definitely prefer the.  infrared sauna over the body wrap; more privacy, less restrictive, and very calming.
5 I recently joined Wynn fitness Richmond hill location  It's very clean and I love the classes they have.  I signed up with Hamed Osmani. He has very good customer service and he gave me a very good deal. I also love the steam room and overall the whole facility!
2 My husband is extremely hesitant to go to the doctor's office for any reason, whether it's for a normal checkup or excruciating pain, he avoids it at all costs. I decided to go to Dr. Adams first for my annual checkup and loved her. She's really kind, personable, and non-robotic like most doctors. Her staff is super friendly as well so I scheduled an appt for my husband for a simple checkup. The wait time is ridiculous!! My hub's appt was at 8am, got here at 7:30 to fill out new patient paperwork and my husband didn't get called in to see the doctor until 9:20. He also opted in to get blood work done and after he saw the doc, they sent him to the other side of the office and he sat next to a lady who had been sitting waiting to get her blood work done since the moment we walked into the office at 7:30.   I get that doctor's offices have to verify insurance, overbook appts in case of no-shows, have very few rooms and only one doc on the floor, etc. I expected a total time of being here of an hour to and hour and a half but this is just too too long. What's an appt even for? I don't know how to fix things to make the wait time a tad less but please find a way. Good doctors are hard to find and long office procedures are a great way to drive patients away.
5 I have been a patient of Dr Dedinsky for over 3 years now.  I really like the time he takes during physicals and visits.  He is thorough and practical in his approach.  His office staff are competent, pleasant and efficient!
5 Would have preferred a shorter wait time in the lobby,  but who doesn't when going to Urgent Care.  Once name was called they were prompt with service.   Dr and assistant was very knowledgeable and friendly.  Their service level was definitely 5 star.
5 Ok. My much over due review. Dr. Sullivan has been my primary doc for years. He pulls out all the stop and goes above and beyond making calls to specialists and following up to make sure I've had the best care possible! He has worked with me when I changed jobs and insurance companies and coverage to make sure I have what I need to be healthy. This year he helped save my life. He and his team have had compassion and flexibility to make sure I felt like family.
4 Nurses and doctors were super sweet when I brought my 10 month old in with a rash. Speedy care with a smile.
3 I love the location of this gym because it is not always filled with people and i can actually work out. Usually the best time to work out is from 11am-3pm. It is two levels. All the cardio equipment is on the second floor along with many tv's. All the weight machines and free weights are on the first floor. They also have what's called a "Cardio Theater". Which is filled with elliptical machines, treadmills, and other machines. It is a dark room that has a different movie play each day. It definitely helps time go by faster and unnoticed.  Some other features of this gym is a lap pool, jacuzzi, and sauna. Last time i remember they keep the sauna at 150 degrees. There is both a men and women's locker room with showers. They also provide childcare.
1 I WAS TREATED LIKE A feeble minded fool. I was tossed out of ER as if nothing was wrong. 2 days later I was rushed by ambulance from work for Major Surgery on the Hernia I reported when I went to ER. I almost died.
5 I have had a persistent cough for a wile. I have been to my primary care physician and he wasn't much help. Came here first thing this morning  hoping to get some relief. These people took charge. They even did a chest x-ray on the spot. I will spare you all the details of what else went on but it was a great experience. Thank you so much!!!
5 I've had back problems for many many years and 2 neck surgeries since 1992.  I've had many differernt types of work done from reflexology, accupuntuce, rolfing, chiropractors (can't even remember how many of them), therapy etc... and I've also had many massages over the years.  I always tell them I want DEEP TISSUE, and usually get a gentle rubbing type massage.  I've had them ask me if the pressure was ok, and I'd tell them NO, go deeper, and most did, but for only a little while.  After much more searching, I found these reviews on YELP, and figured "what the hell", let me give him a shot.   WELL, let me tell you,  if you are looking for DEEP TISSUE massage; Jim Freeman is the man!!!  I can honestly say that I've never ever had any  "Masseuse" make me cry Uncle!  (Figure of speech LOL).  Only in a few instances in certain spots, did it really become too much, but Jim, as the Professional that he is knew when, where and how much to soften his touch, all the well knowing I was finally getting what I was looking for.  The knots in my neck, shoulders and back were finally subdued, and my lower back was relaxed.  I felt great.  I understand that 1 session will not undo 35 years of what I got going on, but I feel with every following session, there will be continued improvement.  There was and still is some tenderness in my Traps, but overall, I feel much better and will see Jim again, hopefully soon!  Also, Jims fee is very affordable for what you receive.  By the way, I got the 90 minute massage, which was more like a Theraputic session massage combined.  It's worth it!!!
5 Very professional - same day visit was not a problem. It's best to text and also call.
5 Dr. Bailey Freed is a very good doctor. She listens which is very important and also explain everything to the patient, answer questions and has a great personality. Always able to do her best. Also they are always do their best to accept emergency visits. Other doctors offices don't do the effort to see patient in that situation. Waiting time is normally a little long but you can talk to them and if is possible they'll do their best.
2 This is the worst-run medical facility I've ever been to. Nobody working here knows what they're doing except maybe the doctor who is giving immunizations.   I came here because they were the closest travel clinic, and I needed some immunizations before traveling to Asia. Every step of the way has been difficult, from checking in to filling out paperwork to getting recommendations for the proper immunizations. Getting Patient First to submit my information to my insurance company was a nightmare, and took at least five phone calls.   If you can go to any other travel clinic, I highly recommend it. This must be the worst.
1 It is so hard to find a good DR office in Vegas. A friend referred me over to Dr. Emery.  I was a little bit frustrated when it took a month to get an appointment for just a normal appointment, but I figured it was worth the wait based on what I have heard.   They recommended to me that I get to the appointment 15-20 min early to fill out paperwork, they also emailed it over to me which was very nice. I arrived 15 min early with my paperwork in hand, and then waited 30 minutes.   After 30 minutes the admin came over to inform me that Dr. Emery wouldn't be in for another 90 minutes, I could either wait, or I could reschedule my appointment, best part was, the next appointment wasn't for another 4 weeks out!!  Terrible terrible practice and service. I couldn't see another doctor and I had no choice, I couldn't wait another hour and a half for the doctor to maybe show up! They have a very large sign that says they charge $125 if the patient doesn't cancel within 24 hours, if only that worked both ways. What a waste!
5 Best doctor I've ever been to. He has discovered things about my health no one has ever found out about me. He is thorough and actually remembers who you are every time you come in. His office also gets you in same day usually.
5 In two sessions I felt more like my self and had no pain remaining.  I highly recommend Adam Swanson.  Having someone else stretch you helps you heal faster verses stretching on your own.  Thanks Adam!
5 I enjoy the employee at BFHS, I like the excellent care I get here at backfit. The message therapist as well as the front desk employee are super kind & compassionate
5 Loved my appointment with Paul; he read my tension like a book, had me completely at ease and performed an excellent massage. Will happily return.
4 I have no idea what these other patients have to complain about.  I've been with HFM for about 7 years.  They have been understanding and accommodating for short-term appt. requests they take the time to answer your questions and have good suggestions as to what form of treatment to pursue.  People expect a busy doctor's office to cater to them, that's virtually impossible these days, HFM tries hard and makes you feel important.
3 Used to be my family doc (we LOVE Dr. Guo!) but unfortunately now it takes over a month to get an appointment with her. Staff's customer service is iffy.
5 I had never attended a Pilates reformer class before, and I am so glad that I was smart enough to pick this studio.  I find myself looking forward to my class every week. :-) Vanessa is a wonderful instructor! Since there are only a max of 2 people per class, you really get a more individualized experience.  I leave feeling sore, but in a good way!  I have truly found a love for Pilates and will continue to recommend this studio!
5 Great place to be treated in a desert of mediocre physicians.  Doctors Reddy and Bahtia and first class physicians.  PA Marlina Robinson is a straight shooter who tells it like it is.  She cares for her patients and advocates for them.  She works with all patients, including people with behavioral medicine issues.  They are busy, but have never waited for more than 20 minutes.  That is understandable, since they make every patient feel like they are the only person being served for the day.  They take their time in treatment and diagnosis-- so you know they are treating you appropriately.  Good referrals to specialists when needed.  This is a great reflection on them.  They have my trust.  And I work in healthcare, so I know what I am talking about.
2 TOCA is great at times and definitely below the standard of care at other times. For sure, if you ever have a bad experience and try to discuss with them, you will be so disappointed, you will grab your records and run to the nearest orthopedic office that is NOT TOCA!! Not one person will call me back - it's been a month and 5 phone calls pleasantly made to the office and multiple VMs, no one cared to call me back. I finally got my records and went to CORE Institute.  they are extremely professional.
5 I LOVE this place! I have been going to Dr Gage for many years now. I drive 30 minutes each way to his office and it is definitely worth the drive. Dr Gage also began seeing my 2 year old since the week after he was born and the entire staff is great with kids! Dr Gage treated my son for food allergies and I was shocked with the immediate results. Thanks to Dr Gage my son now enjoys many foods he was unable to eat before. Dr Gage is very knowledgable and always listens to any questions or concerns. I highly recommend Dr Gage to anyone.
1 I have been a patient of Dr. White's for over 10 years. Back when he was located a Flamingo and Buffalo.   His office staff is horrible and makes if impossible to me to see him anymore based on the following:  Appointments - was sick with a sinus infection. Called first thing in the morning and got the recorded message. So I leave my information. Hour goes by and no returned call. So I call, and call, and keep calling until I get a live voice. They can get me in same day at noon. So I am in the exam room ,waiting for the doctor and my phone rings. It is the office calling me back from the morning to schedule an appointment.   I called on June 29th, because I have a skipped rib in my back and am in pain. I was told first available is in August. And to call back the next day to see if there is an cancellations. I call back, was put on hold for 20 minutes with no reply.   Pharmacy - I have had the pharmacy call the doctors office on several occasion because of my insurance change, and they never received a call back. Oh, on one occasion they did call back on year later.   Billing - I received a statement in the mail saying I owed money for some insurance mix up. The actual service was from 1 1/2 years ago. I call my insurance company and they say they aren't even billing me the contracted price. Statement said I owed $200, contacted price was $70 and I had a copayment of $30. Which the statement didn't even show the copayment. So I owed 40 bucks. If I didn't follow thru I would have gotten ripped of $160.00 dollars.   Its a shame because Dr. White is a great doctor, but with horrible customer service time and time again, its time for me to move on.   Not sure if Dr. White knows what's going on, but I hope he reads this.
5 I've been going to chiropractors for the past 35 years.  All used manual manipulation which I thought was the "best" way.  My husband had used Dr. Woolston for several years and loved the Pro Adjuster method he uses.  So I thought I'd try it - once.  Now, 2 months later, I continue to go and have had amazing results.    Since I use a chiropractor as my primary physician I have asked Dr. Woolston to address things that one would not usually think of as chiropractic.  He has worked on my hands and knees and both have improved.  I have considerably less swelling and pain in my knees and can now stand and walk for much longer periods.  I was having trigger finger issues in my hand and that is improving as well.  I can only say that I am more than pleased.  Dr. Woolston believes in the whole body working to improve conditions.  I share that belief.  He has given me stretches and exercise so that I can assist in achieving my optimal health.  After all - if I don't do anything to change or improve my habits how can I expect the doctor's efforts to work as well as I want them to.  Do I expect results in 1 or 2 visits?  Absolutely not - it took many years for develop an issue, how can I expect it to go away in a short time?  I'm not looking for symptomatic relief, I am looking for a return to a natural state of well being.  Dr. Woolston also shares his ongoing research into the latest developments in healing through chiropractic, nutrition, weight loss & exercise.  I love his passion and burning desire to help.  He truly cares about his patients.  I see that there are some reviews about the massage therpists.  This is a separate part of the business.  They do indeed have a "rub club" and you prepay for your monthly massage.  My husband is using the rub club and loving his therapeutic massages. So the rundown is that if  you miss 1 month then that massage rolls over to the next month - however, if you don't call for 60 days you will lose that missed massage.  They tell you all of this up front so it isn't the fault of the office if you don't pay attention.  Like all "club" types of things you get a discounted rate for prepayment but there are "rules" that go along with it.  All responsible adults realize this and accept this.  If you don't want to go by those rules, pay by the massage and make your life easier.  I personally love the Pro Adjuster (or "thumper" as I have nicknamed it).  I never thought I would say this but this method works better than any manual adjustment I've ever had!  Big Kudos to Dr. Woolston - a truly passionate & caring man!  BTW - go to the bottom of the reviews and click on the (9 filtered reviews).
1 I was sent here recently because the CORE office I normally go to was booked up. The waiting area is huge, although not as big as the one on Union Hills (thank God). The atmosphere is chaotic and loud, and hard to hear when your name is called. The receptionists seemed pretty friendly, albeit overwhelmed.  Inside, past the waiting room, is a myriad of halls, which can be confusing (I had to go give a urine sample and got lost).   The service is just the same. The techs seem awkward. It's very impersonal. Jocelyn, who called a day or two beforehand to notify me of my appointment, was completely lackluster and was obviously perturbed that she had to make the call.  I believe my doctor most certainly has a sense of disdain for AHCCCS (Medicaid) patients. He brings it up regularly, and has absolutely no regard or empathy for my pain. I told him I threw up for a day and a half because the pain was so bad, and he looked unimpressed, maybe even irritated. Then he asked me if I was sure my insurance approved Zofran ODT.   To quote Brian Regan, "I'm no DOCTOR, BUT--" it seems to me that the right reaction to the fact that I have regular bouts of nausea and vomiting due to pain would be a modicum of empathy. I understand that as a physician, it's important to maintain professionalism, but on the other hand, relating with the patient is vital, too. I don't understand why this level of pain is acceptable. I have been going to the CORE Institute for nearly a year, and my health has become grievously worse. It's very likely that it was going to decline, but the failsafes like pain management should be helping more than they are.  I keep hearing that I should change from the Core's McPain Management to somewhere else, but I'm wondering if they're all this impersonal, unfeeling, and slow going for relief. I'm going through all the pills, all the procedures, doing everything it takes, and I'm being offered more options to try alleviate my misery by my rheumatologist than I ever have here. I am going to stick with it for now and hope that I will get the help I need. We'll see.
1 I suggest you choose another office. I think dr Obeng is a pill pusher. He tried me on farxiga which shut my kidneys down then it was tanzem which has a tumor warning. He had me on phentermine with my high bp. Besides that I was extremely sick today they had a 2 hr wait so I went to urgent care where they called alfa to get approval and they denied me twice because I could have sat there 2 hrs waiting when I was having trouble breathing. So now I'm sitting in the er where I probably should have just went in the first place. I would say that receptionist is cold and uncaring . I called to tell them I would no longer be a patient and she said that's fine.. so they obviously do not care that I have been going there for years. I'm currently looking for a new doctor I will not be returning here.
2 Went back a 2nd time for a review of my x-rays...and again they didn't have me down for an appointment. They are the only office in Scottsdale, it can't be that confusing. :/
5 I'm a lucky guy. Valley Physical Therapy saved my shoulder. You see, I was attacked by a giant bird. It swooped down from the sky and tore my right arm from its socket, causing a severely torn rotator cuff. The doctor said there is only one place to go for therapy. Valley Physical Therapy. He said sure there are other places but none like VPT. he was right. Doug and his team are dedicated to your success. Without a doubt the best physical therapy clinic in Arizona, bar none! Don't waste your time calling other clinics. You won't regret it...BC
5 Excellent, convenient service, efficient and extremely friendly!  I recently relocated from out of state and needed a physician in a very timely manner. This group far exceeded my expectations!
5 From the minute I walked in, this place was amazing.  I had a sinus infection, and it was getting worse by the minute.  I really needed medicine fast.  They got me in and out with medicine in a little under 45 minutes.  Service was fantastic.  I wish I could remember the name of the P.A., but I can not.  She was so helpful:) Thank you!!!
1 I am writing this review solely in reference to the Nurse Practitioner that you are forced to see when you are new patient, Jiji Ochoa.  Short version:  Refuse to accept an appointment with this woman.    I haven't had health insurance in about a decade and went in for my first visit.  For a place called Dignity Health, I have never been treated with such disrespect.  Her interpersonal communication skills are non existent.  And due to her inability to speak clearly, not her accent, it was a struggle to understand anything she said.  When I asked any questions she became so rude and defensive she would literally leave the room.    When I spoke to another employee about the experience they rolled their eyes and apologized.  Not only did this "practitioner" seem to have zero knowledge about literally anything, her total lack of any kind of compassion or respect was disgusting.  She starts out as a bully and then when you come back at her she leaves the room for up to 20 minutes.  The worst medical experience of my life.  And that includes a clinics in Indonesia and India.  I'm returning for my follow up with Dr. Ritter, but only because I've heard amazing things about her.  Every other aspect of my visit was a 4 to 5 star experience and I'm going back to see Dr Ritter and will update it at that time.  I feel sorry for the rest of the staff that seem to be giving 100% and were nothing, but pleasant and efficient.  I hope someone from Dignity looks into this wench who no doubt spends her days bullying the waiting room full of older, sicker patients.  She definitely wasn't used to someone coming back at her.  She is a disgrace to the medical profession.
1 Been seeing Dr. Johnson for the last 10 years.  Never loved him, he was just convenient. He always seemed more interested in discussing his golf game than the reason I came to see him.  What I did love was that he was near my office and could always get me in the same day.  He was good for getting a prescription when I was sick.  Not anymore.  I just called and was informed he sold the practice to Dignity Health and the earliest they could see me was October.  Time to find a new doc.  At least I won't have to listen to him bitch about Obamacare anymore!
5 I have to say I have never had experience like this from a chiropractor facility. In starting here at aliante IPM it has been way more. I get the royal treatment everytime I come in. They greet you by name the minute you walk thru the door. The assistants, physicians, chiropractors, nurses, physical therapist are fabulous. They are always on their game. They are their to help you reach your goal. I'm starting to feel much better and starting to correct my back and neck issues. They truly understand the emotional toll that pain can cause. They have been patient with me and understand the importance of explaining the process and progress along the way. Thank you so much aliante IPM.   I recommend them all the way!
5 After a serious automobile accident, I called DIPT and they got me in right away and started me on a full program to recovery. I can happily say that I am back to my normal self after a few months of treatment. The friendly and accommodating staff made all the difference. I worked with Dave and Arianna and both were great and knowledgeable. I would highly recommend DIPT.
5 For years a friend of mine has been trying to get me into a Bikram class with her at this studio and I have refused, afraid I would pass out or become nauseated from the heat. However, this last weekend I finally took the plunge!!   Walking into the studio I was immediately greeted by Shyam who told me what I could expect, where my focus should be, and overall tips for me to feel successful after the 90 minutes was up. He explained the main goal was to just stay in the room, whether I did yoga for the entire 90 minutes or not. Shyam was very good about helping me throughout the class so I understood the proper poses and how to breathe. He was very encouraging and made me feel calm.   Drop in classes are $17 or you can purchase your first month for only $29. I went ahead and bought my first month at $29, knowing that even if I only go one more time I would already be saving money.   I plan to return to this studio over the next month on a regular basis.
2 This is my second time here and still haven't seen a doctor just RN. My appointment was a 3pm and I've been sitting in this room for about an hour. This will be the last time I come here.
5 I have been seeing Dr. Batlan for over a year now.  First for my neck problems now for lumbar problems.   I just had my first surgical injection last Monday and I have to say I feel much better already.  It's nice to be out of pain for a change !   I don't think patients understand that Dr. Batlan really does have your best interest at heart.  He listens to what you have to say, but you also have to listen to what he says, as well as comprehending the problem and solutions. Dr. Batlan will take the time to  answer questions you might have.  He has a very efficient staff that allows him to see as many patients as he does.  There have been an occasional mix up with appointments and his staff still works me in without a horrific waiting time.  The one thing I like above all is the fact that if you have an appointment with the doctor, you see the doctor.  You don't get dished off to a P.A., this isn't true of other pain management groups, this I know for a fact. His staff always keeps me apprised of insurance approvals etc. Dr. Balan has helped relieve the back pain I have suffered for quite sometime and that alone is worth the price of admission !
4 AhhMazing service and ambiance, just south of King and Young. Great RMTs. Their lounge area with jacuzzi has a true "into the wild" feel to it! Our massage service was a bliss!
5 I came here for ostheo treatment and was very happy with my experience ! The office is very modern and clean and they offer appointments even after regular working hours and weekends which is a big plus.You can book an appointment quickly and easily online which is also a plus but of course you can also book by phone if you wish. They're in a convenient location on Monkland avenue within walking distance of villa Maria metro and a natural health food store. I saw Aurore Barea, she was gentle and knowledgable and my treatment was very effective. I liked that She took the time to explain to me what she was doing and why as well as explain to me what I would be feeling over the next few days so I would know what to expect and she was spot on. The price of treatment was also more than fair. I have to say I will definitely recommend her and this clinic to others. In addition to ostheo they also offer psychology, massage kinesiology treatment and more. The only thing is they only take cash, no credit or debit but they do mention that to you in advance when you get your email confirmation for your appointment. I'm very happy I discovered this place !
5 My experience at Physiotherapy was fantastic.  I have had numerous knee surgeries, suffered complications, and had to attend PT for 10+ months 3-5 times a week.  The staff was attentive and friendly and made the experience as enjoyable as it could have been.
5 Outstanding as usual...all the physicians are extremly well versed in their fields of expertise...wouldnt go anywhere else...
5 I've had about 5 family doctors throughout my life, due to geographic moves for the most part. I left my last doctor in Scottsdale because I felt 1) customer service and wait times were ludicrous, 2) money and transaction speed were obviously the doctors primary goal (to the point of his discussing how well he was doing every time you went in), and  3) questionable practice decisions.  Finding Paradise Family Medicine was a gift.   Dr. Coulombe and other staff members are extremely professional (my wife, an RN for 20+ years agrees).  He will call after procedures for follow-up.  In addition, he or staff will get back via email or call in the case of heightened need or emergency.  Wait times are reasonable and the staff is courteous.  His "bedside" manners are warm, yet professional and he listens when you talk!
1 Very poor customer service at this office. They put you on hold for a long time when you call, it can be up to 45 minutes. My wife called this morning, regarding her medicine. She needed to speak to the nurse. My wife called 2 times was put on hold for a long time, a least 20 minutes both times. My wife left a message for the nurse to call back, we don't even know if the nurse is getting the message. After the second call asking to speak to the nurse, after my wife was waiting on hold for 20 minutes. My wife said to Rachel that answered the phone "is it right to keep patients on hold for 20 minutes " she said some patients are on for 45 minutes! Also this office worker was very rude on the phone. Also I want to add to this review, when my wife and I come out of doctors office we see the office people putting patients on hold while they talk to each other and texting on their phones. All my wife & I want to know is, where is the patients care & service we deserve as patients to this office?
2 So there is no misunderstanding or confusion, my podiatrist, Dr Delassandro, works here. I followed her here from her last office. Dr D is great. I couldn't ask for a better doc. If you are in need of a fun, funny, personable, caring, genuine doctor for your foot troubles I recommend her wholeheartedly. I trust her 100%. You won't be disappointed. She is fantastic.  I wouldn't voluntarily come here. I only do because this is where Dr D is.   The office staff however, is another story. I have been to both locations, here & Henderson, and one office is not better then the other. Their lack of communication, both with me & amongst each other,  is staggering. I shouldn't receive phone calls prior to an appointment asking why am I coming in or what is it I am being seen for. I shouldn't have one person tell me I'll receive a phone call to set up an EMG and another phone call asking me why haven't I scheduled it.  If I ask one office to get a message to her about a renewed injury, the office she is at shouldn't respond with, "Well what does she want us to do about it," especially when I am standing right there watching & listening as this happen.    I am still waiting on the rheumatology referral Dr D asked the staff to get me 2 months ago.   Las Vegas is full of doctors and it is extremely difficult to find a good one. When you do, the office staff are the last people you want to bother with but sadly you must. If I could rate Dr D I would give her 10 stars. The staff however makes this place difficult to deal with & effects your care. Know that if you come here you will have to stay on top of them to make sure something is done. This place has a few great doctors so don't let the staff screw with or up what your doctor has outlined for you & your care. It shouldn't be this way, but sadly it is. Ultimately you are in charge of your health...don't let the staff muck it up. Be diligent. Question everything that differs from what you've discussed with your doc.   There are things about this place I do like. They do EMGs onsite so unless you have wonky insurance you shouldn't have to go elsewhere. Same with MRIs. I wasn't able to have my MRI done here bc of my insurance but you might be able to. It is convenient. I also have an issue with my neck & back. The ortho I saw previously only wanted to cut me open. I will get a 2nd opinion from someone here. 2 doctor appointments on the same day at the same office. Doesn't get more convenient than that.
5 This was my first visit & I found the office to be very clean, the staff was awesome & the doctor was just as nice & very informative. Id definitely refer my family & friends! & ok glad I've finally found me a OB close to home
5 This place is a sanctuary for anyone suffering from motor vehicle accidents! The staff, though young is very knowledgeable, polite, and considerate. They'll work with any schedule and seem to only have your best interest at heart. The flexion distraction machine is a God send! If you have lower back issues, this will save your life! Oh yeah, and they're questionnaires to get you started are all completed via electronic tablet. Sign documents and even sign in using a tablet!
5 Had to wait quite a bit, but Dr. Reddy was great. So far so good.  Dr Reddy made me feel comfortable and spent more than the normal time with me. He really listened to what I was telling him about my past history and explained his recommendations in an easy to understand manor. I left feeling very confident that Dr. Reddy is a great doctor.   I'm to return in two months, so I'll keep you posted.  Office staff also seemed nice.
1 Be prepared to wait a long time.  Just need a throat culture or a vaccination? Go to a minute clinic.   They also like to throw a lot of extras at you like a hearing test for your kids that will show up on your bill.  Expensive and slow. You can do better.
4 Julie was awesome! Accomodating and friendly. I saw this deal on groupon and I couldnt let that deal pass by. I contacted julie and was able to get me in the next day. Oh man this wraps are awesome. I was sweating just like how i sweat when i do my zumba...lol Julie's personality even made it more awesome. She explained everything before she started wrapping me up. Explained to me what I need to do post procedure. Cant wait to go back for my second session.  I guess i knocked off one star because I had a little hard time finding them. Once i Got to the parking lot and saw the bldg and unit number, the sign says sabat salon so i wasnt sure if I had the correct address, yet i went in and figured out wellness body wraps is inside sabat salon. Lol
1 Only left one star because I had to. I got there at 1 I was told 2 hour wait. By 4 pm I ask how long the wait was because I has seen 3 walk in come and go already. I was then told I had to wait another hour. Needles to say after another hour and a half I left without being seen. I will never go here again would rather wait in the ER......
5 Love this place!  Friendly and helpful staff... excellent providers!  Would always recommend!!
1 Stay clear of this place unless you want a huge headache.  Here is our experience with this dishonest business.  We were referred here by Phoenix Children's Hospital for a pectus brace for our 13 year old son. The brace, made by Pongratz, was suppose to be free as part of a clinical trial. My son wore the brace 3 months until the PLASTIC clasp providing tension to the brace broke.  Took the brace in for Joe Pongratz to fix. He kept the brace for 3-4 weeks while a new plastic clasp was on order. During that wait, all the progress my son achieved from the brace was reversed. When my husband went back in to pick up the brace Joe told him that my son wasn't part of the free study (although we have the paperwork to prove it) and that the study was over. On the way out, the office staff asked my husband for our insurance card so they can bill office visits. They assured him that Pongratz will pay our copay since we are part of their study. Three months later the plastic clasp breaks again! Not wanting to deal with the design flaw and long wait to fix it we decided to get a new rx from the doctor and get a new brace elsewhere.  That was when we discovered that Pongratz had just billed our insurance $1000 for the brace! They had lied to us and our insurance. They fraudulently billed our insurance in Sept for a brace we picked up in months before. We didn't even have that insurance when we got the brace! Prime example of insurance fraud. All my calls to their office have never been returned. Now I'm left with a $280 copay for a useless Pongratz brace plus the cost of a second brace.
2 Short wait but the ER has seen better days, at first glance you might be tempted to leave based on appearances. But hey, you're here for an emergency right?  It took two visits to the ER and what I can only imagine are astronomical hospital bills to find what should have been found the first time.
4 I went to RPM again yesterday and took my first "Gravity Strength" class and I almost passed out.  Literally.  My scalp started tingling and I had to stop.  After spin class, I walked into a room with 8 contraptions called Gravity.  Gravity is a machine that is designed to essentially use your body weight as resistance through a cable pulley system attached to a glide board.  The class was led by an instructor and he walked us through a series of exercises that work your entire body like a circuit.  There are no breaks between the exercises except when you shift positions on the machines.  What I loved about the method is it helps you build functional strength - it mimics stuff that you would do in real life.  Really, when would a bench press benefit you in real life except maybe when you decide to frolic with someone way beyond your weight class.  It was tough, but then again I'm kind of a wuss.  I loved it and I'll return... likely next month when I recover.  If you do decide to go to Gravity, then bundle up.  Man, they gotta turn the heat up at the place coz' it's just too darn cold.
1 IMPORTANT UPDATE: After my initial review (posted below), I received a certified letter in the mail from Davidson Family Medicine letting me know they are dropping me as a patient and I have 30 days to find a new doctor. There was no follow-up phone call from a doctor inquiring about the nature of my complaint or my health condition regarding possible exposure to Zika. I never got the chance to actually talk to a doctor. They decided to drop me as a patient based on the lack of service from their office manager. I have never been treated so poorly by a physician's office in my life. Beware of posting critical (but true) feedback about Davidson Family Medicine. They retaliate very quickly!  ---  I called the office to request a Zika blood test for my wife and I, since we'd recently spent 3 weeks in the Caribbean. The two office staff I spoke with were not helpful, so they passed me along to the office manager. The office manager proceeded to tell me that they did not do Zika testing even after I explained the new policies in Zika testing relayed to me from the state health department. The office manager refused to call the nurse at the state department even after I provided her with the nurses name and phone number. The conversation ended with her recommending that I find a different doctor's office. I am still in disbelief that medical professionals would be so dismissive when dealing with a serious virus. I hope this post reaches others who may have had similar experiences with Davidson Family Medical.
4 This is my second time to visit doctor by appointment . My appointment was 4.30 pm but i got call to see doctor at 5.30 pm . The nurse  she was nice and i had appointment with doctor tafreshi but i met his sturdemt doctor instead . She was nice and helpful .  So when the time doctor tafreshi came he took only 5 mins to get my paper work done . So overall for this visit took 2 hours .
1 First time ever; Doctor no-show for me.  I made an appointment with Dr. Harold Meyerowitz for an FAA flight physical about 2 weeks before the appointment date (Monday, October 2, 2017) to coincide with a road trip return home.  The family and I drove a couple hours out of our way to make it to the appointment.  When I walked through the doors, about thirty minutes early, the receptionist informed me that the doctor had inexplicably left for the day.  The explanation that she provided was that I was "his last appointment for the afternoon."  As though it is a custom of his to desert before his last afternoon appointment.  Perhaps this is a Dr. Meyerowitz tradition? I was definitely pretty angry to hear that news.  But, I have waited 2 weeks to cool off before submitting an angry review.  Turns out, even two weeks later, I still find it completely rude to skip out on an appointment leaving a receptionist behind to try to explain away your laziness and cowardice.  Avoid at all costs.  I'll encourage all fellow military aviation peers in my community to do the same.  Absolutely awful professionalism.
2 The last two visits I haven't been able to see Dr. Barry. She's always booked way out in advance. I kind of find that super annoying to have to meet with a nurse when I'm there to see a doctor. I've decided to give it a chance and see how I feel about it later, although the staff in the front office are rude, moody, and awkward. They don't even greet you properly when you walk in the door. Poor customer service, and they need help with their skills.
1 This lady isn't a doctor she is a heartless money grabbing snake! I walk into the office for my appointment to find out the doctor refuses to see Me because I won't get the injections. I had canceled my appointment for the injection because nobody can tell me what it's going to cost. They tell me they can't tell me because they don't know how much my insurance company is going to pay. So I call my insurance company to ask them and they say they don't know because they don't know how much the doctor is going to bill.... Just a big racket!!!!!! I have 2 herniated disc's and now I'm without medication! The medication they say I need!!!! It helps with the pain!!!! But she doesn't care about her patients. She only cares about money! Doctor = Trash!!! She could have seen me one more time and gave me time to find another doc that isn't a Demond for money! A real doctor! I have never felt more used!!! So here comes the pain!  All this doctor wants to do is suck every last dime out of you and then send you to collections, then ruin your credit, then ruin your life!!!!! Shame on you lady!!!! That is out right blackmail!!!!! Give me thousands of dollars out of your pocket or I refuse to see you!!!! I DONT HAVE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ASSHOLE!!!!!!!
1 I just walked out of the office of PA Marlina Robinson. I've never done that in all of my years dealing with healthcare providers. The front office was rude and when I tried to discuss that with Marlina, she became  incredibly defensive and patronizing. This was, quite frankly, the worst experience I've had with a primary care provider.
4 I am losing weight and understanding better how this is supposed to work! Jennifer is great and very through The staff Is wonderful also!
1 Eh it could be better. The front desk employees never acknowledge you. Ignore is a better word. Do they even care if people just walk in? If I have to scan my membership card then I expect you to do it, not have me wait 5 mins without being acknowledged. But at the end of the day I'm here to work out. So whatever.
1 i have  been a patient since 2013 always loved the office dr norley great  but now she is no longer practicing there  its kind of different  I did not even know she no longer there and I had a appointment they said she isn't there  could someone have sent a letter a call something  she was my primary doctor  oh well  I guess not that that important  the office manager was not very customer service friendly we are all  customers to a extent just  not tell me why I should stay  im a easy to take care of patient don't ask for much you know that might be my problem!! goodbye primary care . off to find a new doc  no Bueno!!
4 Had some issues initially with my insurance verses what they bill and why, but the owner had graciously taken care of my issue.If you want care on a more personal level,then this is the place!!!
1 I really wish I could give 0 stars for this place. They dont seem to care about the patients or their needs or how they can help them, they seem to only care about money. They call the patients to have them come in for an appointment the same day. I told the lady that I was not sure I would be able to make the appointment she told me to go ahead and make the appointment and if I couldn't make it to give her a call back. Well I called back to let them know I would not be able to make the time that they wanted us to be there and she told me that if I did not show up there would be a $30 cancellation no show fee because we did not give them 24 hour notice. I've been fighting the $30 fee with them for months now. Everytime I call they say they need to speak with the manager Joe and that will give us a call back but no one ever does. Anytime that I ask to speak to Joe directly I'm always told that he's in a meeting or he's not there or he's busy and can't come to the phone how convenient. Horrible service and rude. I would not suggest going to this places are only interested in your money and not the care of their patients.
1 Was in a car accident and referred to this place by my lawyer. Went in to get the paperwork, was 15+ pages and asked the same questions multiple times. I called and left a voice mail to try and get help but no return call.  My arm is now throbbing in pain from having attempted to get through just filling out the paperwork and I have cancelled my appointment.  I wanted to make sure I wasn't exaggerating so I went back and counted, its actually 19 pages... ridiculous
3 Came in one day after work. The receptionist said it would be about 45 minutes to see the doctor but ended up only being about 25 minutes.  The doctor was nice and had great bedside manner. He wrote up the forms I needed to get some blood work done and sent me on my way. I was in and out in under 10 minutes.  I returned the next morning to see the lab tech for my blood work. Though they open at 9 and I was first in line to see the tech, she did not see me until almost 9:30. Once I was in she was great. She had the needle in on the first try and thanks to my excellent pumping skills, I had the vials filled in no time.
1 Don't go here unethical unfriendly and uneducated staff rude an inconsiderate!!! If these people dont like to handle peoples piss for drug test then maybe they should go work somewhere else and not cope an attitude. The people are beyond rude! Sad I had to go here for a job drug test, go prepared to deal with retards.
1 HORRIBLE! Very very very unprofessional staff in the back! I went in because I had a question about a medication from one of my doctors and being the weekend  long story short back office staff choose to sit around and talk about me neglect the fact I was waiting and other people were back there not sure what oath those people took but absolutely no patient privacy at this place drive a extra ten minutes and go somewhere else not worth it! I left the same as I went in NEVER Again I HOPE THAT PLACE GETS SHUT DOWN AND THEY All Get THEIR LICENSES PULLED I refuse to even give a star btw
2 Every time I've been here I hear the nurses and doctors constantly bickering in the back, nobody seems too happy to be working here, lots of negativity in the air. I'm currently looking for another doctor, hopefully in a happier place.
5 I have been going to this place for a couple months now and I could not be more thrilled that I found it while dealing with some back issues. The whole staff is friendly and helpful with any question or concern that you have. Specifically working with Dr. Robey has been really helpful as he actually listens and works on what is hurting me and gives me advice to help myself throughout the week when I am not there. I highly recommend if you have any constant pain or bothering you that you go to the Las Vegas Pain Relief Center and you will be feeling great after.
1 I would give zero stars if I could. I went here because I was hurt at work. Long wait times, incompetent receptionists and horrible physical therapy. The doctors were two stars at best. Physical therapists more interested in the TV than their care. Horrible experience all around
5 This place is absolutely amazing!!! The staff is so friendly and professional, and they seriously care about the patient! My husband has been getting intensive work on his spine with adjustments, PT, massage and decompression and the improvement is unbelievable. They take a wholistic approach, without drugs or surgery, and actually FIX the problem!!! Go check them out. Amazing.
2 This location, the doctors, and the front desk staff were amazing. I've been seeing Marti for years and she has been great. But ever since Banner took over the whole thing has gone down hill. I tried to make an appointment and they don't have any of my files anymore, so I have to provide all of the info again (they won't even book you without your insurance information on file). Then I find out that my co-pay no longer even covers my "doctor" because she is a PA. Now I have to pay twice that, the Specialist price, because of their contract with Banner.  The plus side is that the front desk / schedulers are incredibly patient and pleasant to work with over the phone.
5 My Guy had back pain after a gym accident that hadn't gone away after a few weeks. He didn't want to see a regular doctor due to the fear of just getting a prescription that would mask the pain but not treat it. Working nights, it can be hard to find a place to go to that is open during the times you are normally awake and have to push back appointments till you have a day off so you can come in during business hours. That was not the case at all here. They are open later making is super convent to go before work or just on based on the normal activity level. He called and explained what was going on, the lady on the phone was so sweet she was even able to work him in the same day. All he could do was rave about how much better he felt after the first session. The next day he had another appointment before work and when he got home this morning, he kept telling me how much better he was feeling even with being on his feet all day. The Staff is friendly and the doctor is great. He signed up for a few more sessions and can't wait till his back is at 100% again.
5 I saw Dr. Lundgren for a few months regarding severe back-pain and would completely recommend him. The facility is nice and clean and has a very relaxing atmosphere for treatments. The doctor himself is very friendly, helpful. Although I was hoping for a quick cure, I realized that chiropractic care is long and drawn out for acute pains - it was helpful nevertheless.
4 My poor roommate wasn't feeling well so I googled "Best walk in clinics Toronto" and Infinity was at the top of the list. The main selling point had to be that you can make an appointment! :)   This is a secondhand experience since I wasn't the patient but I didn't find anything particularly off putting about the staff (though the pharmacy employees next door were awesome). Roomie said the doctor was very nice and professional and prescribed her what she needed.   All in all, a satisfactory experience.
1 I wanted to like this office because it is so conveniently located by my house, and I stuck with them for a few months until I gave up and had to go somewhere else.  Dr. Kurvilla clearly didn't listen to my concerns, seemed a little condescending (which I am a college graduate with a science degree in Exercise Science and personal trainer, I know anatomy...) and just said I had a case of plantar fascitis.  Put a shot in my foot, ordered me a bunch of pills and sent me to nearly 20 sessions/6 wks of PT, all which did NOTHING. I later got handed over to Dr. Delassandro, bc Dr. K had just left for the day out of the blue, but Dr. D who is a really nice lady, listened much more than Dr. K, but I still never got a clear diagnoses and wore a boot/air cast for 6 weeks that it turned out, I never needed.  As Dr. D is a thorough doctor, she referred me out to lots of testing, but the office is so disorganized, they referred me out to several places that weren't even covered by my insurance.  I didn't even know until I showed up at the test appointments and was made to pay outrageous co-pays like hundreds BEFORE the appointment.  Also, good luck getting someone to call you back.  I called and left messages for several assistants and never got calls back until I would really really gripe at someone.  One time they said they had read my chart wrong, that's why no one called me back, and 2 other times they blamed it on the referring doctors' offices why they didn't call back.  If you don't heed my advice and you go here anyway, YOU MUST STAY ON TOP OF THEM to get anything taken care of.  You are just a number.  And sometimes I'm ok with that, but there are just too many mistakes at this office- they really don't care about you.  When I finally gave up on this office, I requested my medical records, sent them the fax and left the messages they required, and still no word back.  I finally again got pushy and low and behold, someone gathered all my records within the hour.  When I actually got them and went through them, some of the records SAID I WAS A MAN even!? Again, you are a nobody to this office.  Save your time and money and go to Sunrise Foot and Ankle to Dr. Wood.  He had my issue diagnosed on the first visit and I OBVIOUSLY needed surgery, not a boot and it WASN'T just plantar fascitis that would be fixed with a shot, pills and PT!  I had the surgery and am 95% recovered with the issue gone (which was a mass of cartilage that had been growing into a tumor and then snapped off my bone) ALL this from my 1st appointment ever meeting the doctor to recovery from surgery happened UNDER 3 WEEKS AND UNDER $100- INCLUDING THE SURGERY because they are ALL on top of what your insurance is, from reception to the doctor!!  (See my SUNRISE foot and ankle review).  If you still go to Advanced Orthopedics, all I have to say is, YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.
2 I am a huge procrastinator, I also hate going to Dr's, not because I am scared, but because I dislike the process and what it has turned into. You are seen by a receptionist, a medical assistant, a PA or RNP and you rarely get to see an actual Dr but end up paying Dr rates for. So I put off finding a family Dr in the Phoenix metro area and crossed my fingers we didn't get sick (huge mistake and also very irresponsible on my part) and of course one of those times I was sick enough that I needed to find a Dr that could tell me what was wrong.   So I went to this urgent care, I called before to make sure the wait wasn't too long and to see if they took my insurance, they said no wait and yes to my insurance.  I walked in, was not greeted by the receptionist who apparantly had better things to do then, you know, be a receptionist, when she finally finished doing those other receptionist things, she acknowledged me and handed me some forms to fill up.  I turned in my forms and waited about 40 minutes to finally be called in, there was one other patient in the waiting area. Once I was called, by what I am assuming is a medical assistant (who needed to wash her scrubs), she asked me about my symptoms, made her notes, asked me to pee on a cup and wait in a room. Then a PA came in along with a person who I assumed was either the trainer or the trainee, not sure, and it doesn't matter. The PA examined me, and told me what was wrong with me, there was no bedside manners and they both looked like it was awkward for them to examine me.Once they were finished i was told to go to the front to be checked out. At the front I was told this is your prescription and it will be $15.00 for it, I was given a Dr's note after I asked for it a second time. Only once I got home did I realized the "Dr" failed to sign it.  So aside from being less than friendly and having a wait time that was not what was quoted 10 minutes before I got there, I also have a huge issue with the way they handled the prescription situation. With my insurance, I pay a $5.00 copay for most medications, the medication they prescribed and filled without my authorization being one of them. Had I not been sick, I would have questioned that, but I was sick and wanted to go home back to bed. To some this may only be $10 and worth it for the convenience, but I would like to be the one to choose who fills my prescription.
5 If you have more than regular back pain and you're looking for answers this is the place.  This is not my first time with this style of therapy after getting hurt in the military.  So far I've been to twice and I already see results. Best of all is how comfortable you'll feel. I'll update as I progress.  Oh and the pre authorization process was a big relief.
5 I had severe neck pain for about 18 months, the pain was constant and reduced the motion in my head/neck drastically. Driving (checking blind spots), checking behind me etc.. all very painful. I was referred to Dr. Bob Donatelli by an orthopedic surgeon. Dr. Bob was able to identify the problem and improve my range of motion over the course of a few visits through his unique therapy, further visits made the pain practically non-existent. Also discussed and identified the root cause of the problem, which up until seeing the Dr. had been unknown.  Thanks, Dr. Donatelli!  I highly recommend Dr. Donatelli to anyone and everyone. Great guy and more importantly gets results!
5 Has done an excellent job with my lower back pain. Slipped out of position stretching and after a few visits feeling much better.  Thank You Great job
5 I decided to switch Drs this year for my annual exams and I'm so glad I did! I called many offices and this one stood out from the rest! Making the appointment was fast and easy. They also send you text reminders which I think is great. Upon arrival the staff greeted me with a smile and I instantly felt comfortable. I waited maybe 10-15 mins at most. Switching from a female  to male doctor, I was feeling a little nervous but Dr. Lopez was nice, attentive and gentle! They sent my prescription straight to my pharmacist which is so convenient. I will definitely be returning and recommending Dr.Lopez & his staff to my family and friends.
5 Front desk staff awesome! Sharniece my hand therapist amazing and her assistant Crystal just as wonderful.  I was in a vehicle accident in Mexico caused some damage to 4 of my fingers on my right hand. I was told by my doctor that I may not get any movement back on my fingers.  The entire injury was  horrible but I was able to find my recovery process very satisfying.  Therapy is not fun but Sharniece was excellent and I actually enjoyed all my visits. I went there 3x's a week for 5 months straight.  I did everything Sharniece asked me to do. It took some time but I was able to get all my movement back on my right hand.  I will recommend this place to anyone.  Forever grateful!
2 I was in search of a speech therapist to work with my child. I went down and spoke with a very friendly lady and she told me the people I needed to speak with had already went home. She took down all of my information and I left there feeling positive and looking forward to taking my child there. Three days later and not one call. Just disappointed by the customer service to someone who was really looking forward to becoming one of their customers. Oh well.
2 Doctors and nurses are great. Administrative staff still not so much. Had an annual physical scheduled and was told over the phone that my tests would be done by a nurse and then I would see the doctor. The receptionist on the phone was courteous and professional, a nice change. The phone wait time is still long though they have changed their offline hours to reflect what Diana N. had responded to my last review. However, that was NOT the case when I made the review.  I arrived 10 minutes early for my appointment and checked in via the terminal as all the signs stated and since the receptionists ignore you. The terminal told me my appointment was actually at another time, 30 minutes later. I figured I had gotten it wrong and just went to grab a coffee. About 10-15 minutes later I receive a call from the doctor's office saying I was late for my appointment. Apparently if you have an appointment with a nurse it does not show up on the terminal. The one they require you to check in on and there are no signs to indicate any different. Huh? And somehow, according to the receptionist, I should've known and it was my fault I was late and now they would have to rush me.  The receptionist reiterated it was my fault when I got back. I was pretty confused. The nurse, unlike the receptionist, apologized for the confusion several times. She was the one to explain that the system only shows the appointment with the doctor and agreed it was a very strange system. She was really great and went through everything with a lot of care despite us being short on time.  I've heard that poor administrative staff is a common issue at any doctor's office in Toronto. A damn shame because it turns people who need medical care off from going to the doctor's since they have to deal with such rude people as the front line staff.  The doctors and nurses are wonderful and that's the only reason I'm still a patient here.
1 Integrative health team- my ass. I originally saw Dr. Sindy Shin for Naturopathic medicine. Her hours were not compatible with my schedule and if the receptionist and Dr. Shin hadn't followed up with me, I would have stopped going.  I was rebooked with Dr. Yew. Skeptical, I said I really don't want to waste any money going over things I had already gone over with Dr. Shin. The receptionist explained that she would take off right where Dr. Shin left off. I mentioned that I was tight on money and would like to do everything in a half hour (Dr. Shin was always respectful of my time). The receptionist said not to worry, and she would tell Dr. Yew that, but it "may" need to be an hour.  Other than having the personality of a doorknob, my appointment with Dr. Yew was an hour and a half. I went over the exact same things with Dr. Shin (from my current vitamin supplements to checking my reflexes). The only thing I walked away with was a web print out of foods from the paleo diet. Her advice/ instructions: eat more vegetables and less wheat. Groundbreaking information right there. When I pressed her for answers, few were given.   She recommended 2 homeopathic sprays that were around $90 all together. That is absolutely outrageous. The most intolerable aspect was that they charged me for the full hour and a half. When I stood my ground and said that I had only agreed to an hour- they said too bad (even after I said I would never return).   This place is a money grab. The care is questionable and certainly doesn't live up to its mission. Highly disappointed
5 I was absolutely wow'd by my experience at Ethos. Here's the story.. I had just gotten back in town and felt like I was getting sick... Had ZERO time to be sick.. and I am the type of person who tries to find natural ways to maintain my health. Dr. Matt was able to accommodate my crazy schedule and get me in last minute and at the end of the day. He had awesome advice, and unique options for treatment. Part of the treatment included acupuncture, which I had never tried before, and LOVED! He also made me a tincture to help boost my immune system. In short, I love the individualized care I received and the fact that they cared enough about me that they were able to get me in the office same day. I would highly recommend them! Professional, Caring, and great at what they do!
5 Went in for a pulled leg muscle.  The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable.  They have a large therapy room with a lot of sports specific equipment.  They were thorough in examining my leg and even noticed my ankle hadn't healed right from a break 15 years ago.  I would highly recommend them to anyone in need of PT.
1 Decent nurses and clerks, Incompetent, impatient physicians. Do not waste time here.  It has been over a week and a few previous hospitol visits for what I thought was a foot fracture. I've had fevers, extreme joint and muscle pain in my back, neck, hips, fingers, and particularly, my foot. I can barely move.  I got in very quickly to see the nurse, hardly any wait. The tall male nurse was extremely comforting and patient with me, he said he could tell I was in a lot of pain. Then it took an hour for the doctor to see me. He was a short old Asian man who barely spoke english. He never bothered to read the nurse report but asked me what was wrong. I began to mention the foot pain, but couldnt finish, he intrrupted and immediately diagnosed me with gout. I asked, "does that explain the fever too?". To which he replied "oh, you have a fever?" I tried explaining all of my symptoms but he continued interrupting me.  I was finally able to get a word in and mention the pain peeing and sore throat. He examined my throat finally then he reluctantly gave me a urine test, ignoring my request for a blood test.  Had I not been adamant I would have left not knowing I also had strep throat, a bladder/kidney infection, AND the supposed gout. What a horrible doctor. I also overheard some of the staff bantering about the most random things, as well as complaining about us visitors who have no insurance... all the while as I waited.
5 I woke up one day with shooting pain in my neck that scared me.  I had never really had back problems but this time I could tell something was not right.  I tried several chiropractors in the area but was less than impressed.  Thats when I went on yelp and found Dr Steve. First thing he did was take xrays and immediately diagnose a level 2 degeneration in my neck area.  Went to 2 others who never even did an xray.  I was in quite a bit of pain and may have needed surgery if it was not for Dr Steve. After about a month of regular adjustments the pain is gone and my posture and neck alignment are much improved.  He is so positive and his personality is contagious.  In my opinion he is the best chiropractor in town and it is not even close.  I really believe if i had not found him when i did i was headed for surgery.  I can not thank him and his staff enough for what they have done for me.  I would give him 6 stars if they were available.
2 Tried to schedule an appointment today as a new patient because I broke my hand in a motorcycle accident, and was turned down. Receptionist said they take one new patient a day and as of 6/14 they are already booked until July. What? No sense of urgency.
1 This clinicis is by far the worse! The adult dr. Jeanette cruz Is a rude young girl that clearly hates her job, one of the nurses had a tatoo of a teddy bear on her neck how trashy is that!!? and to top it off they all are over weight...i dont understand how you are in healthcare and you obviously dont promote health! They have another clinic in maryvale that a family member has gone to and she mentioned that dr. Jeanette cruz cursed and talked negatively about another patient and their diagnosis. This young lady is so unprofessional and does not care about quality patient care!!! I do not recommend it!
5 Wow. I just had my first appointment for physiotherapy. I am very impressed with everything.
5 Angelo is a great guy. He is informative and knows what he's doing. I'm a young athlete who goes to Angelo to release inflammation and recover faster. There is no other cryotherapy I would go to.
5 I came to Step Up because I was experiencing lower back pain and wanted to see a chiropractor. I was treated by Dr. Jacky Leung and after a few visits I'm happy to say my back pain is gone. I find some chiropractors to be very pushy but Dr. Leung is very professional and I definitely recommend him to everyone that's looking for chiropractic treatment.
1 If I could give this place negative stars I would give them -5 stars!  If you care about your loved ones don't let them get sent here!  I do not even know where to begin.  Although some staff were caring and thoughtful, over-all the staff is hostile and aggressive to family and patient if you ask any questions.   The majority of staff have no understanding of patient bill of rights and right to know. My father has been here for 5 weeks and we have spent three weeks trying to get him transferred to a better facility. They have not been treating/cleaning his bed sore after he uses the bathroom, the nursing staff do not respond to his requests to assist him to go to the bathroom, in fact his call light was out for three or four days in his new room.  They didn't even notice, I had to bring it to their attention and request it be fixed. The Dr's change all the time, there is no adequate integrated case management or treatment plan, which means the Doctors do not know what is going on with the patient, as far as patients progress, physical therapy, occupational therapy etc.  Staff do not review patient history, example: my father has extreme and chronic back pain for over 12 years, they were not giving his pain meds prior to physical therapy and then they would not complete session because he was in pain... Also they do not read the case to impliment changes in patients condition.  My father passed his barium swollow test on a Monday and up to the following Friday, one and a half weeks later despite our protests and the speech therapists recommendations, the nurses were still ordering all his food be mechanically softened.  When we asked for a social worker, none were available for over a week. When we asked for a patient advocate it took days to get one. When we asked for a transfer to a more intense physical therapy center we were denied, based on PT notes that were two weeks old. When we demanded a meeting with all pertinent administration regarding our grievances we were treated well and they acted like this was a big surprise to them and were very apologetic. They decided to retrain staff and too impliment every one of our requests through Dr's orders.  So we were put in the position of having to tell them how to do their jobs, this is not only unprofessional but untenable.    Every patient has the right to know what medications they are receiving and what they are for and what is their treatment plan, the family has the right to know how their family member is being treated yet we were forced by staff to produce a POA form.    I have left out many things, but these are the main issues.  If we had not had a family member on site every single day for up to 8 hours my father would not have received the care he needed medically or for physical therapy.  I am disgusted and disturbed by this facility.  No patient or family should ever be put in the position we were put in.    Horrible Horrible Horrible.
4 Came to this location for my blood work.  It was easy to find, plenty of parking, no waiting, and it was super quick and PAINLESS!  In and out, in less than 5 mins.  The staff was very friendly and nice.
4 Close to home and with my busy life the b-shots really give me that extra boost to keep me going.  These ladies are great and always easy to get in and out :)
5 I love coming here and seeing all these wonderful people who work here! Even after my treatment is finished I will for sure be coming here still just to see my favorites MISS KAT & ANGELIC! They're absolutely amazing!
5 Great great place!  My family has had experience at several rehabs over the years, this was the best by far!  Great therapist, great staff!  Ethel who is often at the front door was welcoming, and very helpful, a great asset!  Toby in the dining room is beyond AMAZING!  He makes everyone feel special, and my mom loved seeing him everyday!   Thanks everyone for all you did to help my mom!
5 New patient & really was very happy. I am seeing Dr. Tartaglia & her & her medical assistant were so kind & thorough. I felt like they both really took the time to get to know me, ask questions & understand. I would definitely recommend this office based on my positive experiences.
2 Quick Care is a deceptive title for a place that makes you wait for 2 hours.  45 minutes I waited just to get called up to the counter to complete paper work.  Another hour was waited just to get called to the back.  A further 15 minutes were waited between getting my vitals checked and when the doctor finally showed.  The 5 minutes spent with the doctor was the quickest part of Quick Care.  I knew what I was getting into when I went in but I didn't know what other options I had.  I was feeling terrible and I was afraid I was coming down with pneumonia.  I would have gone to my primary doctor but his office was closed this week for the holidays.  So Quick Care it was.  At least I was given a z-pak, a new inhaler and some decongestants for my ailment.  And I am feeling much better now thanks to all that.  But getting there was a terrible experience.  I am not a people person and there are too many people at a quick care who have a knack for getting under my skin.  I mean patients not staff.  Just wanted to clarify.  The staff was actually pretty alright.  They are friendly and a few of them were making rather sorry jokes.  They may have been lame but I appreciate the effort.  At least it provides for a relaxing atmosphere in an otherwise stressful situation.
1 Unfortunately, I have not had much of a great experience with this doctor. I came in to get my labs completed as a requirement for graduate school. At the appointment, I brought in the paper that listed the labs to be completed. When the results came back a few labs that were required on the documentation were missing. I understand that these things do happen, so I returned to the office to see about doing another test to obtain these values. When I met with the doctor he asked me why I did not mention this before and to not assume that these labs should be completed, even though the documentation provided initially asked for these values. I was dismissed with him telling me "I was wasting his time" as he wrote an order for me to complete the labs elsewhere. I do understand that these mistakes do happen, but did not expect the doctor to tell me I was wasting his time as I did not come to blame him for his mistakes, but was met with defensiveness anyway. Other times he has been kind and has was helpful with answers, so I was not expecting this on my return visit.
1 Haven't been able to get in to see a speech therapist because apparently they have a new system and it's going to take a week to input my child into that system. Pretty irritating actually. Why on Gods green earth does it take over a week to input someone the system?
1 This place is completely frustrating. My family and I go to this office because it is nearby to our house and we like Dr. Wade and a few of the PA's that work in the office. Sadly, that is not enough reason for me to continue going here.  EVERY TIME I have tried to schedule an appointment with this office I am on hold for 20+ minutes. It never fails. If you are able to get ahold of an actual person, by some miracle, then they are usually rude. Not only that, but you most likely won't be able to schedule an appointment for weeks out. SO inconvenient... Not to mention if you make an appointment and end up in the office, everyone has a bad attitude. NOT good.  I will be trying out a new office for my next doctor's appointment...Good riddance.
1 This place is horrible! I went for a physical, waited 35 minutes in the lobby when there was nobody in line before me. The MA didn't take my BP, height or weight or do my EKG she told me she was going to do. I was embarrassed to be a Banner employee
1 Called to schedule an appointment and was greeted by a girl who obviously does not want any more business, she asked questions that only a PT could answer. After a 10 hour flight I needed something to work out the pain in my lower back, I have insurance but was more than willing to pay cash. she stated that they could not help me, then put the phone down.
2 I haven't had the best experience here. The receptionist isn't the nicest. I got a new family doctor here but she never seems to remember me, and always asks the same questions, then looks through her notes and says "oh right, I already asked you that." She suggested that I do an ultrasound, then forgot that she suggested that, so I brought it up and she actually asked, "why did I suggest that again?" ummm...you're the doctor??  I remember at the end of one of appointments, after completing a test, she said: "you should do this every year. you can even come back here if you want." ...isn't she supposed to my GP? They also don't schedule appointments on the same day, even if a time slot is available... which is weird?
1 I only go to the ER if I absolutely HAVE to. And the only reason I went to this one is because I live down the road & knew I would need to have an MRI done, which smaller clinics are not equipped with. This visit reminded me of why I dislike hospital ER's.   I went in because I hit my head on the bottom of the pool & lost consciousness two days prior. I felt I was fine until I got double black eyes & the swelling on my skull increased around the wound area where it split my head open. Increasingly worse head pain & dizziness was making me worry the extent of the injury may be internal. The purpose of the visit was to make sure I did not have a skull fracture or internal bleeding... The brain area is not an area to ignore!  The initial check in was quick. I was taken back within 15 minutes. But that's when it all started to go down hill. Yes, I said my pain level was an 8-10 being as how my head was swollen and hurting worse than a migraine. No, I was not "shopping for drugs". Because that is exactly the way I was treated. Before they even would hear my explanation/worries or bother to do anything- they made me take a UA, screening for drugs like I was some kind of a junkie looking for easy meds. That was wrong and really made me think twice about their "care" and practice. I asked WHY I had to take a UA for a head injury- not that I had anything to hide or worry about- but it struck me as stereotyping, and I was right when the nurse explained, "because we check random patients" which basically meant: we stereotype based on your looks & age to assume you are a junkie. There was absolutely no reason I should have had to have that slapped onto my bill, or wasted my time with that when I came in for a head injury.   Obviously the results came back clean. And from there it took 8 entire hours just to get an MRI and the results back. With only one other patient admitted. So it is not like they were swamped.   What really upset me, was that the nurse came back 2-3 different times with different medications and told me to take them. 0 explanation of what they were and why I was taking them. When I asked (because I don't just pop random pills someone hands me without knowing WHAT I am ingesting and WHY) she spit out a jumbled & mumbled "it's for this that & the other just take them!" Not okay with me. So there should have been no reason for anyone to get uppity with me when I politely declined to take a hefty amount of what they said was "vitamins" and "blood pressure" pills. That is not the reason I came in. At least after about 5 hours someone came back with an ice pack for my head...   The only good part of this visit was the technician who performed the MRI. He was very kind, friendly and caring. I was appreciative of his efforts to make me comfortable and he made me feel a bit better for that short amount of time.   The results came back as a hairline skull fracture. I'm glad it was not worse. But instead of instructing me on how to care for the wound or help it heal at home- I was rushed out to reception to pay the hefty bill and told "take Tylenol." Gee... Thanks for caring?   The check out receptionist was also very pleasant. I feel bad for them having to be in that position where they genuinely care and talk to you/show you they do, but then have to tell you the scripted spiel of "give us your money now- if you pay in full within 7 days we will discount your bill by 10% of the total balance." Wow...   So I basically paid for a bunch of doctors/nurses to make assumptions, treat me like a drug addict, disregard my concerns & pain/comfort then demand I pay for some of the worst medical "care" I have ever gotten. I feel like I am basically paying for an MRI and sitting on their patient bed for 8 hours while they didn't care.   I would not recommend visiting this ER if you can help it. Not that other places are better, but I probably won't ever go back unless I am rushed in by ambulance or my life depends on it. The only thing they did well was a prompt check-in, finally handing me an ice pack, and two friendly staff members. Also- don't bother to check-in online. I did that prior to visiting and the receptionist disregarded my confirmation number and pretty much said "you still have to check-in here, fill out all the paperwork and wait." So... What is the point?? This place could use some drastic improvement. Especially treating their patients better, not judging/assuming & taking some actual CARE.
1 I'm new to the area and I was trying to contact the office to find out if they accept new patients, can't even get thru to the receptionist and there is no option to speak with the front desk - I will find another doctor
5 Just left this place. I called ahead and was told the wait would be about 15 minutes, and that was fairly accurate. The doctor I saw, doctor Randall (Randy) was great. Can't remember the last name. He immediately gave me something for my nausea, explained to me why I was feeling so extremely dizzy, and wrote and filled my prescription on site. He was a kind of east coast, straight to the point kind of guy. In any case, I wasn't there long and they solved my problem.
4 The office is very small and set up kind of weird but it's nice and personal. I didn't love how they took my private information in the waiting room, I would have rather wrote everything down. That's private. No one else needs to hear my ssn or my symptoms.   The doctor was great and thorough and didn't seem to be in a rush at all like most other doctors.   They were able to do my blood drawing right there in the office which was great!   I'll be back but I hope they change their intake policy to be a bit more private.
1 I'm in tears from having the worst hospital experience of my life. I came into the ER because are used Monistat for what I thought was a yeast infection and experienced such intense burning and itching that I was in tears and screaming. When I told my nurse I was in for vaginal itching, she straight up laughed at me, Gave me a Benadryl, and said I don't know what else the doctor can do in a condescending voice. The doctor did a vaginal exam and after I waited over an hour for my results... Keep in mind it's 3 AM in the ER is basically empty... They discharge me, Charge me $100, and get this: The doctor prescribed me Monistat. The same cream that cause the itching burning, screaming pain that brought me to the ER. and when I asked if I had tested positive for yeast infection, they said they don't test for yeast infections. I have never been so infuriated in my life. Basically I was in screaming crying pain and they treated my case like a joke, didn't even bother to figure out what was wrong with me, and then prescribe me the same thing had brought me to the ER.
5 Today was my second time visiting Zen. Once again I left feeling super relaxed and most importantly, the knots in my back and neck..gone! Ashley was my therapist today. I will definitely try and request her, my next visit.
5 Great chiropractic office with great service!  Flexible, caring staff and Dr that go out of their way to help ease the pain. Highly recommend!
4 I had a wrap done on the recommendation of a friend who had it done recently.  I did not have super high expectations as I am in the medical field and I know that physiologically you cannot just permanently wrap weight away. I guess I just went figuring it was only $20 and I could relax for an hour.  Everybody was very friendly and when getting the process explained to me it certainly felt like the girl had said this several hundred times. Some of the claims are a bit of a stretch in my opinion. Again, I was not going in there expecting miracles or a medical procedure. After I changed into appropriate wrap garments, I was measured. The girl did not make me feel uncomfortable at all even though I know I could stand to lose 20 or so pounds. Then the wrap process began.  I can't say for sure whether the ace wraps were being soaked in some special herbal combination, however, they were warm and clean and she applied them with some degree of skill. She asked me what areas I wanted to focus on, I told her, again she did not make me feel uncomfortable and just wrapped me a little tighter and with a few extra reps in those areas. Once all was said and done I was led into the relaxation room, sat down and just kind of chilled for about an hour. As someone stated earlier, yes, the relaxation chairs are dressed up poolside lounge chairs... But who cares, the procedure is relatively inexpensive compared to normal salons or spas.  If someone wants a fancy and luxurious spa experience while getting wrapped, then they should probably go to a fancy luxurious spa. This place was clean, the staff was friendly, and pretty much did what they said they were going to do.  Now for the wrap itself.  Again, I know that this is not some permanent solution or medical procedure that's going to magically melt away inches and pounds forever. And again, I have no idea what those ace wraps were soaked in. I did however lose 10 inches overall after my first treatment. I was watching very closely when she measured me. I could visibly see a difference, my skin was a little tighter and everything looked a little smaller all over. Now do I think this is mostly water weight and things will come back to normal if I don't change my lifestyle... Sure. But would I get this wrap before a special event or if I have to wear a bathing suit... Absolutely!!!  I don't think I cleansed myself of some major toxins by getting wrapped up in a ace wraps for an hour but I can certainly say that I looked toner and felt pretty good about myself after all was said and done. So I guess I would say that this place exceeded my expectations because I really wasn't going in there looking for a couple hundred dollar spa treatment. I did not feel pressured to purchase any packages. I will definitely do it again. My advice is to have fun with it, maybe do it with a friend, don't go in expecting miracles and you won't be disappointed.
1 On time for our appointment.  Jackie was the doctor.  Waited 25 minutes in room to see my husband.  He had a CAT scan three weeks prior and we wanted to get the results.  She didn't even know why we were there.  She was rude and got irrate with us regarding our asking too many questions about our current concerns.  She spewed off to us about the fact that she had three patients waiting and needs to spend only 15 minutes with us so she can see other patients.  She mentioned something about the fact that she is only supposed to work till 6pm (it was 5:40 when she made that remark).  This office overbooks and Jackie has a horrible bed side manner.  She litterly was yelling at us at the end of our visit.  We were stunned and felt like walking out.  We expressed our feelings to the nurse and said we would never be back!
5 I have had chronic neck, shoulder arm and hand issues for over 20+ years from working on a computer.  I have tried almost everything to relieve the constant pain.  I watched over time how Eric Bloom, PT helped a co-worker who used a cane be able to walk again without the cane.  I was so impressed that I also went to see Eric Bloom who is the Clinic Director. He is so knowledgeable and more than just a PT.  He really cares about his patients.  He does something that I have never heard of before called "Dry Needling" .  I found relief immediately.  Dry Needling is the only procedure that has helped relieve the huge knots in my neck and the arm and hand issues. The Dry Needling does not hurt.   I would highly recommend Eric Bloom and the Dry Needling procedure.
5 I've been to many chiropractors, and by far Dr. Mike is the best! The entire experience is much more than the "get them in and adjust them" mentality. They are top notch full service here!   My upper ribs seem to pop out from time to time, and I usually go to The Joint to get them back in... but I was looking for something a bit more. And, I found it at Cas Chiropractic with Dr. Mike and his team.  See, after an intake where Dr. Mike actually listens and cares about what's going on in your life, he had his team start on my back with some gentle vibration therapy, massage and heat. By the time he adjusted me, I was so relaxed and my body at ease, that the adjustments were extremely gentle and way more effective than ever before. My muscles were ready for the adjustment, and they were not going to pull things out of place again... like they usually do.  Thing is, when I walked out of the office, I felt like I had had a massage, a talk with a good friend, and an awesome adjustment. My body felt awesome! And, best part is, I didn't have to ice, and I was not sore at all! I couldn't sleep or breath deeply for the entire 24 hours prior, since my ribs had slipped... so you can only imagine how great it was to be not only fixed, but feel even better than before.  We talked about working on strengthening the muscles that would help the ribs stay in place (not sure if I'm saying it right), but I know Dr. Mike and his team know their stuff and will take great care of me and you!  I'm bringing in my 5 year old next... he really needs care and I know Dr. Mike is the person to give it. Dr. Mike even has 4 kids of his own, so whether you need treatment or your kids do, look no further... you've found the best at CAS with Dr. Mike.
2 I stayed at this facility for 3 weeks in 2014. I am awarding 2 stars to recognize that I did receive excellent care from the nurses aides and 3 of the nursing staff.   There were many issues I experienced that I believe are sub par this inpatient facility. The issues include: use of some therapy facilities by non patients, over crowding in the therapy room and lack of equipment needed, the dispensing of medication protocol, a drug interaction miss by pharmacy staff which resulted in a 48 hour detox.  The worse part of my experience was the head nurse in my unit. She was the most miserable person I have ever encountered. Not only was she a miserable person, she made everyone else miserable too. My room was across from the nurses station and I was appalled by how she spoke and treated the other staff. I cringed when she responded to my call for assistance. I and my family were going through a very scary and uncertain time and this woman was unable to show compassion or caring.
1 DO NOT BOOK YOUR APPOINTMENT HERE!!!!  I've had the worst experience with them. I don't even understand how they are still in business. I've had to call multiple times in regards to prescription refills and they still will not have it done. I was then told that they will call me within a week in regards to a referral, but that also never happened. I decided to go see them again about six months later for a prescription refill and was told again that they would call me within a week about my referral. Not to my surprise, they failed again. I called them back to express my frustration and let them know not to bother going forward with my referral and that I would find a specialist myself, all the receptionist said was "okay... Okay bye." I do not recommend this clinic at all. Save yourself the stress and find a better clinic to go to!!!!
1 Haven't seen a doctor here yet, just sitting in the lobby. wait time is ridiculous...I'm starting to wonder if I'm still sick.
5 I finished with them 6 months ago and continue to follow the guidance given in the way out. I am in so much better condition with respect my old injuries that I continue to recommend the business and in particular Craig.  If you have long term back issues, this Nordic technique Craig uses and his patient technique my really help!
5 This doctor's office is AMAZING!! I always see Dr. Collins but have seen others when I'm sick and she's booked.   Not only are they speedy (10 minutes or less in waiting room) but the front office in general is very capable and helpful when any insurance issues have come up. Dr. Collins really cares about you as a person and your overall health and even calls with test results if it's anything out of the norm (or even if I was just a little worried about them).  She also is very personable and non judgmental when I tell her the truth about how many cocktails I indulge in on a weekend - although she continually tries to encourage me to stop having 6 cocktails on a Friday night  I also feel like I can tell her the truth without feeling like I'm in the Principal's office.   Best part by far is when I didn't have health insurance for a few months between jobs they were super accommodating with my cash pay situation, didn't rip me off, and cared enough to tell me exactly where to go for cheaper med prices and weren't so far into in the drug companies pockets like most doctors to insist on pricey meds or name brand medications.  p.s. Dr. Collins doesn't accept new patients but if you call and ask her medical assistant they usually can fit you in...
5 I've been coming to Camelview physical therapy now for quite a few years. December 10th I decided to try a different physical therapy and to my amazement not all physical therapy locations do the same thing. Since I returned back to Camelview physical therapy and when working with Linda Johnston,  I have found that she has made me a better person and now I can walk without using a cane and I feel better about myself in the long run. I just hope that linda continues to make people feel good with her staff and with her hands.
5 We love this place. I was just looking for the phone number since I got a new phone and saw the bad reviews. After reading some I realized they don't fully appreciate/ understand the nature of chiropractic care. My husband and I both made the decision to make our health a priority. We need several times a week for quite a while. It was an investment in time and money and years later we still agree it is one of the best health choices we have ever made.  Thank you Dr. Bock we appreciate your ability to keep going in a world that continually talks bad about  your practice of medicine that they don't understand nature sometimes takes time to heal years of abuse and neglect.
5 Love the office, doctor is fantastic and so is the rest of the staff...fantastic customer service!
2 I was initially looking for a primary care physician and thought I would try these people out.  I saw Lori Hardacker.  They will not perform a wellness exam without first seeing something requiring a diagnostic.  So I had to come up with something and figured I would get a mole checked out and some tests run.  This was the first red flag.  The entry is not welcoming at all.  It was crowded due to obvious overbooking.  When I finally got in to see the PA, I told her what the issues were.  Her examination made me feel uncomfortable as she was clearly uncomfortable seeing a male.  I was then sent across the street for a blood test in another building.  All I wanted was a physical and to establish a primary care physician.  I ended up feeling uncomfortable the entire time and was billed as an diagnostic outpatient - ie the insurance company will not cover as preventative care.  I will not go here again and will attempt to find an alternate place for a primary care physician.  As there are many different options to choose from, I doubt that I will have a problem finding a physician better than the experience with Southwest Family Medicine.
1 Why isn't anyone talking about the bill? I saw the doctor for no more than 2 minutes, the exam consisted of a stethoscope on my shirt in one spot, and I received a prescription.  For this my insurance was billed $280, and I am told I owe $230 with the insurance "discount". Please reviewers tell us how much you were charged so people will have some idea before they go in what this is going to cost. It's shocking!
5 Diese Praxis ist toll. Ich war jetzt drei Mal aus unterschiedlichen Gründen hier und bin jedes mal sehr gut und kompetent behandelt worden. Dr. Klenk hat einen sehr kompetenten und ruhigen Eindruck gemacht (was auch auf die Stimmung in der Praxis abfärbt). Ich bin sehr gut beraten worden (und ich kann in so medizinischem Kram auch gerne mal neugierig werden). Die Stimmung ist wie gesagt ruhig und unaufgeregt, ganz anders als in anderen Praxen. Die Sprechstunden-Hilfen sind freundlich und sehr sympatisch. Meine Impfungen habe ich von ihnen bekommen und was soll ich sagen? Ich habe die Spritzen fast gar nicht gespürt ;-) Auch wenn ich hoffe, dass ich nicht so schnell wieder hin muss: ich werde trotzdem wieder sehr gerne hier her kommen.
5 Excellent massage from Cynthia!  She is skilled in a number of different techniques and has tailored my massage to my needs.  Great therapy!
5 I am very impressed with Pain Stop.  I'm been to several Chiropractors and pain management place for issues in my back. Pain Stop takes a "Full Body" approach.  Not just Chiropractic but a mixture of what works best for you.  You will love the staff at Arrowhead office.  They know how the right way to treat people.
1 I had to spend 2-1/2 days in the hospital (March 2017) due to a 104 temperature and not breathing well, and finding out I had an upper respiratory infection.  But from the time I first went into the hospital, through E.R., it was chaotic, and I had to tell the nursing staff several times about my chronic kidney disease so they wouldnt give me certain drugs or try to inject me with anything as it could cause my kidneys to fail immediately.  I got no rest, as they kept taking blood from me and poking me over and over again with needles leaving multiple bruises on my arms.  They tried pulling me into another room to do a CAT scan, but I pulled the plug on that just in time before they tried injecting me with dye after i repeatedly told them AGAIN about my kidneys.  I was in E.R. for 12 hours before they could get my fever to come down to normal, then admitted me to a room that I had to share with another person who had constant visitors, and again, no rest.  They wanted to change my meds I was taking because they didn't have my meds there, so I called my son to bring me my own meds.  They kept wanting to give me insulin after they fed me and made my sugar level rise, but I refused as it was just another ploy to inject me with drugs.  It took 2 days for the doc to come see me so I could get released.  And then, the woman that discharged me was extremely rude, but they couldnt get me out of there fast enough.  I went home feeling worse than when I went in.  and a day later found a huge rash on my back.  I thought hospitals were suppose to be sterile, but I found it to be very dirty.  I'm never going back there.  Absolutely horrible!!
5 Upon encountering issues with my knees and experiencing lower back problems, I self referred to an amazing Physical Therapist, Dr. Travis Nestlerode.  Having worked alongside him in a rehabilitation setting, I can attest to his high standard of professionalism and extensive background in research.  Dr. Travis was able to facilitate a thorough evaluation in my home which was extremely convenient! Additionally, he provided me with information to improve my body mechanics, posture and  a personalized strengthening plan.  I was also impressed with Dr. Travis' quick response to my inquiries and treatment needs.  I mean, who wants to wait a long time to get help when they are in pain?  He is a personable, down to earth person whom I am glad to know.  I will continue to utilize his services in the future.  You will not be disappointed!
1 Central Phoenix Office. This is the worst front office I have ever experienced in all of my medical visits. There is no follow up at all. Not pro-active to make sure medical records are there, insurance pre-authorization is done BEFORE your appointment. Even though I was satisfied with the doctor, the re-active and no follow up attitude frustrated me so much after three appointments I cancelled the future nerve ablation procedure. Too many other pain clinics to choose from.
5 Aya is absolutely awesome! I went in today at 1:00 pm with lower back pain and it is now 4:00 and I am pain free. I work in a hospital emergency room and I am constantly lifting and moving patients so my body takes a beating. I will definitely become a regular! Best massage ever!
5 The PTs at Tobler are very personable and knowledgeable. Steve has been a huge part of my recovery process and his assistants have effectively shown me the proper way to strengthen the necessary muscles to acheive my recovery. Very grateful for the positive experience and will always return to this facility in the future if physical therapy is ever needed! Thank you!
5 I cannot be happier with my decision to choose Cornerstone to start my long-term ankle rehabilitation. Anna Staruszkiewicz is the best physiotherapist I know out there. She is very knowledgeable, accommodating, and has a great balance of professionalism and interpersonal skills.  She makes sure you understand the nature of your injuries, prognosis, and goes over your treatment plan thoroughly. I always leave the session feeling great, and most importantly, full of new knowledge that I can apply in my day-to-day. My progression has been rapid, and Anna makes sure I am constantly challenging myself and comes up with new exercises. She addresses your concerns/questions which is very reassuring when you are recovering from a complex injury like me.  The front desk staff (Jennifer and Sara in particular) are also excellent - very friendly and always prompt in responses. You can tell this clinic is well organized and managed - always a good vibe when I come in. I would highly recommend this place if you are looking for a good overall experience with your treatment.
4 I had my ninth visit here this Friday April 8th, 2016 for my broken foot injury. The staff has been helpful from The Therapist Heather, assistant Jessica, To Heathers new replacement Arthur! They have all been helpful. B-Payne
5 These ladies are AMAZING!!!! Very professional and very helpful. After a horrible car accident and surgery to repair my shoulder, Dr. M helped me regain full movement in my shoulder and arm. Edith was an absolute darling for working with me and encouraging me. Thank you so much!!!!!
1 I wished I had come on here to read reviews prior to wasting my time. Between the lengthy office waits to dealing with a mean doctor not to mention an incompetent staff as well. Go figure, workers are only as good as their leader!   This review is for Noel Chamian. I was given an EKG test at his office and was told my heart beat was abnormal so he referred me to a cardiologist, who when I did go to see this cardiologist and given another EKG, he cleared me saying nothing was wrong with my heart beat! And yet he refuses to sign off on a clearance for surgery because I'm "defective"?!
5 I had the good fortune to be treated by Rowena Cua.  I have had problems with sciatica on my left side for years and couldn't get any substantial relief.  After my first session with her my left side felt much better and relatively pain free.  I saw her a few more times and was amazed at how much better I felt.  I was happy with the results but more than that, Rowena genuinely cares about you as a person not just as a patient. I know when she treated me she put her best into it because she wanted me to be pain free.
5 Dr Jensen is absolutely the most skilled and caring chiropractor in Arizona  He is very good at diagnosis and his technique is wonderful and effective As a physician I am good at assessing another doctors skill level and  I highly recommend Dr Jensen!
1 I wish I could give zero stars. This business needs to state in BIG, BOLD LETTERS on every single one of their website pages that they DO NOT accept any self-pay patients. (Unless of course you're getting Botox or a chemical peel, which according to website is to be paid with either cash or Visa/MasterCard).  Last night I spent time researching nearby healthcare clinics, and after visiting this practice's website, I thought it would be a great option to establish a relationship beginning with an overdue annual physical. I liked that I could make my appointment directly with a nurse practitioner, and that there seemed to be a focus on preventative healthcare and wellness.  I made an appointment online, was prompted to fill out all of my new patient paperwork online that included my entire health history, and received an email confirmation for my appointment.  This afternoon they called me and said they were canceling my appointment because I was SELF-PAY.  I was extremely upset and called back to inquire about my health history they now have and was transferred to the office manager. This man was rude and condescending, and tried to refer me to a low-cost community clinic, even though I can absolutely afford to pay for services.   I have NEVER had an experience like this before with a healthcare provider, and find it absolutely incredulous that this clinic purports to be all about prevention and wellness - but apparently only if they can pad it up and bill an insurance provider. What utter BS and all of the doctors and everyone else at this practice should be absolutely ashamed of themselves.  Sorry I didn't need Botox. I just wanted to make sure my blood pressure was okay and have my general health checked out. You obviously weren't great for my blood pressure today, and I'll find a nice clinic who actually walks their talk and will take my cash money.  You all completely suck and I'm appalled by your disgusting office policy. And I would also appreciate some sort of confirmation to ensure my health history has been erased/shredded from your system. Shame on you!
5 This place is great and I never met a more caring administration, management, and nursing staff!
5 I normally don't write post on yelp, But today I just had to speak out. I have been going here now for about two years. I have gotten nothing but amazing service every single time. The reason why today is a little different is,because today I was not feeling my normal happy-go-lucky self. Everything quickly changed when I walked in and saw Guia, Karina and Keisha's beautiful smiling faces. They immediately  brightened up my day. I will continue to come here as well as bring my family too thank you so much family Doctors of Greenvalley. Mostly thank you beautiful ladies.
1 Went to this office few months back and had informed Jennifer at the front office about getting x-rays done with another dental office and that insurance may not pay - asked her to double check on that. She said ok. Fast forward months after - with no cleaning or anything done just initial consult with X-ray - I am now being charged $200+ by a collection agency. Called Jennifer just now and she said we're giving you a discount if you can pay $100 instead   Stir clear of this office. Very deceiving.
5 My sweet daughter treated me to a massage for my birthday. My therapist, Samantha, was great, knowledgeable, and very personable. The prices are good and I will definitely return next time I'm in Charlotte.
1 This is the closest travel clinic to where I lived so I booked an appointment here. After sitting in the waiting room for an hour I struck up a conversation with the lady and her daughter sitting beside me. They informed me they had been there for 3 hours and were still waiting for a vaccine shot. I immediately left and booked an appointment with Passport Health downtown Toronto later in the week because it got good reviews online. At Passport Health there was literally no wait time. Don't even bother with this place.
5 I've been going to Aches Away Toronto since February 2011, and every time I've had a great experience.  Faz is very thorough with his work, and makes sure he has a total understanding of your condition before he treats your injury/discomfort/pain.  It is obvious he cares about his clients as he will follow up with you after treatments to make sure you're feeling better. I've also had times where I need an appointment right away, and Faz will fit me in as best as he can.   Faz is also very helpful in providing at-home exercises that you can try for strengthening your muscles or injury prevention.  I've recommended a few friends to him, and they all love his work.
5 Dr . Montoya is a wonderful doctor and all the ladies in the office are very helpful and nice and the office is very welcoming. Dr. Montoya has delivered all my  kids and he is great at making you feel comfortable and he is very helpful with anything you may need or want to ask. And love the music he plays in the rooms!
5 I received a referral to Mission Physical Therapy for pulled muscle in my lower back. Within 3 weeks I'm 100% better. In fact with the exercises they assigned me for my core I'm doing even better. They're very hands on meaning they don't pawn you off to a student, etc. Also, the staff is very friendly!
5 Seeing Dr. Coury today at his new Gilbert Clinic was very encouraging. Thank you Doctor for taking care of all my health issues. Ladies and Gentlement may I present Dr. Pete Coury. An excellent choice for a primary care doctor.
5 Adding Dr. Greenapple's office in it's new location, over McAllister's Deli at Park and Seneca (between Woodlawn and Selwyn).  Dr. Scott Greenapple is an incredibly excellent Doctor of Chiropractic.  Due to his continued care, and that of an excellent neurosurgeon to whom he referred me, I have had little need of his services in the past few years.  What better compliment for a chiropractor?!?  I truly suffered through disk/sciatic problems for too many years.  Dr. G. helped me through, and put me back together when I was broken.  When the time came for surgery, he didn't hesitate to refer me.  What makes Dr. Greenapple different from most other chiros is that he also specializes in soft tissue manipulation.  Google "Active Release Technique."  He was integral in my rapid, complete, and in my estimation, miraculous recovery from back surgery.  As I said, my reward to him is that I don't get to see him much any more, but I will always appreciate his skill and compassion.  Okay, now the bad news... he's REALLY good, and word has been getting around.  He's got a lot of athlete patients... some high profile.  It can be hard to get an appointment with him... unless you can schedule a couple weeks out.  Dr. G. has an associate, Dr. Mike Duffy.  He is also Active Release trained.  He's not Dr. G., (sorry, Mike), but you might be able to get in to see him.  I've seen Dr. Duffy most often for the occasional "glitch" in the past few years, and I can recommend him as well.  I am assuming he's still there, but  again, his excellent care means I haven't needed 'em much in the recent past.  :)
1 Omg!  This has to be the worst experience I've ever had in regards to taking a simple drug test that should have taken 15 min or less.  The wait was 45 minutes which is crazy.  My name is finally called and Ashlee can't find my company's name in the system.  Hmm this is weird.  So I asked her if I needed to call my place of employment.  She said no.  After 10 minutes, she calls someone on the telephone.  Wow! They give her the information that is needed.  10 minutes later she is still trying to figure out how to use the system.  Another lady comes in and solves the problem.    Apparently, the problem is 'user error'.    So by this time my bladder is about to explode.  I'm finally given the okay to fill up the cup.     Next, she prints out my copy of the paperwork and leaves the room to get the copies.  She comes back 2 minutes later and says that it would help if she clicked 'print.  Wth.. I finally receive the paperwork and am free to leave.
5 I have been a patient of Dr. Picarello for several years and he and his staff have been nothing but wonderful, professional and efficient. Thank you Mountain Park Chiropractic!!!!!
5 This Box is the same owner as Camp FitForce... They are now affiliated with their new name. ... And it is awesome! I have been in the Crossfit Scene since 2008... And have encountered a few great Coaches.... I have Done much Research to find the perfect Fit (due to a far move from my old box). And FINALLY I have found the PLACE!!!!!!

5 I have gone to Foothills Sports Medicine Physical Therapy for a few situations I had within the post 6 months or so.  I worked with both Jennifer and Jeff as my therapists.  They are both fantastic.  Loved the ASTYM and the Dry Needling.  The techs are all great as well; Ida, Lucas, Lucy and Gannon.  The front office staff are also very good and very helpful.  Thank you all again for all that you do to get us back in working order.
5 I love Dr. Wingard. He is always warm and responsive. He takes on all of my questions and respects me as a nurse. The only con can be waiting for the appointment because sometimes he is so busy you can't get in to see him quickly. He is an A+ doctor
4 Took my mom for her bday for her first massage ever, and she had a wonderful experience with Jasmine. She can't wait to go back! The place is very zen, and the staff is super friendly. Looking forward to making an appt for myself!
1 This place is terrible. I had been on waiting list to get a family doctor, and then finally did, in July last year. Somehow my doctor has now moved elsewhere, and all that the clinic told me was that my appointment was cancelled because the Dr moved -no alternative, no doctor replacement, no solution whatsoever. Really sub par service.  On top of that, the receptionists are generally rude, and the one who informed of these changes was particularly rude and unhelpful.  Over the last year, I've been to this place only a couple of times, my Dr was fine, but the staff in general isn't great, they keep you waiting for a long time (even for the supposed appointments).   So I'll be trying to find a different doctor in a different clinic, and will tell everyone I can to NOT go to this place.
5 Love this place , every tine I go see the doctors my heart rate goes up , feel bad , scared . This place , staff and my Doctor , Dr.Larson. Make a great experience every time   I walk in the door . . They truly care about you , go above and beyond the normal patient treatment . I never ever feel rushed , I get everything answered , I always get calls back .   If you haven't felt or found a great place to have your health check stop looking and come here .
5 Staff is friendly and appointments run on time. Dr. Bates explains plan of care in detail and adjusts the plan depending on physical  complaint.   Dr. Bates has excellent bed side manner.  My back and shoulder issues are resolving which I am grateful.
5 Everyone at Chandler Physical Therapy makes you feel like you're the only person there.   Eric is amazing and works hard to get you back at your best. Jenna and Jason make sure you are doing all your exercises  right and then email you instructions so you can refer back and make sure you're doing them at home right. I love coming here even though I wish I wasn't injured.
5 Dr Wasserman has been professional, kind, compassionate, and determined to help me feel better!  I recommend her highly!
5 I almost had my baby in the car on the way there... a nurse was on her break and she seen me getting out of the car screaming from my contractions she quickly grabbed a wheelchair from inside and right away I started seeing doctors and nurses rushing me to the delivery room... 20 minutes later out comes my baby girl... I didn't plan to have her there I was actually on my way to Summerlin hospital but I knew I wouldn't of made it... everyone was nice and seem so caring for both my daughter and me..
1 I feel like this is an overdue review, back in 2008 my grandmother walked into the quickcare center with a cold. My mother and grandmother were only expecting her to get antibiotics, and maybe a breathing treatment, but they were in for a real surprise. They said that they had to immediately admit her,  and she went directly to the ICU. Which would have been okay, because she had a pace maker. She was in there a week, when  they decided that they wanted to move her out of the ICU, because she was getting better, calling my mom and asking for permission which was great. My mom was relieved, and left to pick me up from school, and we went shopping. That all took about 2 hours, literally the second we walked into the house we get a call from them, stating that they had to put my grandmother back into the ICU on a ventilator. Now before that she was fine, talking to the woman next door to her room, being loud and playful. We get into the ICU, see that the woman (who was also doing great before) on a ventilator as well. Five steps into my grandmothers room to see that she has bruises on her bottom, hips, and elbows. She had been dropped, and when my mother and aunt confronted the nurse on duty, he denied it to the hilt. Skip to a few days later, and they over-dosed my grandmother, leaving her to pass once, my family literally had to walk through the ICU, looked down the hall to see a 200 lb man doing CPR, on my 90 lb grandmother (days before that the lady next door had died from the same thing). When we confronted the same nurse on duty, he gave my mother and aunt attitude stating that he didn't know what was going on, and seemed to give a care less. They then insensitively approached my mother with life-support forms, and pushed her to deal with it within the next following days. As time passes she ends up dying of an over-dose, and possibly some broken ribs. We got a call later after her passing, saying that they wanted $300 dollars a month out of my mother, because of the amount of equipment being used on my grandmother currently, assuming that my grandma was still alive, and told my mother that it had to be dealt with or they were going to (in my own words) take her to a cleaning. My mother then told the woman on the phone, that my grandmother died, and that she wasn't going to pay for anything, because the cause of death was in their favor. The lady then agreed, told my mother she will handle it, and then quietly suggested that she go to a specific attorney, because what had happened was their fault and it had happened frequently. If you have an elderly person that needs to go into hospital, or even just for a check up, DO NOT TAKE THEM THERE. Already 10 people that my mother had discussed this with had all said that their father or mother, aunt, uncles, whoever had the exact same thing happen.  DON'T GO THERE AT ALL. It is dangerous, and the nurses are extremely careless, and can sometimes be insulting.
5 I have been to Markham Health Network 3 times, once to see Dr Chopra in the dental office, and twice to visit the walk-in clinic. Both times I saw Dr Rasaratnam in the walk-in. For each visit I had a very short wait time. The office is beautiful, very modern and professional. There is a play room for the kids which is very helpful with a toddler, but we didn't get much chance to use it since they were so fast. Dr Chopra was very friendly and knowledgeable, and Dr Rasaratnam was very thorough on both occasions. I love being able to visit all of my health professionals in the same office and being able to coordinate visits. I was able to get in at the walk-in right after my dental appointment. There is also a massage therapist, chiropractor, physical therapist that I have not used but that section is equally well designed and professional. Parking is free too!
1 'DISMISSED' FROM CARE DUE TO THIS YELP REVIEW, AS PER STATED BY THE OFFICE MANAGER--BEWARE.  I've been there twice now and each time, I've just felt pissed, while I'm there and after.  I can't wait to leave.    The staff is varying degrees of snippy. They have these policies that are just not patient friendly--like they won't let me have copies of my test results without setting a 5-minute appointment to see the doctor.  Wow, talk about milking each and every penny.  I was already upset that I had pay Quest $140 on the annual exam and a test she really recommended that I have, even though I told her I had the same test years before and I shared the results with her.  So basically, even with insurance, I owed that much from the first appointment.  They basically made $200 to see me for 15 minutes.    I got through the procedure fairly painlessly and Dr. Docasar was a little more personable than our last appointment, when she told me my PMS symptoms could be worse and "wait til you get older."  Uh, right, but what about NOW??  Talk about being talked down to.    After the procedure, I bled and bled (over 24 hours), something I have never done after several same procedures in the past.  Don't know what that's all about.    To boot, I had to sit there and wait 20 minutes after my procedure in a room with the door open (so all the staff could see I was just.sitting.there) to have my blood drawn and then, they said they wouldn't release the results to me, I would either have to request them on my own from the lab or I would have to do (yet another) appointment with them (see paragraph #2).  Several days after the appointment, I get a message that the pharmacy called and "the medication that Dr. Docasar put it isn't carried anymore.  Okaaaayy?  Sorry."  She then thought to add her name and the office number.  And then hung up.  But how about something like this (customer service 101), "The pharmacy called and they don't have the particular prescription medication, so we looked up several alternatives and we wanted to run a few options past you, please call us to discuss, and then we will happily resubmit a different prescription."  At this point, I'm not even calling back, I'm just going to go back in to talk with these idiots in person.  Oh, and they are always trying to upsell cosmetic products and supplements.  This month is a "September special," whoowhoo, so of course anyone who wants their v***** checked and their botox done, this apparently is your place!  And Dr. Docasar told me twice about these really great supplements that will help with my immune system, and don't you know, she just happens to sell them??  This place is a joke, they must thrive on all the uppity women who chose to come here.  I can't wait to NOT return.  Ever.  Oh, and check out all the 'not recommended' reviews, there are several 1-stars in there.  Thanks again for the dismissal letter, somewhat-aggressive office manager!  Now, I don't have to come back for my 5-minute appointment!  Good riddance!   A decent medical practice would LISTEN to their patients, not 'dismiss' them.
1 Thanks to Obamacare, American quality healthcare is about to disappear. The people who own K/E simply pulled the plug and closed. Paul T Emery has been my primary care for over twelve years.A nice guy and a great doctor. As a senior with serious medical conditions to find that I no longer have my doctor is outrageous. Anyone can go bust; anyone can decide they want to close, but to leave patients like me in the lurch with no prior notice is reprehensible.The owners of K/E are assholes. They also have put the well being of many patients at risk. No warning, no records nothing.The office was always poorly run but my concern was with my doctor and his excellent nurse Julie. I was taken care of and so was my wife and one of my daughters. If anyone out there wants to sue these bums.......count me in. If anyone knows where the headquarters of this company is, we ought to go there and camp out in front of their door until they personally hand us our medical records and at no charge. They have been stolen from us.Hope that some attorney reads this.
4 I have been going here for years. At first it was only $39.99 for an 1 hour Swedish massage but their price increased to $45.99 last year or so. This is still very good compared to the $60.00 a hour at other places. So why do I like this place? Well, the price was what attracted me at first but I just got used to their service and location after a while. The place is not your typical spa; it is more on the casual side. Zen comprises of two houses painted orange on East Blvd (close to Kenilworth). The driveway is a little narrow but parking is never an issue. The place is decorated in an Asian theme and has around 4 or 5 rooms in the main house upstairs while maybe 6 rooms or 7 in the other house. They do have rooms for couple's massage but make sure to ask for the price difference because I was charged $10 extra. The rooms are comfortable most of the time but can be a little cold in the winter time.   Somethings I noticed that can be improved upon is the darkness of the rooms. The rooms can be bright at times; the shades on the windows are not completely dark and depending on which room you are in, sometimes you can hear the traffic and/or the doors closing and opening outside. As mentioned, during the winter times, it gets a little chilly in there.   I think I have tried every female therapist there over the years and it took a while to get someone I really like. I like a firm massage so Mary and Lisa are my favorite but Mary is no longer with them as of last month - she moved to California.  I have tried many other places and will continue to try different spa as I find out about them through deals or gift cards. BUT I must say that Zen will be my "home" massage place because I feel really comfortable there.
5 When she suddenly took a fall my MIL visiting from Brazil was seen by Dr Spencer & Adriana earlier this week. Very professional team. And her international insurance covered everything. What impressed me most was Kelley's (front desk) genuine concern for the situation even though she was inundated with patients at that time. Warm & friendly practice. Definitely recommend!
5 Highly trained staff that works well together in delivering efficient, personalized care to each patient.  The PT's on staff really get to know you - first as a patient; then as a person, to be able to optimize your recovery time and performance.  Everyone from the front office staff to the PT's are friendly and caring - I really enjoyed my time there. I came away from my rehabilitation process much stronger and in better condition than before I started!  I highly recommend Blankinship Physical Therapy to anyone in need of recovery from a sports, auto or other type of injury.
5 Dr. Ford & Mary McNinch (family nurse practitioner) are the absolute best. They are so smart & understanding, they never ever judge you, and most importantly, they truly care about you. They are two of the kindest people I've ever met. If you need a new Dr, go to them.
5 Great new patient visit Easy to book appointment  Seen quickly Answered my questions, asked good questions gave good clear detailed advice
4 I needed a new Primary Care doctor so I made an appointment to establish a new ongoing relationship with a new doctor.  This is the first time I've ever dealt with a medical professional in SC so I wasn't really sure what to expect.    The office was easy to find and it was clean.  I arrived the requested thirty minutes prior to my appointment to find an empty waiting room and an empty reception area.  I'm confused as it's 1:30pm on a weekday.  Then a lady comes out and tells me that they must have forgotten to lock the door because they're currently closed for lunch.?.  I tell her my appointment is at 2:00, and I came 30 minutes early as requested, so I'll be in the waiting area whenever they're ready.  I don't think that was the result she was after, but I wasn't going to sit in my car for another half hour when I had in fact met their own appointment arrival time requirement.      A few minutes later the receptionist calls my name and starts to give me the new patient forms when I stop her and tell her I've already filled them out, but I have a few questions.  I could see the color drain out of her face when she realizes I'm going to ask pointed questions about very specific lines found in their new patient paperwork.  Sure enough, she wasn't familiar with their paperwork and couldn't answer my questions.  She clearly got flustered and told me that I'd have to speak to their office manager who just left for lunch.  I told her that would be fine and we moved forward with my appointment.    The nurse that took me to the room and took my vitals was nice enough, though felt kinda glazed over in dealing with just another patient.  Her tone and body language seemed a little on auto pilot to me, but again, I didn't make an appointment because of the nurses, I made an appointment with FMFP to see a specific doctor, so I tried to remain optimistic.  When the doctor came in, it felt like I was Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz walking out of the black and white house out into the colorful Land of Oz...  The doctor was quick and on point and asked specific questions about my issue and listened to the answers.  The doctor was slightly hurried and curt, but I could tell they're simply a person that gets things done and doesn't spend their time with chatter, so I shifted gears and adjusted my tone to match theirs and we seemed to get along just fine after that.  The doctor listened to my issues, gave a quick physical examination then spun into action making me an appointment with an imaging center for the very next morning.      I do feel like I made a good decision in going to FMFP; I liked the doctor and felt like they had a lot of experience and would help get me to a solution.  The rest of the FMFP cast left a little to be desired, but nothing completely intolerable.
5 Dr Steve is the best and is willing to help you with all your physical needs from adjustments to even diet and nutrition tips. I like that walk ins are very much welcomed.  Love the staff at Global Chiropractic.
1 After 4 visits, I was billed double of what my insurance should've been billed. They owed me $30. I received a hill for $461. I called in September when I got it. They told me the billing reviewer would look into it. Got another bill in October and my insurance rep emailed and said I should be receiving a $30 check and bill was taken care if. November I received letter from a collection company. Called the collection company and was told to call ATI. I did and again was told my reviewer would look into it.  I got another letter from collection.  Called ATI and again was told my reviewer would look into it. This was now November. I was told my previous reviewer was not longer there. Talk about an incompetent company.
5 Great family atmosphere. Never make you feel like a number.  They made my recovery an easier experience.
5 Carling's plantar fasciitis treatment (ASTYM) works.  However, what I enjoy most is the way the Steve and his staff connects with me during my visits.  I care about community and Carling Physical Therapy does a nice job of making you feel part of theirs.  And  my foot feels better:)  Pretty sweet deal.
5 Excellent service and care by a well trained staff.  Dr. Tice is wonderful and is the reason I am getting back to normal and losing weight. Thanks for all of your help.  Scott
5 This experience was a really good decision. My initial impression was how immaculate the spa was and how comfortable the technician made me feel. I'm reactively new to this ,so having the level of instruction and education also helped ease my anxiety. I was guided through the e process with ease and comfort. I know that when I am traveling again to LV that this is going to be a regular on my to do list. Thank you everyone.....I physically felt so much better. So am telling myself I looked so much better. That works for me!
5 Atmosphere, cleanliness, high quality therapists, price, & evening hours are what keeps me coming back every month
5 I absolutely love this place! The staff here is amazing, friendly, and so helpful. Dr Cirelli has helped me through so many problems. From headaches, to foot problems and even neck problems. I do not know where my health and body would be without them. I cannot thank Dr Cirelli and his staff enough for all they have done for me!
1 I do forgive the long wait time, I don't mind the creepy look of the office. What's unforgivable is the cocky doctor and the demeaning way he talks to patients, getting visibly annoyed when asked for more explanations, cutting the conversation short by escorting me out, while discussing sensitive personal info in front of everyone, then milking my insurance for the maximum amount he could... Save yourself time, money, and a lot of frustration.
4 "My entire family have been with Dr. Guo's office since we moved to Vegas more than 10 years ago." Ah... sorry Sherry L. I just plagiarized your first line. This office holds the practices of Dr. Li Yee Guo (name in title is mixed up), Dr. Wei Feng Zheng, and Dr. Nancy Hsiao.   I have been seen at Dr. Zheng's office for.. when I'm sick with the cold, when I had acne, when I made the bad decision to do an 8lb pizza contest, when I had a rash, when I needed a sports physical, when I needed college shots, and when I needed antibiotics ASAP because it was finals week. They also have tons of samples to give you to save you $$$ at the pharmacy and manufacturer coupons for your brand name prescriptions.   Fortunately as well I have NEVER been let down by his referrals to specialist, or the amount of time he spends with me, or any of his nursing staff.   HOWEVER... the only thing keeping Dr. Zheng's office from being a glistening 5 stars is the wait time. They are extremely busy, and you will probably never see the office empty, so whether your on time, early, or even late for your appointment prepare to wait. Sometimes I'm not sure if the wait is longer for when you're in the patient lobby or inside the room waiting for the doctor.   Aside from my personal experiences I also have a lot professional experiences with this office. Rarely do I ever have problems with the prescriptions written from here because it is PRINTED on paper! MANY doctors in Vegas write as if their hands were replaced by chicken feet. Most request sent over to their office is responded in a quick manner, sometimes over the weekend. This means that this office is on top of their business increasing their overall credibility.
1 This clinic is horrible for customer service ... great doctors but nurses and reception are horrible. The nurses all have a chip on their shoulder; aren't friendly and really don't want to be there so don't do more than they have to do. We got a call from them to have a prescription called in to pharmacy ... we told them to call Shoppers and when we went to pick it up ... it wasn't called in - hours later ... when I called the next morning ... the nurse there said they didn't have the number to the Shoppers around the  corner ... and so they didn't call it in ... obviously didn't care to get on the computer they sit in front of all day ... to look it up ... not impressed and will not return to this substandard clinic.
5 Great and friendly place to be.. They take really good care of you.. They really listen to your concerns. I would recommend this place to anyone.
5 Dr. Adarmes and staff are very knowledgeable and helpful in the Federal Workers' Compensation process. He really takes the time to listen to your medical issues and explain what needs to be done for your injury.
5 When I first came to CPT I had issues with my right shoulder. I was paired up with Danny Z. and throughout my 4 weeks, he was able to alleviate almost all of my pain. All of the staff was incredibly helpful and friendly. It was very easy to make my appointments and I always got a time that worked well for me.   I am extremely pleased with the progress I was able to make in 4 weeks and I am so glad I found CPT on Yelp. I can see why the have great reviews and would recommend them to my family and friends. Thank you CPT!
5 I started coming here because I was looking for a good RMT in Toronto to treat my painful lower back and hip pain after doing some heavy moving and lifting some really heavy stuff.  I researched some more and made my selection of whom I'd make my appointment with: Ada. I booked my appointment for a Thursday morning and although I had a little bit of trouble finding it, I wasn't too late for my appointment.  I filled in my patient disclosure form and handed it to Ada, I did the 60 minute massage and it was amazing. She is so very pleasant, and she is a great conversationalist, you feel like you are talking with a sincere friend, not a hairdresser making random conversation. She was so nice, friendly and professional - she absolutely fixed my back, and answered all of my questions. I have since recommended the place to all my close friends and family. My boyfriend recently went to her too, and he also experienced the great level of service.   This place is great, and I am eager to book my next appointment!
5 Update 10/13/2015 I've been seeing Matt as my PT he's been here a few months came down from CA. I'm so happy he's here, he's amazing. Hi highly recommend Matt, I really feel like I'm making progress when he's working with me and when I leave there I can feel a difference. He doesn't leave my side until he knows I'm 100% doing exactly what I'm suppose to be doing correctly and even then it's only long enough to check on something or someone and he's back before in done and I'm never out of his sight. What physical therapy company can you honestly say you go to and they give you that kind of attention? You don't get a piece of paper with exercises to work off of here you actually get a PT working with you the duration of your visit, mine happens to be Matt and I'm so happy with him. I look forward to my therapy knowing I'm going to be having progress with my healing and he doesn't let me leave with out stretching me first, it feels so good to have my body stretched even though it hurts it feels good. My body really needed this healing, if I only get half of what I'm expecting it's still half more then what I went in there with. You have to try out Matt!!!    I had my consultation today with Don Nobis himself, it was 8:00 am when I arrived and 10:05 when I left. He went over everything with me I felt totally comfortable in knowing within the first 30 mins of our conversation that this man was very knowledgable and thorough. I absolutely believe that there is going to be some sort of relief that I will be walking away from his establishment with at the end of my treatments. I have the trust and faith that out of all the places I've been to this really is going to be the one that can help me on the road towards recovery. I'm ever so grateful to Dr. Bascharon for this referral, I've  searched for a year in half for help to release this pain from my body, I'm not expecting a miracle just happy to be here where Don Nobis actually has the knowledge to help me with a treatment plan and goals. So excited to get started!!!! Already referred a friend once she heard me talking about him and he got her right in.  I truly recommend that if anything at all you consult with him, he accepts insurance and cash pay. Very affordable !!!!
5 Great service here. My physical therapist really knew her stuff. She took time to read my chart and really cared about my progress. The therapy room is big and has plenty of tables. Love the office staff too. Highly recommended.
5 Found Dr Carroll through the reviews. Now using him as primary Doctor . I travel from MARICOPA to Chandler office. The Dr is totally a professional! I am very happy to have chosen him. Explains everything you ask and his manner is excellent. The office staff is pleasant  and professional. Everything they do there is 5 stars. Prescriptions are sent in immediately. Blood work and urine done in office. The office is immaculately clean. I have just found Dr heaven. Worth the trip no matter the mileage. Drs in MARICOPA are greedy and uncaring. Dr Carroll is as good as any New York Dr. Now I am set for the rest of my life. His online web site is top notch. Get everything including all results and appointments online. This place is TOP OF THE LINE DOCTOR CARROLL THE STAFF THE OFFICE AND INTERNET. Couldn't be happier to have found this oasis
1 Giving a star only because the chiropractor was decent. Twice my appointments got delayed by more than 15 mins. And while they charge 20 $ for late show / missing appointments, the receptionist were gruff and just shrugged her shoulders in response when I told her I am leaving. And i also noticed several dissatisfied customers having arguments. Please avoid going here if you can!
2 staff was friendly. but when i took everything into account, i can't say that i have a very high opinion of this place. it should have been cleaner for a med facility. if you aren't looking too hard, it may appear fine, but take a closer look and you can tell it needs improvement. if i see blood anywhere, and i did, i feel it's a failure.  the paperwork i received reflected only one symptom of the reason i showed up and the discharge paper explaining that one issue had really nothing to do with the actual problem. if this is part of intake/reception and they are not medically trained at all, they need to review personnel that may not have the detailed note taking skills necessary for the position.  also received an injection that was not noted on my paperwork. since i was advised to go to the er for further assessment and treatment with my paperwork, it seems like that would be an important thing to have notated. that could have been a major health and safety issue if something happened.
4 While I have not taken part in the services this center offers, I wanted to give a shout-out because they were cool enough to host a La Leche League meet here a while back. :)  Thank-you!  It's a little complicated to find their suite in the office complex so be sure to get precise directions before your appt!  Might see you there.
5 das sanogym ist perfekt für mich. durch einen unfall habe ich ein schädelhirntrauma. am anfang habe ich physiotherapie probiert. aber es ist schwer einen guten physiotherapeuten zu finden. ich brauchte keinen masseur sondern einen physiotherapeut. auf jeden fall habe ich das nicht gefunden. in ein fitnessstudio wollte ich nicht gehen, weil es auch nicht das richtige ist. das sanogym ist genau die perfekte mischung. sport und physiotherapie! das ist genau das was mein körper braucht und was das team vom sanogym mir gibt. ich habe das vibrationstraining. und auch wenn es nur 30 minuten dauert, reicht es mir genau aus. alle trainer tun ihre sache aus leidenschaft. ich habe das gefühl das sie mir helfen wollen und nicht nur mein geld kassieren. es ist sehr angenehm dort zu trainieren. ich werde dort als mensch behandelt und nicht als mensch mit handicap. jedes training ist anders und individuell. auf meine wünsche und das aktuelle körpergefühl wird eingegangen. auch wenn es irgendwo zieht oder weh tut, nichts wie hin. ich trainiere dann was anderes oder nicht so heftig. egal bei wem. alle sind super und das training ist bei jedem trainer effektiv! die trainer sind jung, sehr engagiert und profisionell. alles in allem  TOP!
5 I'm from Tucson, so I wasn't exactly excited about being sick in another city. This was the closest urgent care, and I was in luck since they can be so hit or miss! The girl up front, Krystal was super sweet and welcoming.  I came in at 830 on a Sunday night, I was out within 40 minutes, at most. With medication, thanks to the in house pharmacy! Thanks for saving my time in Phoenix!!!!
5 This was our first visit here, however our daughter has been going here for some time and absolutely loves the PA and the staff.  What we found first off is that everyone there seems to be very friendly.  They greet you when you walk in the door and do their best to get everyone checked in as quickly as possible.  The difference between this office and other we have been to is that the staff is highly trained and committed to their work.  They know what to do and how to do it and they take pride in what they do.  The PA was listened to everything my wife said and gave some great suggestions on a course of care.  When she was done, she had the doctor come in who was very interesting and seemed to have a lot of knowledge on outside the box thinking which we really liked.  This is a place we will definitely enjoy having as a Primary Care and I highly recommend them.
1 Typical for profit medical clinic.  Always trying to sell you something.  Disorganised, and rushed.  Physicians are either senile, old men who cannot follow what your saying, or young divas who only see you as a paycheque. Constantly trying to sell you something else.  Wait is also MUCH longer than one would expect.  Even with an empty room and severe pain, it took three hours to be seen.
5 Blankenship has been the best office for me and in the last 3 years I have tried two therapists and three physicians who all told me they couldn't do anything except surgery. Tyler is certified in astym and boy does it hurt but is such a miraculous treatment on scar tissue. Their assistants are professional and fantastic hands. Top it off with licensed lymphedema therapist and I won't go anywhere else.
1 My wife attempted to stop in for urgent care at Piedmont Urgent Care-Baxter this evening and was turned away because they said "they couldn't help her type of pain there" and saying they didn't have the type of pain meds she needed. All I can say is I'm absolutely furious because they were implying essentially she was there for some kind of pain meds, which she hasn't had prescribed in years, maybe coming out of surgery years ago.   She ended up there by accident because in reality she was disoriented from what she was going through and trying to drive to CMC on Gold Hill Road.  They didn't even check her vitals, heart rate, blood pressure, nothing. Basically sent her on hey way, didn't bother to see what exactly might be going on. In reality she's had to deal with multiple health issues over the years which she was pretty up front with them about and was real clear she had no interest in pain meds, which she had to state after they accused her of coming in there for such.  Sad, sad day when patients with real medical need are pre-judged and turned away from basic care. This is not an urgent care facility and I do hope all my friends in Baxter village (we're in Indian Land) see this message and never go here. Spend the extra 5 minutes and drive down there road to Gold Hill CMC or find another Practioner. Appalled at the way the treated my wife and unfortunate I wasn't there to provide my feedback first hand.
2 The massage therapist was not that great, I told him where my problem areas were, and he never asked me through the entire massage how I was feeling.  I felt I was rushed in and rushed out, the massage ended exactly 1 hour, again never asked how I I was after.  The massage table was old and squeaked alot, the washer and dryer was beside my room and made lots of noise.  Worst massage experience I've had in a while, and I didn't have that relaxed feeling when I left.
1 Terrible staff Nurse practioner is RUDE! Would not recommend this practice to my worst enemy!
2 I love the weekend hours and that part is great. What was not great was the bill. I was charged $175 for surgery. I did not get surgery and it was a non woven piece of cloth that the nurse wet and then held it to my wrist. It was the size of 2 to 3 inches wide and about 8 inches long. She cut it to fit my palm to elbow and then started wrapping it with basic beige sports wrap. I had to help her wrap it. Then she said that I should keep my hand flat for about 20 minutes as the non woven fabric hardened. I was leaving and asked her how I was suppose to take a shower, she said to take it off. So it was a temporary splinter. When I got the bill, I called into the business office and complained about the $175 charge to wrap it ( they charged me $17 in addition for the splinter and wrap). I told the business office that it was not surgery and I had to help the nurse. I was told the charge was right. Now this was not the only charge, because there were xrays, doctor, etc. But $175 for the time (5 minutes max) to put on the fabric. Way too expensive and they would not reduce it. Be ware of their charges. Way too high Anne
1 This used to be the neighborhood urgent care when it was ran by that other company. Now, no way will I go back. I recently broke a couple ribs at the Metallica show (yes I'm too old for that). After a couple of days the pain was just too intense. My wife and I stopped in here, they are nice enough people and all. But they wouldn't do X-rays, well didn't do anything. Just said "we called in something for pain to your pharmacy." Well knowing you can't call in pain meds I knew this was going to be a joke. Sure enough, Naprosyn LOL. You can get that OTC. Have you ever broke or injured a rib? The pain can be insane at times....and this is what it's come to now. They refuse to treat patients. Literally have broken bones and you don't get treated. How bad is that? Do no harm. Sure. All patient care is gone. It's now care about the bottom line and don't get sued. Too bad you're in a lot of pain.
3 Saw an orthopaedic surgeon at this location today.  He was extremely knowledgeable and an excellent diagnostician, no doubt about it.  He listened to me when I described my ankle pain, explained the mechanics of the ankle, etc.  I would highly recommend this orthopaedic surgeon.  The only downside of this establishment are administrative details, i.e. initially being booked with a specialist who does not do ankles, then being booked by mistake on a statutory holiday ... I would give this place a five star if only things would run more smoothly administratively.
5 I bought a house in San Tan Valley in October and wanted to find a Dr nearby. I decided to give MyDrNow a try as I don't drive and thought I might need the in-home visit option at some point.   Front desk - I confused them by uploading my documents through the website and although the poor girl was new to the job both she and her trainer were gracious and got the whole thing figured out!  I tend to be ahead of the game technically it was totally ok they needed to figure out where the heck my documents went :D Everyone was very attentive and courteous. Instead of making me fill out paperwork again they dug down and figured out how to access the ones I'd uploaded :) I call that considerate and working with the customer.  I didn't wait too long to get taken back for vitals.   My FNP-C was Laura Babb and she was terrific! She listened to my concerns and made recommendations and I walked away feeling well taken care of.. Looking forward to checking in in three months! Her assistant was also considerate and friendly. I spent more time waiting for my prescriptions at Walgreens than I did in the Dr's office.   FNP-C's are Nurses with Masters degrees so it didn't bother me that it was a nurse vs a doctor.. I've been to Dr's who sped through our sessions and left me wondering what to do next.. or waving away any concerns I had.   My visit with MyDrNow was very positive and I look forward to getting healthier under their care.
1 DO NOT Recommend PHYSIOTERAPIST I only saw physiotherapist in the first session after that the assistant worked on my arm and worked on the wrong area. The exercise is done by different person who also is not the expert and it Is wasting time. They charge and invoice you for physiotherapist but the assistant and non-professional people do the work. YOU DO NOT GET THE SERVICE FOR THE MONEY THT YOU PAY. I will report to the association that why a non-licenced person does the work and they charge for the professional service and they write the name of the physiotherapist in the invoice.
5 Amazing staff and very friendly. Flexible with scheduling and the physical therapists are very knowledgeable and personable.
5 Dr Hajbandeh and his staff are very professional, always ready to accommodate with appointments. Doctor is very thorough and takes a lot of time to ensure that you are healthy.
4 I give 5 stars for Dr. Willden but only 3 stars for his  staff.  I have been seen by him for over 13 years and I trust him, literally with my life.  He is a good man and a great Dr!
5 I've heard some not so great reviews about the Core Institute, but I'm thankful that my experience has been nothing but positive. The staff that I've encountered have all been friendly, as well as my doctor, Dr. Patel. I broke my wrist and they have went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable and informed about all my questions.
1 I just became a patient here and have had two visits so far. The first time, Dr. Schlotterbock was 15 minutes late. The second time, I never even saw him-he was 45 minutes late and I had to leave. For anyone who is on a schedule, this is NOT the practice for you. Absolutely no respect for your time.
5 Got my Achilles' tendon fixed by Jackie (I made the mistake of jumping in the deep end with restarting my cardio). He's super attentive and an expert at what he does. Good job!
2 The care I have received so far for a major second degree burn has been fantastic. However, the wait time is ridiculous. I had an 11:30 appointment, arrived at 11 and didn't get called back until 1. I had to reschedule due to the fact that I would be late to work. If they had informed patients of the wait time, I wouldn't be so upset. I mean, I set an appointment for a reason. Seriously reconsidering my Urgent Care choice
5 Dr. Hogan is great and has greatly improved the symptoms of my Sciatica which is mostly an intense pain down my right leg. Dr. Hogan is always cautious when treating back and spine conditions and never attempts anything that could be risky to the spinal conditions of each patient. Dr. Hogan also is very good at explaining what he is doing to improve your condition, and the therapeutic techniques used to treat them.
1 Very strange conversation with the lady that answered the phone to schedule. From the start she seemed very much not to care about my call or scheduling my wife. The call was awkward throughout however what bugged me the most was when I asked if there were any female physicians and was told no, I responded with the fact that I should wait until my wife was available to ask her. I received an abrupt "ooooh" as if "do whatever you want to do, we don't really care anyhow".
5 Dr. Scharf is as good as it gets!  I cannot say enough nice things about Life Quest.    Dr. Scharf, and his staff, are friendly, knowledgeable, and have a very positive attitude.  It is like an extended family that eagerly accepted me, and is sometimes the only positive interaction that I experience in my day.  As a new patient beginning my treatments, Dr. Scharf took the time to explain every detail of what he would be doing, and made sure I fully understood, before moving on to the next step.  He made me feel very comfortable and put my mind at ease.  Dr. Scharf takes the time for proper care with all his patients.  He never makes anyone feel rushed, or lets them leave with unanswered questions.  His treatments are unique and brilliantly designed.  Most importantly, they work.  I tend to have tightness and a pinching pain in my lower back during extended physical activity, (especially when walking long distances).  This is something I have been experiencing since a car accident about 12 years ago.  After only a month into my treatments, I no longer have any back pain.  I walk 30-40 miles a week, and have a daily yoga routine, without experiencing any pain or tightness in my lower back.    The Staff:  As soon as you enter the office, Andria and Anna will greet you.  They are two of the sweetest receptionists I have ever encountered.  They are friendly, helpful, accommodating, and work very hard to make sure everything runs smoothly on the front end.  Philip and Annie help with much of my treatments and exercises.  They are knowledgeable, caring and a joy to work with.  A few weeks ago, I had my very first table massage with Chris who was amazing!  I will definitely be scheduling more of those.  =)  I have also seen the PA, Nicolas, for medical.  He is very friendly, professional and really listens to his patients.  His assistant, Rhia, is awesome as well.    I appreciate the fact that Dr. Scharf and Nicolas are not pill-pushers.  Instead, they work together to find physical and natural treatments for illness and pain, (reserving prescriptions for times when it is absolutely necessary).  I was excited to learn that massage therapy plays an important part in the healing and pain relieving process as well.    What I love about Life Quest is the integrated healthcare system that Dr. Scharf has set up.  Each moving part works together to take care of patients from head to toe; inside and out.  I am very thankful that I found Life Quest when I did.  I really believe in what Dr. Scharf is doing, and he has inspired me more than he knows.  #LoyalForLife
5 Being an older and retired couple (well not really "old") we arrived at Dr Dom's in need of adjustment of the infamous "Bad Back" and "Creaky Neck" syndromes of our ages. After a thorough examination and xrays, we were prescribed separate courses of treatment and an experience with the NASA-created "Magic, Mystery, Machine".  Capable of delivering specific impulses targeted to treatment areas this technological marvel was instrumental in charting our individual progress on a graphic screen, easily readable and understood by our laymen eyes. Dr. Dom recognized my further problem of scar tissue turning to cartilage in my shoulder from an old injury and turned me over to his talented protégé, Dr. Matt, who pressed, twisted and scrunched my arm over several sessions until any need for rotator cuff surgery vanished from my fear (and pocketbook) of a hospital procedure. We have been away from the PHX area for over a month (having moved to Nevada) but Dr. Dom's and Dr. Matt's continuing exercise regimens have succeeded in our continuing well-being and freedom from the aches and pains of our previous problems. Well done guys!  We will never forget the experiences... or the fun at the front desk with Candice, a truly top-notch lady.
1 I have gone to this urgent care center since I moved her 6 years ago and have always had a pleasant experience until this last time! I went into Urgent Care for a common cold. Was digoinosed and sent hoe with antibiotics and instructions! Was gone until I got a notice in the mail that I needed to fill out this paperwork for an injury of my hand! I called the number and explained to them I went in for a "COMMON COLD" and I sure as heck didn't have an X-ray of my hand! Was told to call the billing department which I did and told them the whole story and was asked are you sure you didn't have a x-ray done of your hand!  I am most certain I didn't have an X-ray as I would remember that. The lady said she would investigate and get back to me in 30 days! I have never heard back from anyone until today when I received a bill for 41.00 for a flu test and it was my final notice or they would turn me over to come collections. They didn't even bill my insurance and I paid it so it wouldn't go to collections. Found out through further research there are 2 claims that are pending for my insurance for the same date of service. So I would advise people to make sure they check their bills when they come in and check with your insurance company that it has been properly billed! If I could give it ZERO stars I would!  SURE WOULD BE NICE TO KNOW YOU ARE SUPPOSE TO PRIVATE MESSAGE THESE PEOPLE.
5 I've had weight problems since I was a freshmen in college. It's not as simple as just diet and exercise. I fell into a deep depression and started anti-depressants shortly after. It's hard to get out of the hole that seems to be getting deeper day by day but HCG program Cassandra informed me about changed everything. I not only have knowledge on food but I learned so much about myself, body and mind. I cannot thank the staff enough for this opportunity to learn and lose those lb's! Next week, I start my second round and I could not be more excited. 31 pounds lighter= a happier me.
3 I have been going here for several years to Dr. Whipple, he is a great thorough, friendly Doctor. The staff however is not as friendly, and waiting time is about an hour to an hour and a half. Trying to get the nurse to call you back is a joke too, so that's why I only give it 3 stars.
5 Eric and Tami have treated me on several occasions and I've never felt better! Since the birth of my 1 year old, I've noticed lower back pain and neck pain. Using their specialized dry needling treatment, PT methods, massage therapy and useful stretching tips, I'm finally feeling like myself and able to exercise without pain. I've introduced yoga into my weekly workouts, thanks to Tami's suggestion! I would recommend Impact Physical Therapy to anyone wanting to see results while gaining support from a group of people who really care about your recovery.
5 I absolutely love this place! My entire family comes to see Dr. Lillo. He has always been spot on with all of us, when something has been wrong with us. If you want an honest and thorough doctor, he's your man! We will continue to see him until he retires, but I hope that's not for a very long time.
5 Dr. Zacour was nothing but professional, kind and helpful during my visit yesterday. He truly cares about his patients, their comfort, and making sure they get the care they need.   The nurses I encountered were sweet and professional!   As for the front desk staff, they were courteous though they seemed very busy yesterday. Overall very happy with this office and will be a returning patient!
5 I do not typically write reviews because everyone in any service industry, including medical are human and can have good days/bad days. This time, I feel strongly others should know what I have experienced in recent months.  In my life, I have seen 3 other Chiropractor's with little results and they were all great, well intentioned highly recommended Doctors. None of their corrective measures made enough difference. One I saw for 10 years and I was able to maintain pain levels but not correct it! I have now been following a new plan of corrective therapy from Advanced Spine & Posture and I can say with 100% certainty... it really works! Real change to correct the spinal and neck problems I have had over 15 years. You have nothing to lose, put the effort in and results can happen. Call them! It is worth the call.
1 I went to Dr. Patel in May after I experienced a car accident in March and was still facing pain after 2 months of yoga.  When I first walked in the receptionist was cold and uninviting although she did seem very busy so I was willing to overlook this. When the nurse came back to do my intake, she did not speak English very well, which is GREAT for her speaking two languages but not great for me trying to explain what everything meant. When I got in to see the doctor his explanation was not that I needed physical therapy for sharp shooting pains, but that I needed to increase my vitamin D, continue doing yoga, and prescribed me muscle relaxants. In fact, he went on to continue to tell me that I was very overweight (I'm not), was going bald (I'm not) and was going to get diabetes if I didn't do something immediately like decrease my sweet intake (I really only eat fruit when my sweet tooth hits me). This was all unsolicited advice as I was just there to get a referral for physical therapy.  I finally convinced him to refer me after I called in again after my visit and it did help. Sometimes you REALLY should listen to your patients. I will not be returning.
5 Without a doubt Dr. Hogan is the best chiropractor in Vegas.  I love that he is always looking at other treatment methods that compliment chiropractic practice.  He's very straight-forward, LISTENS, is kind, and truly cares about his patient's health.  He looks at the whole package of your particular situation and gives it a thoughtful approach.  I find that going to him improves my health and makes me feel empowered: he will give me exercises and recommendation of therapies that I can do on my own to help my situation.  I definitely recommend him.
1 So i came in with my 7 year old son when I went to the back and they started to check to see if you have possible strep throat like a normal 7 year old he put up a fight the nurse precedes to tell him if you don't let us do it when the dr. Comes in and she will hold you down and get it done she's nothing nice the nurse proceeded to tell us how she seeing the doctor hold kids down any means possible to inject them couldnt believe this is what we were telling a 7 year old . Second nurse comes in and she's a lot nicer apologize for what happened. And then when we had the doctor come in I explained to her the situation and she acts like well I'm only here for today ask me would you like me to say something any human being would appreciate someone to say something to someone that works for them and it's telling kids this making them feel uncomfortable pretty much was trying to pass the buck off I'm only here for today don't know what you want me to do I told her what you guys aren't impressing me I'll tell you that her responses sorry I didn't impress you rolled her eyes and walked out Please be aware if you're bringing your child here they're going to manhandle your child probably because that's the attitude they have here horrible horrible Personnel here
5 I was referred to Dr. Brandon after injuring my upper back in a car accident, and I'm so thankful to have found him!  He has helped decrease my pain and improve my function and ability to tolerate my work activities in just a few weeks.  I'm still undergoing treatment with the goal of returning to my prior level of function including running, hiking, and working out at the gym.  Dr. Brandon and his staff are professional, knowledgeable, caring, and flexible, and I would highly recommend Kulp Family Chiropractic to anyone seeking freedom from pain and return to an active lifestyle.
5 I was referred by a friend since she was losing weight and looked amazing so I thought I should try it. I am so glad that I did and am now a monthly member. Julie is so sweet, she gives me water and puts on my favorite movie or show on her individual tvs. I would highly recommend her wrap to anyone. I have lost inches due Wellness Body wrap.
5 This massage is a magical experience.  It  is nuturing, healing, and intuitive. The space and atmosphere are beautiful- an oasis. Her technique is different and a synthesis of Luana's years of experience. She creates a sacred space with you for healing and balance. Enjoy !!
5 We moved my dad here for rehab after a horrible and torturous stay at Mi Casa. What a HUGE difference!  Total 360 with culture of the building and the staff!  The staff was caring and attentive, knew how to care for his catheter and actually answered the call lights within minutes. My dad saw the therapist a few times a day and he was so upbeat when we would visit him.  He had a gorgeous private room and we had some room as well to visit.  There was a couch in there and a small fridge so we could bring some snacks for him.  The staff was very kind and when he left, they helped set him up with a shower chair (also home health) at home and he was able to have his catheter removed!  The manager was also visible, asked us how our stay was going and if we were happy and if they could improve.  We had no complaints.  We saw her almost each time we visited which was quite often. Compared to the other facility where we were told anyone in charge "was in meetings".  Next time my dad goes to Banner Baywood, we now know we have a choice of where we want him to go and it will be Sante (if he ever needs to go to rehab again).  Very happy with this place.
5 Dr. Batra is a new family doctor accepting patients. She was very attentive and informative, listened to all my concerns patiently, and gave me a very thorough examination. She's also really nice and on time which I appreciate. I definitely recommend her for anyone looking for a new family doctor. She's also located very close to the subway so easy to get to. The building that the practice is located in also has other labs for blood tests or x-rays in case you're sent for one after.
5 I have been patient of Dr Mary Montes for about  6 Months now, everytime I Visit the office of DeRosa Medical at the Glendale, AZ office,  Doctor Mary and her Clinic Assistants Zahraa and Chelsea have always welcomed me and did everything to make my Visit as easy and smooth as possible, their Service is Outstanding, I highly recommend DeRosa Medical to anyone who is in need of an outstanding medical practice. I just want to Thank Doctor Mary and her Clinical Assistants Zahraa and Chelsea and the whole DeRosa Medical Staff for their amazing hard work to Reach every need of their Patients.
2 I had a family doctor here, Dr Mohabir, whom I saw for 2 or 3+ years (ETA wow I'm way off - it's been 7 years.  7 years!  Time flies!).  All of a sudden it turns out she's gone and this location is like...something else now?  I have no idea where my doctor went (or what happened to my information they had on file), and now they're only a chiropractic massage place or something.   If anyone has seen my doctor, holler at me!  Because I emailed them asking what happened to my doctor, and they certainly are not doing so.  (For real though, wouldn't it be nice if they informed their patients that they were leaving?  I find this odd and concerning and will be miffed about it for quite some time).  ETA (again):  apparently Dr Mohabir will be sending out a communication at some point, announcing her new location.
5 Given a massage as a gift. It was a good experience. Very good massage and positive interaction with staff.
5 I could not speak more highly of Jacky and his team!   I have been coming here for over a year now and I come back because of:   - The convenience of being able to book/cancel online - How knowledgeable Jacky is - Direct billing - Its cleanliness; also everything is super organized - Wide range of services   The location is also incredibly convenient-- just minutes away from the subway.  I'd highly recommend Step Up!
5 He is the best family doctor I have ever been to. Great with adults and even greater with children. I highly recommend Dr. Patel.
1 Dr forte had me go through cancer testing for no reason...Ruthless...  her pac didn't know why she had all the testing done.  she is one who should lose her medical license and no cancer. She ill be at negative stars soon
1 This place has the most disorganized and confusing patient intake procedure ever.   Our pediatrician referred our son here.  Someone called us from Fiesta and told me that they only have appointments 3-4 weeks in the future and asked if that was OK.  I said sure; then asked the clarifying question "You have no appointments available anytime between now and 3 weeks from now?" The caller asked me to hold on while she checked with the scheduler. She came back on the line and said she would transfer me to the scheduler, because sooner appointments were available. Scheduler said appointments were available as soon as the next day, and many the next week, and asked me for my preference. HUH? What happened to the 3-4 week thing?   I picked a time and the scheduler told me I had to arrive 30 minutes early to fill out paperwork. I asked if they could email me the paperwork instead, and they said sure. WHY would you make patients arrive early if you can just OFFER to share the paperwork in advance?  Then they talked about having to verify my insurance. They verified it, and then said that even though I had coverage, I would have to pay up front because they've "had problems with this insurance company" in the past.   The saga continued with other bizarre "policies" and plans. I cancelled our appointment and am going elsewhere.   Note to potential patients - ask LOTS of questions and make sure you know what you're getting into,
1 Brought my father and waited for over 1 hrs in the waiting room , then over 3 hrs in the back for the doctor to arrive. When complained office manger said that doctor is new and not familiar with the process.... The worst urgent room experience ever.  Not a place for people that value their time.
5 I didn't know if I slipped a disc, strained my back or pulled a muscle, all I knew is that it hurt badly and I couldn't walk, sit, or bend without severe pain throughout my back.  Mark diagnosed me in about 5 minutes.  He said I would be better in 24 hours.  I absolutely did not believe him.  I expected a six week recovery.  After he worked his magic, I felt much better not 100% but definitely 80%. He said that percentage would improve in the next several hours. By the next morning, I could walk, turn, twist, sit with little to no pain.  The next day I went back in to be sure I was completely better and I was.  ZERO PAIN!  In three days, I went from not moving at all to playing golf.  Mark is an incredible physical therapist.  I would recommend him to anyone. He has a great team of Physical Therapists.  I can easily recommend Mark, Joe or Shane!
1 Updating! So, the dispute was resolved at this office, but I truly believe, even after all this time, that this situation should never have progressed this far! I'm not sure I believe the integrity of this office is as great as they claim, as I feel I had been strung along and made to believe false information while trying to handle my claim (which I should have never gotten!). I have never, ever, EVER had a problem with my insurance, and I do believe this office was not fully truthful with me. I have since taken my business elsewhere to avoid the headache that this all was. ((Now, I know Healthy Outlook will reply to this comment, making my information seem less -serious- than it actually was, and I totally understand that. Keeping up with the customers, I get it. I just will never come back to this office again.))
2 Id love to give a positive live review but Im still sitting in the waiting room! The receptionist clearly doesn't like me and obviously entered everyone else in before me...   I cant say anything about Dr Trainor ... I still haven't met him... one star for being open and one star for a possible good doc..   Poor front desk skills...
5 I am new to Arizona so my family and I need to find a new doctor. I am so pleased to say the office woman was so patient, kind and joyful! I am looking forward to our appointments with the doctors.
5 I've been to my share of "Doc in the Boxes" in my life and this could have been THE best one I've ever been too! I had just the opposite experience as my Yelp buddy Kate.....they quoted me a time and I got in FASTER that what they promised! And got out even faster! Woo hoo!  The staff was very nice, and the facility is less than 5 years old and it is MUCH BIGGER inside that how it appears from the exterior.  I have never been offered anything to drink before at a medical clinic (yes WINE would have been my preferred choice but the water sufficed).......Still it helped my swollen scratchy throat.  This facility is clean and the lady Doctor was pleasant and efficient....which is exactly what I wanted and needed!  From my other fellow Yelpers, it appears that this place isn't consistent in its operations. But I can only rate it based upon my experience and, in COMPARISION to other Urgent Care facilities, this was a 5 star experience (IF that's even conceivable at a medical facility)!
5 I've been seeing Dr. McMahon, now Fontius, for quite a few years. She's always been kind, remembers me, and is friendly. She takes great care of my health. The two reasons I really love going here:  1. You never have to sit in the waiting room too long. I think it is totally unacceptable when DRs offices make you sit there for 30-40 minutes. That never happens here.  2. The receptionist is SO NICE. 90% of all healthcare receptionists are horrible with major attitude and this woman is very nice.
4 I love reading the review where someone pretty much says "I've been coming here for years and then one day I don't get my ass kissed and now Im going on Yelp to bash them and not consider the years of service that they have given to me or my family". I've actually been a patient for over a decade I can truly rely on this clinic for services for myself and my family. Yes sometimes its busy and you may have to wait longer than you'd like but that's life!!!! Go to Urgent/Emergent care or the ER and see how long you'd have to wait there or better yet what they will charge you.  Its clean, reliable!
1 This is the 4th time I have gone here....twice they were very nice and acted like they cared. The last two times have been HORRIBLE. The front desk staff have always been great though. The first bad experience was with a male doctor who we have heard from many times as being very rude...and boy was he. Making comments about my 1 year old son...he was VERY rude to me and his first words after I told him I had pain in my back was " Well what do you want me to do about it" seriously?! After being totally humiliated, I contemplated whether or not to return for a different reason today...well I returned and got a female ....almost same thing. She looked at my son with disgust because he was playing with his car and making noise...then she told me " I'm not an OB/GYN" Well no kidding lady...I came here with an issue to make sure it wasn't serious because I like to make sure-isn't that what you are there for?!?!?!?!?!
1 I've been happily going to this office for 20 years.  Unfortunately, they have lost their customer service skills.  If your insurance doesn't cover everything, they just charge your credit card!  Let's try an invoice with an explanation.  I don't know any other business that charges you without billing you first.  I've got no problem going somewhere else over this.
5 Thank you Dr. Reed for being so great !! Everyone makes me feel welcomed and comfortable.  They are so friendly and are always working with schedules, the wait isn't long and prices are great!  I wouldn't trust any other chiropractor!!
5 After reading all the reviews, I went in with very high expectations.  I must say, entering the place I was having second thoughts. It looked a bit dodgy,no reception area,just a small room with chairs that leads to the actual massage room on whose door there was a sign "Session in progress,please do not enter". Not sure if the pictures on here are from a previous location.  Regardless, my doubts quickly disappeared.The session began with health overview(all kinds of questions on general health,sleeping patterns,work,sports,etc) and posture evaluation.   The massage itself was very different from a typical massage you would get at a spa or somewhere else.A lot more involved if I must say.I was feeling a lot of pain during the massage. However, the moment I walked out I felt like I was flying. All my back pain disappeared.  Faz also gave me some tips and exercises I can do at home to improve my posture.  Overall, GREAT and I would definitely go back.
5 AZ Body Mechanics is awesome! The staff is friendly and Dr. Ehren always welcomes you with a smile and inquires how you are feeling. You can tell he truly cares. I've had 3 back surgeries and have utilized Pilates in my rehabilitation after those surgeries. Lesley Shea is the BEST instructor I've ever had. She pushes me hard to get a great work-out, all the while paying careful attention to my back condition. I haven't felt this good in a very long time! Thanks Lesley! You're the bomb!
5 I love the BackFit team!  I have been getting Chiropractic care all of my adult life and finding a place in Arizona where I can get adjusted, get therapy for strengthening, massage therapy, medical care all in one place has been a prayer answered.  The team is caring and they all work together to help you get stronger and healthier!
1 I understand that this office closed their doors  permanently and did not notify patients on how to obtain their medical records or transfer their medical care to another provider.  Can someone please provide me with information on how to obtain my medical records? Their office number has been disconnected with no forwarding information.
5 I went to see Dr. Mike a couple times a month for the last year and a half. I have neck/shoulder issues that cause migraines and was always very happy with the staff. I get way fewer migraines now than I did before I started going and am very sad I moved out of state and have to find a new chiropractor.  I like that they always do muscle work or the like on you before your adjustment. Everyone is super friendly, helpful, and attentive and I will miss them greatly.
5 I went to see Rosemarie after not being able to move my neck for 3 days. My shoulders were completely misaligned and crooked. She worked on me for an hour and a half. The treatment was so gentle, patient, and effective. I woke up this morning and took a picture! Wow! A huge difference in my posture! Our bodies are so important and must carry us through years of use, I'm so glad I found someone that can help me treat it right!
5 Amazing group!  If I could give them 10 stars I would.  I hurt my back and saw Dr. Christopher.  I can not say enough about how amazing she is.  Not only does she do amazing adjustments she CARES about causation and solving the problem!  I was beyond thrilled she took the time to talk to me in depth about the issue and what I need to do to correct it.  Today I saw Dr. Stone for Pain Management during treatment and he is also AMAZING!!!! He also took a great deal of time talking to me and working on my treatment plan.  I have physical therapy starting at this location tomorrow (so convenient you can see multiple providers under one roof) and I have no doubt I am in excellent hands and will be on the road to recovery soon!  If you need Chiropractic or Pain Management this is the only place you should look!
5 Grant Chiropractic is the best!  I had been having back issues for about 2 months before I finally broke down and decided it wasn't going to improve on its own.  So, I went to Grant Chiropractic to get checked out.  I knew about Grant Chiropractic from a previous visit for a promotion about 3 years ago, but I didn't start seeing them then because of my schedule.  That was a mistake.  After going to Dr. Grant's for about 1 week, my back pain was totally gone.  I actually had a spring in my step.  I'm sleeping better.  I've got more flexibility, and I don't creek and pop like I used to.  Life is great.  They get you in and out quickly because they have a lot of staff on hand, and their methods and equipment are modern.  They handled everything through my insurance, and I got a free T Shirt, too!  If you're having any issues with your body, GET THERE AS FAST AS YOU CAN!!!  Oh, and they have a sandwich tray on Fridays, which is nice -- Free lunch!
5 I can't believe there aren't any reviews on here for Dr. Chamian.   I've historically had a hard time finding doctors I like. They can treat you like you can't possibly know about your own health issues (not that I don't totally value a doctor's knowledge and experience, but I mean, hello, the internet is a bastion of information); they can get defensive or condescending if you try to self-advocate and actually contribute to your health care decisions, and they can be poor listeners who make diagnoses hastily so they can get to the next patient.  That said, I have been so impressed with the quality of medical care I've received in Henderson, and seeing Dr. Francesca was my first really positive experience here. She is an EXCELLENT listener. I have never felt rushed, I feel like she hears my every word and takes my feelings and opinions into consideration, and she is actively compassionate. She treats without ego, seeing the patient as a whole person who knows their own body better than anyone else. I feel like we have a partnership in the treatment of my ongoing health issues, and that is very important to me. It helps that she is knowledgeable about the issues I'm dealing with, and when needed, has referred me to a specialist when she felt like further consultation was necessary. I have always been treated with respect and affirmation at this clinic, and have always received excellent service- no long waits, no weird insurance issues, no having to make an appointment three months out.  FYI, the name of her clinic is Chamian Medical Group. I also saw her husband (Dr. Noel Chamian) at the same practice when I had one of this year's horrible viruses. I was also super impressed with him. He really worked with me to find the right medications based on previous experience, current meds, and what my insurance covered. I actually stopped in the middle of the exam to tell him how much I thought his and his wife's practice rocked!  Highly recommended!!
5 I have always utilized Yelp mainly for restaurants and nightlife but I am compelled to take the next step and write a review because of such a good experience I have had recently with Healthy Outlook. From the first instance of trying to book my appt on Zoc Doc to the conversations with the receptionists as well as the Nurses (prior to Dr. interactions) the experience was seamless. The office is very well staffed and the wait for the over 6 times I have visited the office in the last 2 years has been 5 minutes at most. That is unusual this day in age. The front desk greeter was so friendly and clear about next steps. When Zoc Doc was unable to book my appt, i received an immediate call from the doctor's office explaining why. (Over 40 now so a special time frame is needed that that Zoc Doc does not have programmed in.) I receive my very prompt appointment reminder call which is helpful and in one situation I needed to cancel at the last minute and was not charged a fee because I was an existing patient.  Both Dr.'s Cohen and Tymczyna are extremely knowledgeable and efficient. They do not rush the appt. but rather, they take the time to get to know the patient and take not just medical history but also family history very seriously. (social aspect-not medical.) The nurse has come in promptly to draw blood and within a couple minutes the Doctor knocked on the door and was ready to see me. VERY LITTLE WAIT.  These folks run a very efficient practice and most importantly, they are ALL client friendly and they value the clients they have. I might be one of the lucky few who has had the opportunity to see both Doctors in the past and will echo this sentiment for both.   Thank you Healthy Outlook for making my experience successful. It is never easy to go into the Doctor and your demeanor and rapport, not to mention professionalism, was second to none.
5 My visit here was probably the best experience I have ever had in a medical office.  Everyone was very kind and efficient.  I was greeted so kindly and I spent no time in the waiting room.  After the nurse took my vitals, she showed me to a room.  Shortly after, the doctor arrived.  She was very thorough and wanted to make sure she had my medical history correct.  I felt like I was in very good hands when I visited this clinic.  It was just the right amount of time to spend in a doctor's office.  If you are looking for a great medical center, you might want to check this one out.
5 My first Pilates experience was at Function Pilates. Vanessa was an amazing teacher and I really enjoyed my session. I am very active but Pilates was a great challenge. I highly recommend seeing Vanessa and her studio in Tempe!
5 Dr. Docasar is a fantastic doctor. I saw her years ago when her office was in Henderson and when my insurance wouldn't cover my IUD she went out of her way to make sure I got the care I needed in the correct way. After switching insurances and seeing other doctors and feeling mediocre about the care I was receiving I looked up Dr. Docasar to see if she was still practicing in Las Vegas. Thankfully she still is and I was grateful to switch back to her as my obgyn.   She is straight forward, genuinely listens to the issues you have and is always friendly. I couldn't be happier with her care.
5 I had been suffering with a sharp pinch feeling along my spine just below my neck when lying on my stomach & while propping my upper body up by resting on my forearms in a plank. I was referred to him by a fellow co-worker. Bring cash, $60 first visit and second and any others after are $40. The room is right by the front area and there is no music so privacy is nil . He needs to add some music or something so people waiting can't hear your conversations, but he is a genius and does amazing work. My wife has also gone to him for an adjustment. We are both very impressed. He is our go to guy for many issues! Highly recommended
5 After a gnarly mountain bike accident, which miraculously resulted in only muscle damage and no broken bones, my physician referred me for PT.  Andre was my therapist, and took all the necessary time to diagnose and successfully treat the injury to my rib cage area.  I was very pleased with the results.  Their techs were also terrific to work with and I would highly recommend Andre and his crew for any physical therapy needs.
5 Dr. D and his staff are the best! They have convenient hours, a primary care facility with available appointments AND chiropractic care! If you haven't seen a chiropractor because you are worried about cost, go see Dr. D and his team. They offer great value for their services!
5 Doctor John M. Milligan is a excellent ear, nose and throat (ENT) Doctor.    I highly recommend him.  The office staff and nurses were good.  He works out of two offices.  For more details, his bio is here. Arizona Otolaryngology Consultants  http://www.yelp.com/biz/john-m-milligan-md-scottsdale?utm_source=ishare
5 I was recently in a car accident and was referred to Dr. Day and his team for treatment. I can't compliment the Dr. And his team enough. Dr. Day is absolutely professional, takes his time in answering all your questions and his team is just as great. 5 stars all around! From scheduling, follow up, treatment and professionalism. It's a very personalized environment and you can see it as each patient comes and goes. They know everyone by name and genuinely care about the well being of their patients. I would definitely recommend the Dr. And his team to anyone. A+ all around
1 So upset that this place is not as good as we have hoped because it is so close to our place. New customers get a discount on first service. And their service was mediocre. The second time, my husband got a massage and was injured after so we emailed a manager twice and never heard from anyone. We are never going back because it wasn't worth it and obviously they hurt my husband's shoulder and didn't hear from them at all.
1 Do not go here, they are the worst, they said they took my insurance and then sent me a bill saying they did not take it , don't want to give them any stars but have to give them one.
5 The doctors here are great!  Linda from the front desk is so sweet and makes you feel part of the family! I was looking on Yelp for an integrative medical practice near Arcadia.  All the reviews were positive, and so I decided to take my health into my own hands and look for a more holistic and/or integrative approach from the standard conventional medicine.  Even though I moved to the other part of town, I still drive to the office regularly.     There's no doubt that integrating healthy habits into your daily lifestyle is costly.  Unfortunately, most insurance plans available through the marketplace and/or employers do not cover integrative/holistic medicine.    However, since finding Temple 29, I feel healthier and I have more energy.  It is worth every penny to make the change to an integrative medical practice!
5 So here is the deal... not every office or doctor is for everyone. You have to be willing to understand and office, its doctors and staff. I see reviews regarding insurances and the amount that True Harmony charges, guess what they have no control over that. As well as the time that they are able to see you. This is why they have a policy regarding late appointment or people who arrive late. They cannot control the amount of time the doctor needs to spend in a room with a patient who may have concerns. Yet, I also see those who feel like they are being rushed. When making appointments this goes for any doctor, you need to make the time to see them.   I know your thinking that I must work for the office, be friends or family. Well I am not. I have just personally seen the way that patients act when things are not going their way. It is a doctors office, they are not going to tell you everything that you may want to hear all the time. That is one thing that I like about this office. They are very upfront and honest. I have never felt as though I am taking test that does not go along with what I was telling the doctor is wrong.   My births were very difficult and I never felt as though Dr. Brass-Jones was pushy or did what she didn't feel was right. Actually she spent 3 days in the hospital with me checking on me all the time and giving my body the well deserved natural way with my son, who was my first birth. She knew my body was tired and that it was still trying. With my second birth she let me push until I couldn't any more and looked at me for me with so much compassion and appreciation, it will be a look I will never forget. At that time we both knew that it was time for a C-section as I was just getting my daughter more and more stuck. They worked quickly, she talked to me and told me it was okay to cry. She reassured me everything that I was feeling is normal and it is okay. Had I not had that, I probably would have had a full blown anxiety attack.   I have gone to her for 15 years. Here and there I have had office staff that may not been having the best day, but I never take it out on the office as a whole. Everyone has their opinions and this is mine and will continue to go to True Harmony because they have been great with me!
5 Dr. Boothe is by far the most effective Chiropractor I've been to ! I've had a frozen shoulder injury from weight training that he has corrected and his techniques to help my lower back bulged disc have been the most effective for relief ! Ive been to PTs and Chiros for years and none have shown me techniques like his ! If you have these issues I wouldn't go anywhere else
5 I spent many hours at Barrow Neurological Rehab and wanted to write a review today to anyone that may be dealing with health issues and wondering about rehabilitation.  Not only are the people at Neuro Rehab absolutely amazing, but they are kind and listen and help  you navigate your way through to whatever your new reality may be. My therapist, Dr. L.A. Campbell, made me stronger, calmed my fears, explained what was happening to me every step of the way.  I could not be any more grateful for her calm and logic - especially when I was freaking out which was fairly often. Do not hesitate to use these remarkable therapists to help get you back on track.  I honestly do not know what I would have done without Barrow Neurological Associates Rehabilitation Center.
5 Dr. Paster has been my doctor for around 30 years. He has always taken time to answer questions, give advice and follow up.
4 It's my first time with PT; luckily it's only one thumb on one hand. Having said that, I can only tell you what to expect in my experience here. The place seems a little ghetto/run down...has old equipment...even one of the therapy pieces I use looks handmade, but it works. Process goes: 1st visit, you may wait a minute while they prep your papers, so arrive 30min early to fill it out. Sign your name next to your printed name. Depending on how behind they are, you may be sitting a while, so score an early morning appt if possible. Evaluation-I had to squeeze 2 devices with each hand to measure "normal" and "the strength in the broken hand". They ask a bunch of questions regarding the before and after of the injury. After that I had two people alternating giving me different little apparatuses to work on with my thumb and an egg timer to do each one. At the end is the hardest part, where one of them holds your hand firmly and tries bending the stiff joint where it won't go...and nobody looks happy at this table while we're all doing these, but we're getting well together:) I got sent home with clear instructions for exercising and binding my hand at home. 2nd visit+: I sign in and walk straight back to my hand therapy table area. This time they set all the things in front of me and ask if I remember how, I do, and am outta there in an hour.  They definitely have it together and the staff that has worked on me/with me really cares.  I really don't mind going in, it's like the gym you HAVE to go to, if you want to move again.
5 I absolutely love this studio, the practice and the instructors.   I used to practice yoga regularly, but had neglected my practice for a while and had never tried any form of hot yoga.  But this past holiday season, on one of those days where you're running errands and you can feel the cranky stress of a lot of people you come across, I happened to drive by the BYT as it is right by my house.  A class had just let out and the most radiant, happy and healthy looking people emerged from the building- a stark contrast to what I had been encountering all day.  I thought to myself: I want what they're having! So I recently purchased a groupon to try it out and I am hooked already and am purchasing a membership to continue this goodness.  I feel incredibly energized, my skin feels amazing and I have shed several pounds already, but most of all my body and whole self just feels really good. I had heard from a number of friends that it is a super dogmatic practice with ridiculous antics and so on.  This has not been my experience at BYT, where the staff immediately remembered who I am, are so warm, friendly and encouraging and are always available for pointers if you need them.  Michelle who does the 9am class is fantastic and makes the practice not feel intimidating while still encouraging you to push yourself. I certainly recommend this place to anyone looking to boost their energy and feel better overall while in the company of people with really good energy.
5 I have seen my share of chiropractors, and Grant Chiropractic is by far the best!  Everyone is so nice, and genuinely interested in your healing and road to recovery.  It's not just a "crack my back and pay me" type of place, it is a whole body wellness office.  A majority of previous chiropractors were all about money, but not these guys.  They actually care about you which is so refreshing!  Stretching, decompression, stem, massage, adjustment, holistic assistance, and more.  I am so thankful that we found them! Bye bye headaches and neck pain!
5 I've never had a general physician, but I think it is a good idea to have one.  It was easy to make an appointment. The waiting room/examination rooms were clean and tidy. The staff was very friendly and professional.  My consultation with Dr. Bikas Sharma was thorough and listened to all of my concerns/questions.  I hope that I won't have to see Dr. Bikas often, but when I do need a physician, I will definitely rely on Trails Family
1 Very disappointing. She and her office staff are horrible and rude. They believe that its the patients responsibility to call the doctors office repeatedly to get results of blood work and other scans. What's even funnier is when you actually call they still don't get back to you and or know what's going on! She do anything to bill you insurance but will not call you to over negative results! She doesn't respect older people and think that she is better than the patients that are paying her. IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR HEALTH OR THE HEALTH OF YOUR LOVED ONES DO NOT GO TO THIS OFFICE.
5 The day before my wedding day, I was having a bit of anxiety.  I was nervous, not about being married or anything but about the day going well as there was a thunderstorm that looked like it would flood everything.   I yelped quickly and found Footscape, I was SO happy that I did... They took me in last minute, AMAZINGLY clean and professional.  I was so happy to come here I felt like a million bucks after and I'm pretty sure you guys are why my first dance went so well in 6" heels!  I will be back!!!
2 This review is for the office staff. Not necessary the doc I saw. Even though the doc I saw is not on their website. But my husband went in for his appointment and provided his Cigna insurance card at the time of registration. We get a bill today and shows absolutely no payment from my insurance , so I call and the billing lady tells me it's because they have Aetna. I asked how do you have Aetna when the insurance u was provided was Cigna. Her response was I don't know!!! That is not the answer I want to hear and if your going to make mistakes on own up to it. Then I tell her Sonoran lab also billed us and again no insurance payment. What She tells me is That I have to call them to update. Why should I have to call on an error you Did and get IDK answers? This has made me now have to look for a new doc for my family of 5. If she would have been more helpful or considerate I would not have felt the need to take my business elsewhere right away. But there were so many red flags and really PO about  How incompetent staff is. I will take back the 45 min drive back to my old doc
5 Physical Therapy One is a great a clinic with various services such as massage therapy,medical physicians that even allows walk in appointments,  and chiropractors just to name a few.  Each professional specialist brings in their own unique personal style which makes the visit more comfortable and fun. Nathalie, my physiotherapist has been extremely helpful to me by guiding me on how to strengthen my core muscles so that I don't injure them again from a recent accident. After a two visits, my lower back has been feeling a lot better than before so I'm happy that I don't have to walk around with a hunchback again.  I highly recommend to those that are suffering from pain and discomfort, you will not be disappointed.
5 My last visit to Desert Hand Therapy (DHT) - bittersweet! It all started in December of 2015 with Karin, all of my evaluation measurements were in the negative.  She made me feel at ease and assured me that I would win this.  I thought I'd never recover from this injury.   My mobility is now at 92%.  I certainly did not enjoy the recovery and pain.  However, the staff at DHT made my therapy enjoyable (never thought I'd use 'enjoyable' and 'therapy' in the same sentence).    Carlos-the ability to be myself and your humor got me through this.  You're awesome and I'll never forget your gentle approach - except when you were stretching me, not so gentle :) Thank you for pushing me!!!  Katy(sp?) - You're great, love your easy going personality and your ability to connect with patients.  You have a bright future ahead, just focus on the end result.    I've said this before and I'll say it a million times, if necessary - you're ALL amazing people providing extraordinary care!!!
1 Unfortunately I cannot recommend Dr. Wolfe.  My mother had a very bad experience here.  She had to be hospitalized for something that could have been prevented if Dr. Wolfe was offering a minimum standard of care.  During hospitalization Dr. Wolfe's office was informed that my mother was in hospital but they made no attempt to contact us, much less to oversee her care.  In addition they mixed up records that the hospital was urgently requesting.  After hospitalization we were told to follow-up with primary care within a few days but Dr. Wolfe's office refused to schedule a follow-up appointment for more than one week.  They were unhelpful and rude in a time of crisis.  I question Dr. Wolfe's competence and I think the office is poorly run.
5 Dr. Smith is amazing. I love him. He is the reason I keep coming back. Very thorough. Great job. Dr. Hererra very helpful. Staff drops the ball. A lot . But the doctors....they are worth whatever issues you have to go thru to get to see them.
4 I had surgery here. Everything was very clean, staff were very friendly & attentive. Extremely organized and the food was good! I definitely would recommend this hospital & would not hesitate to go back.
4 I was very impressed. I have been searching for a good massage since I arrived in the Phoenix area.  I have found such a place in Lifequest.  Shana, the masseuse, was VERY good and understood my muscular issues right away. She treated me properly and I feel much better today than I have in months.  Lifequest will be my new 'goto' establishment for massage and skeleton health.
3 I started going to MyDoctorNow in Mesa on Main St. about a year ago after a friend of mine referred me. Then my job changed and the one on Ellsworth was closer. So I started going there. The facility was clean, and for the most part private. The doctor did ok, but see, I was there to get my IUD removed and for whatever reason the doctor couldn't find it. So she sent me to get an ultrasound at one company(Simon Med(fuck them)) and they tried to make me pay my coinsurance up front $500.00. So I called the doctor's office and they sent me to EVDI, I literally sat there for 1 hour for them to bring me back into another waiting room for another 45 minutes for the tech to tell me that the doctor GAVE THEM THE WRONG ORDER!. They needed a vaginal ultrasound ordered, and my doctor gave them an abdominal ultrasound, and it would take FOREVER to get the doctor's office on the phone to get the correct one. I haven't called the doctor back to reschedule because I am afraid of what my reaction will be.
5 Attentive and courteous staff. I have never waited for longer than 15 minutes. Clean office and restroom and easy appointment scheduling.
4 The times I've been,  there has always been very little wait time.  I'm giving the low rating, because they tend to be tight on prescribing antibiotics.
5 If you've ever been frustrated with the typical physical therapy experience of repetitious exercises day in day out with limited progress, please give Eric and his team a try. This office does NOT subscribe to the cookie cutter PT experience! You are given a whole-body, functional assessment evaluation at your first session to determine what other factors and areas in your body may be contributing to the pain and dysfunction you are experiencing. They blend manual trigger point therapy, range of motion exercises, Graston technique, dry needling, and strengthening exercises to customize your treatment plan based on your symptoms and limitations at each session. You also work closely with the physical therapist, not just the assistant. They also give you practical homework and also resources for other therapies that can complement your care and speed up your progress.  I recently saw Eric to rehabilitate a shoulder impingement from a workout injury, as well as pelvic instability and nerve entrapment from the delivery of my daughter. He was able to rehabilitate both areas quickly so that I could start exercising again. He referred me to a great personal training studio where I was able to start strengthening my core and back as a part of my postpartum recovery as a part of my treatment plan.  I have known many people to choose Chandler Physical Therapy for their PT due to their customized treatment approach, and their genuine care and concern for their patients' care and progress. And they are just all around great people. Highly recommended without reservation!
5 Destroyed my shoulder really bad and went to 360 Therapy.  Spent a solid 8 weeks with Sarah Chapman and she really made the process fun.  All the staff were nice and always felt welcomed.  Definitely recommend!
1 This place was like waking up in a Stephen King novel. DIRTY,  uncaring lazy staff, holes in walls with wires hanging out. Someone elses blood on my call button.. no one responding in a timely manner when my roommate was choking on her own vomit. Left lying in bed for 3 days post knee replacement surgery.  I allegedly have good insurance, PPO.  GOD HELP US ALL
4 My entire family is seen at this practice, including my 4 and 5 year old.  The wait time for your appointment is a crap shoot and sometimes takes forever.  I attribute this to the fact that the practitioners never, ever appear rushed and are always willing to answer every single ridiculous question I have.  They are thorough and knowledgeable.  The urgent care next door is nice if you can't get an appointment (although hours are still limited) -- they share record with the doctor, making it easy to get follow up care.
5 I've been with Brighton Family Medicine for over a year now and I'm glad that I'll be able to continue as a patient here with my new insurance.   The location is convenient to my home. PLENTY of parking (unlike the parking lot of the physician I was seeing in the St. Rose office building). The office is bright and clean and the office staff are very professional. They do a great job and go the extra mile with referrals or just locating a good health care professional in my network.   Dr. Kim is easy to talk to (especially coming from a PCP who brushed off any of my concerns, even when I knew, as a healthcare professional myself, that more intervention was necessary). Dr. Kim took the time to listen to me and included me in my own care plan, which I very much appreciated.   If you're looking for a PCP, I don't think you can go wrong with Brighton Family Medicine.
5 I only worry that rating the highly will result in them having more patient and me having to wait longer for an appointment.  I have been using this office as my primary care physician for 15 years with fantastic results.  And contrary to public opinion the office does have computerized records.
5 Dr. Henderson is a one of a kind.  One may hear the title Chiropractor and all sorts of images and beliefs flood the mind.  As an orthopedic practitioner myself, I am included in those who do not trust the profession.  However, I had the privilege to have my impression changed for the positive.  However, I don't think there are any practitioners like Dr. Henderson.  He is more than a chiropractor.  He is skilled in assessment of more than just the musculoskeletal system.  He is trained in several areas related to treating the muscles and joints lending him able to pull together the 'story' that facilitated a person getting to the point of needing intervention. Dr. Henderson can in few sessions remediate complex issues where traditional medical intervention fails us.  My first time to see him he spent two and a half hours with me, the second time two hours.  My problem of 3 years duration and several attempts with physical therapy was fixed by Dr. Henderson and has not returned.  Per his instruction, I continue to do exercises and stretches and will gladly return if I ever need to. Now, it may be necessary for some people to return more than twice.  But Dr. Henderson does not practice like most chiropractors in that he doesn't just do a couple little things and send you on your way.  He fully assesses you each time, listens to what you are dealing with and then does whatever is necessary to remediate the  problems how ever long that takes.  I can say without reservation he is wonderful and gentle and competent.  He truly cares about you.
1 Don't go here. Although we loved Dr. Shields, the office policies (greed) are ridiculous. They will make you come in to see the doctor for everything! My husband and I should have a tent outside the building as much as we go here. They will not refill prescriptions or simply call in a simple medicine without an appointment. I am looking for a new place to go ASAP!
2 Extremely incompetent staff. It took me a MONTH to get a prescription refilled because they either ignored the refill request from the pharmacy or sent it to the wrong pharmacy. This happened even after I went into the office. I am now sitting in a radiology facility waiting for a mammogram because CareMore said they would FAX them a referral 3 weeks ago and of course, did not. Also, I have never waited less than 30 minutes in CareMore's waiting room.  They always overbook.
5 I first met Casey through yoga classes and found her gentle, grounded approach very appealing. Because I have a few "body issues" (a compressed lumbar disk, some osteoarthritis in my neck and mild osteopenia), I needed to work with someone who would be respectful of my issues and yet still offer a challenge to keep me limber. After months of yoga classes, I decided to try out Casey's massage skills.  As others have mentioned, the AZ Therapuetic Associates' facility is a gem! I love going there because it is warm and comforting, clean and calming. It is like a little oasis of health and wellness!  Regarding massage, I have had other massages and I can unequivocally say that Casey is the best! I trust her advice on how to stay healthy and I recommend her without reservation. I would also trust her recommedation to try her other associates.
4 I have been more than 8 times and I have my family doctor there (Dr Growal). The doctor is really awesome, she is taking time to listen to me and trying to find solutions every time! It is really appreciated to have a doctor like that. The cloud clinic has extended hours which is great. I am little bit sceptical though with the people doing blood test I went there last saturday for a blood test, 2 persons couldn't find my blood after trying with 6 needles!!...They kept trying to find a vein moving around the needle inside my arm which caused a lot of pain...The receptionists are furthermore not really nice when I call them to make an appointment, it seems they dont like their work.
5 I can't say enough good things about Wellness Body Wraps Health Studio. Would give it 6 stars if I could. Julie, the owner, is very passionate about her business and extremely knowledgeable which obviously shows in the final product.  A welcoming experience from walking in the door until walking out unbelievably relaxed. This was my first body wrap and I will definitely be back.
5 I have been a patient of Dr. Sullivan for just over 10 years.  He is extremely thorough and attentive to your needs.  He takes the time to get to know you and listen to what your needs are.  He works extremely hard to make sure you are well taken care of.  He is not afraid to make referrals to specialists if he feels he is not the best to handle your symptoms.  I have always been able to get same day appointments when extremely sick.  When I lost my insurance for 90 days due to a job change he and his staff were very helpful in making sure that I had refills and samples of all the medications that I needed and mad sure that I knew they would help me should I become ill during that time frame.  Sure enough, I came down with a sinus infection and they helped keep my out of pocket costs low.  When I moved to AZ I picked his name out of a book provided by my insurance company and he has been one of the best picks I've made in my life.  Anyone who has accompanied me to an appointment has been impressed with his practice and him as a person.  His wife works in the office from time to time and is extremely pleasant and friendly and his staff remembers me by name anytime I call.  His office is small but clean and well maintained.
5 Best chiropractic office, ever!!!! I had some severe back pain and Dr. Hortin worked his chiropractic magic. Feel so much better. Plus Dr. Hortin is really cute. It's nice to have some eye candy during your adjustment.
1 worst place ever, I chose it for my PCP for availability during the week and weekend hours but its horrible. Every time I go in I'm waiting for hours, last time I had an appointment and only needed a referral and still waited almost 3 hours.... And 3 weeks later I am still waiting on the referral and have had to reschedule my appointment at the office I need to go to due to not having the referral. The office is just chaotic and the Drs. are very slow its not a big place there's no reason to have such long waits
4 Nice little practice with friendly staff.  Their new office is very nice.  The waiting room has a calming effect because of all the tile and plants.  They don't do their own blood work but there but there is a Sonoran Quest lab in the same office complex.
5 I tossed my back out when a wave tossed me!  My doc recommended Foothills Sports Medicine and so did a friend for my back issue.  Christy massaged my back and applied the needling technique.  Every staff member was friendly and caring.  I felt pampered and actually enjoyed going to therapy.  It took 3 weeks but I'm bionic now and good as new!
1 Horrible patient care and only concerned about the $$$ at this office. My husband has been on maintenance medication for over 10 years and this doc won't provide a refill for longer than 30 days. My husband travels frequently for work and has asked numerous times to get a longer refill to avoid running out of meds during his travels. The doc just ignores him and requests yet another office visit (where a copay is due) for refills. We changed doctors about 4 months ago and the new doctor and us have requested our medical records numerous times and still have not received them.  Horrible horrible patient care!!!
1 Talk about rude! I called to make a yearly physical appointment for my day off. I was told that my doctor was out that day. I asked to see another doctor and was told I couldn't. Then I was told that if I changed doctors it would be a male and that I wouldn't be able to change I back. I hung up.   I should also mention that my husband went to the ER and needed to follow up with his doctor at this same office. He called twice to make an appointment and never received a return call.   They clearly don't care.
5 I've been suffering from severe back pain and after a few visits to Dr. Matt, I can now sit at my desk 9-5 and work out without a complaint. Dr. Matt patiently explained my condition, gave me useful exercises and has never failed to make each visit enjoyable.
5 Was visiting Canada from the United States and had an acute injury and spasm to my back and neck. Received multiple massage therapy treatments from Derek and was able to sustain my trip for the entire month due to his help. Great service, easy location, very therapeutic massage therapy. Was in alot of pain and Derek was very attentive to keep me comfortable throughout my sessions.
4 Only waited about 15 min. for the Dr. She is from New York, new to the area. We will give her a try.   I did get the opportunity to speak with Sara the manager. I found her in her office located next to the Check out area. She said she had not received any of my messages because they were experiencing problems due to construction. She did say it was the Administration, Larry Preston, decision not to inform patients when Doctors leave the practice. And that sending a mailer with their new address would have been too costly.  I feel so special!
1 I have been coming here for over a decade. It was my goto place when I didn't feel well. Hurt my back or rolled a quad. During time with my quads I was in so much I should have had a speed pass.   Today was my last visit. I was the first customer of the day.  The young man up front was nice and got me from the parking lot with a wheel chair. As I couldn't walk from the tremendously hurting ankle. He was 5 star nice.   The X-ray tech Marie was nice and careful with the wheel chair. Took her time taking me for x-rays and made sure to back into rooms to avoid hitting my foot. Thx Marie.  She also took care to deliver me back to my vehicle.   Now the reason for the score. Dr Tracey.  I have broken nearly every bone in my body over the years and this ankle hurt as bad as any of those.  I couldn't stop my eyes from tearing up from the pain.  Dr Tracey said she had a prescription that would ease the pain and eliminate swelling (even though I had no swelling) and another that would help with sleep because the pain was so bad I couldn't sleep.   I trusted her to give me something that would work but was concerned because in all the years I had been coming there no one had ever prescribed this before.  Two and a half hours later I get the prescriptions filled and take them.   I laid down with ice and 5 hours later still in crazy pain. I look up the pill and it just an anti inflammatory medicine. Not for pain. I called back to the urgent care to ask if we could get something that would work prescribed because this isn't right or working.   Dr Tracey refused. She said that's what you get. She would not reconsider. So now 7 hours later I'm left to go to the emergency room and see some one that will lesson to the patient and care if a medicine is working.   I later shared my experience with my wife and we discovered her reasons for not returning were the same as mine. Dr Tracey.   Save your money. It's not worth the visit to Dr Tracey.   Good bye Warner urgent care.
1 Oh my...where do I begin!  I had an excellent doctor who left the practice around 2010 or so and from that point on my experience was horrible.  I was billed for an invalid fee, I showed up for an appointment and had fill out new patient information again (b/c they were updating their system) and at that point I decided to go elsewhere.  Now after several years I decide to start back b/c the location is extremely convenient.  I called last week and spent 45 minutes getting all of the medical information updated for myself and my kids.  After spending more than half of my lunch doing this, I asked if all the information would be saved in the system so I could just call back later and schedule the appointments.  I was told yes. I called back 3 days later and proceeded to set up my son's appointment for a sports physical and immunization - half way thru she put me on am 8 minute hold and when she came back she explained that the Ahwatukee office did not offer vaccinations and I would have to schedule in Gilbert for that service.  Disappointed, I proceeded to scheduled his physical.  After that was done I moved on to schedule my oldest son but she could not find him in the system.  I explained my frustration and asked her to double check b/c perhaps they had the DOB incorrect in the system (there is no way to justify finding one but not the other)  Marissa unapologetically  proceeded to gathering the same information I had just provided days before....at this point I realized they hadn't changed, I told her to cancel the appointment we had just scheduled and forget about it b/c I would just find another provider and she said, "oh really, after I've done all this."  At that point I was done!
5 Okay, I'm admittedly biased since I'm one of the PTs here. But I absolutely love the clinic, my coworkers, the company, and the patients. It's always a fun environment and all of the PTs, myself included, try to give patients the best care possible.   The reasons that l chose to work here are the same reasons I believe it is the best PT clinic in the area: We are more concerned with quality of care instead of quantity. At the end of the day, it does not matter how many patients were seen or what revenue was brought in. What truly matters to the staff and the company is that the patients are getting better and are happy with the care they receive.  Tip: OSR offers Free Pain Assessments for new patients. It's a one time no-commitment appointment where a PT does a brief evaluation of your injury, performs a short treatment session, explains the injury and treatment options, and makes recommendations. This could be that the injury isn't serious and just needs an exercise program (which would be developed and given to you), that it could benefit from a few or more PT sessions, or that it warrants further evaluation and imaging by a physician (in which case, you'd be given referral options). So if you have an injury that's bothering you, and you're not sure if it's something that will work out on it's own or need treatment, just come in and find out!  Tip #2: Just in case you aren't aware, AZ is a direct access state. That means you can come see a physical therapist without a referral :)
5 When I first met Michael Hofstatter, I was in a great deal of pain.  I had been to 5 physiotherapists before finding Michael, and none of them were able to diagnose or treat the cause of my pain.  After an in depth assessment, Michael was able to diagnose my problem and begin treatment.  My condition has improved so dramatically.  When I started, I didn't think I'd ever be able to walk without a very pronounced limp. Now, I'm back to training for marathons and doing long distance bike rides.  Michael is the most caring, compassionate medical professional that I have met.
5 Dr. Hirst and his team are the most friendly and professional Chiropractic offices I have ever visited.  I've been a patient there for a couple years and always look forward to my next visit.  Everyone I have referred has enjoyed the same experience.  They are very good about focusing on your problem areas, getting you healthy, and then keeping you that way!
1 Scheduling doesn't know what they're doing they cancel your permanent spots and give them to somebody else. They inconvenience you by charging you when you're late and don't let you go to your appointment but when they mess up your schedule and make you drive across town for nothing nothing is done what a huge inconvenience really considering taking my son out of this place!!
5 LOVE this practice!  I have to admit, given the area, I was a bit weary. However, from the ladies at the front desk upon check in, to the nurse, to Dr. Norton, everyone was very customer service oriented, personable and professional. From check in time to being seen, was a total of 15 minutes and I appreciate that I was thoroughly explained to, the process of logging in to the patient websites to view medical records. Also, in being seen, I was not rushed or made to think my questions were irrelevant. Overall, I was very thankful that I gave this practice a try and will continue to go back!
1 I had intentions of joining the new LVAC off of 215 and Decatur. However a coworker who lives in Henderson seemed to love EOS so I signed up at this location which is closest to my home. Unfortunately I also convinced my mom to sign up as well.   While the actual gym is great, the staff friendly, the classes are wonderful...DO NOT SIGN UP FOR THE PERSONAL TRAINING!!!  What they don't tell you when you are signing what you think are basic gym membership papers is that you are obligated to pay for this service for 6 months. So while the membership is month to month, you cannot cancel the personal training. The two people that we spoke to upon signing up for this service a month ago neglected to state that little fact. Now my mom, who wants to cancel,  is obligated to pay $128 for the next 5 months!! I do understand the nature of a contract, however how about showing some ethical business practices. You must truthfully  inform people of what they are signing up for. But the young man seemed more intent on gaining his commission!! This is the same young man who was also supposed to change my method of payment, but just yesterday my dues were taken from my debit card instead of the credit card I gave him that he assured me he switched it to. On top of that, in disputing this charge, we both realized we never even received the contracts we signed for the PT service. And don't bother calling their membership services, they are absolutely no help whatsoever. The  CSR was rude and only interested in getting me off of the phone.  After leaving a message with the membership services supervisor, Mondji, she calls me back TEN DAYS LATER to tell me there isn't anything they can do. As much as I love this gym, I'm very seriously considering cancelling  both memberships and going with my original plan of joining LVAC.
1 I am not going back there. After getting a second consultation, I found out that they made a completely wrong diagnosis and they wanted to drug me with too many useless over-the-counter medicaments. The place is also very squeezy.
1 This was my second and LAST visit to Dr. Lopez-Benitez for an annual Pap smear. I wanted to discuss Peri-menopause with him and asked several times to have my hormone levels tested, he refused, dismissing me by saying "Why even check it, it won't change my mind about anything". He was not interested in my concerns in the slightest. When I did push him to answer my questions, he rolled his eyes. Ladies we have more choices out there and I personally think that given a choice, we should choose someone that takes the time to answer our questions, especially when it comes to reproduction. It felt like going back into a 1950's Dr. office. His staff was also rude, short and unconcerned. They were too busy with their personal phone calls to take care of patients.
5 best massage in scottsdale best deal in town great great great new summer special $25 cannot beat that!!! thankx massage haven you are heavenly!
4 A little different than what I'm used to but, I love Gina's class.
5 I was injured in a pretty bad car accident in July of 2015, I was sent to Rapid Rehab right away and I was very scared of being treated as a number at another Physical Therapy facility, but I was very wrong. As soon as I checked in Aaron and Cassidy greeted me with so much respect and amazing customer service just like I treat patients when they check in at my work, I knew I was in the right place! I was relieved to have found such a caring place that actually cared about my wellbeing and fast recovery. Connie and Jess were my assistants from day one and I was extremely blessed to have come across such amazing individuals for such a passion and dedication to the wellbeing of their patients. Heather Darby was my Physical therapist she explained step by step the process of the therapy and accommodated to my busy schedule from the moment I started, I am a single Mom and I was worried and scared and the whole staff was so helpful and amazing that I left my last of treatment not only feeling great but also sad because they became part of my family, I am blessed to have been sent to Rapid Rehab and I look forward to refer them to anyone that comes to ask me how I did it. Thank you Heather, Connie, Jess, Aaron and Cassidy you truly are amazing and I hope you continue to make patients happy and make them feel welcome and continue to provide such an excellent job on the road of recovery! Truly blessed...  Maria Celeste Perez
5 I see a few bad reviews on here but I have nothing but great things to say about this Urgent Care. This was the cleanest and most friendly UC I have ever been to. The staff was quick to get me in and went above and beyond in my opinion to make sure that I was satisfied with the care. The nurse I had was super sweet and made sure to write down all of my concerns. Checking in was a breeze when I printed my paperwork at home and walked in and handed them everything. I was waiting maybe 5 minutes before I was called back. I will be coming back here if I ever have to again.
1 This office is ineffective at managing the customers time. I've been here an hour in the waiting room and the lady before me has been here 2 hours!  Apparently the doctor has a dental emergency and they asked everyone to come in early, which we did. I guess they just want us to sit and wait like our time is not valuable.  This will be my last time sitting in this office.
1 The doctors spend barely any time with you after making you wait forever then rush you out without hearing you out. The staff is incredibly abrasive, and unhelpful.
1 Not a good experience. Very rude front office staff!! The lady seems to hate her job and has no patience.
5 Dr Legg and Dr Wolf are professional and efficient . Thank you for helping me become pain free.
5 I have been coming to this office for at least 12 years maybe longer.  It is always very busy. It is a huge office with a lot of people working here.  Even more patients.They seriously must see hundreds of people a day here. it is located in inner city Phoenix, but since I lived in inner city Phoenix for 20 years,I think it is most convenient. Even though I have now moved to another town. I still come to this office. One of the best things about this office is they will fit you in for an appt. within 2 days. I cannot say that about anywhere else,most Doctors office have you waiting for 1 month,I have been trying to get in to a specialist that I have an appt,7weeks after I called. They really do try to get you in as quick as possible. I have friends that will have a family DR. ,become really sick and have to wait 2 weeks before they will see. Yes, you could be dead by then. This place gets you in ASAP, never more than 2 days. I love my Dr. she is friendly , efficient , and is always willing to answer questions without rushing out. Her MA is fantastic as well. They remember you when you come in and go over your chart with you each and every time. The Blood lab is right there on the property.  Which makes it great that you do not have to drive anywhere else. Good medical care, fast appt., every thing you could need. ample parking, very convenient.
1 Be prepared to WAIT! I've been here 3 times now & left the 2nd time w/o seeing the doctor. After check in you typically wait 10 mins before being called into 'the room'. It's a busy office but it's ridiculous to have to sit and wait and wait and wait in that tiny claustrophobic room for anywhere from 45-60 mins waiting to see your doctor.  They book too many patients to be able to handle the load in a reasonable time frame. If I had other options right now I'd go elsewhere. No one there really seems to care about the inconvenience to the PAYING patients and show lack of respect for OUR time! NO wonder they have so many TV screens everywhere - bring something to keep busy with!!!!!
5 The people at Matt Smith are GREAT! I couldn't possibly acknowledge all that they have done for me or compliment them enough on their great attitudes their friendly nature and ultimately their caring approach to helping you get back to a "normal" life with usual activities. Their facility is clean and well kept, and so is the equipment. The therapists are knowledgable and consistent in their treatment.
2 Dr. Robertson is an awesome Dr. however, the staff is very unfriendly and wait time is incredibly long. Expect to be at an appointment for minimum 2 1/2 hours.
4 I am really surprised at some of the other reviews...actually shocked! This is the facility at 101 and Pima in North Scottsdale. Everything about it is first class including the food. I had a hip replacement and went from the hospital directly to Sante. Almost every assistant and use was helpful and quick to respond. I got all my meds on time....and all meals are top notch. As I understand it, state law, and usual practice, have Drs rarely being on site.I wish th w was changed but my experience was really good. AND, they made all the arrangements for PT at home and a social worker , who found me some money to help pay my caretaker.
2 I am extremely happy with Dr. Adams, she is a very good Doctor.  I've been coming here for about three years.  The wait times are ridiculous.  Today, I had an appt. at 9:30 and am still sitting here waiting. They no longer take walk in's which I thought would help and it hasn't changed a thing. Even though I am happy with the Doctor, I can't justify the wait times. I will be looking for a new Doctor
4 This doctors office is very clean and close to my home. Doctor smith is amazing and great with people. Amy in the front office is so sweet and is totally their for you. I would have given this place 5 stars but the lady up front is not very friendly. She seemed to get very upset at the smallest things. She seemed to just be there to get a pay check. Just my 2 cents
5 Illumina Health is really a great place to be.  Angelo and team do a phenomenal job in both treating you, and educating you about the benefits of all their forms of treatment.  From cryotherapy, to leg compression therapy, and the photon genius sauna, I am able to complement my existing wellness routine with state of the art recovery treatments.  Along with being knowledgeable and attentive, the team is engaged, caring, and always super friendly - such a great environment!  Highly recommended!
5 My daughter has been seeing Jenna for PT, and we have seen improvements in just a few weeks. She pushes just hard enough and is still kind and understanding. I have been here for my own back problems also. They are great with kids and adults in my experience. The front staff is welcoming and very good as well.
5 Amazing massage. Deep tissue like I've never had before. Jim really worked on me and worked on getting the stiffness of my muscles and I'm going to feel it tomorrow. One of the best messages I've ever had!!!!
5 Dr. Nicole and the entire staff of Chandler Family Chiropractic as well as Dr. Carson with Robertson Family Chiropractic are phenomenal! They are very attentive, caring and understanding of your needs with EVERY treatment and service they provide. Massage therapy also is highly recommended! With everything from manipulation, physical therapy, exercise and consults you always feel SPECIAL!
5 Dr Donesky.. Best Dr. EVER! Too bad my insurance company can't get their act together.  Thank you Tricare Prime. The doctor you approved, isn't even a doctor. The ratings are horrible. Hatfield Medical Group, is a joke. My husband and I, want our doctor back! My nasty letter writing campaign, begins now. Dr Donesky has been my doctor for over 12 years. We WANT HIM BACK!
2 Going to be brutally honest. Came here for eyelash extensions and the results were not too great. The aesthetician who did them was very nice unlike the front counter.. However the results were my lashes looking sparse, uneven and not worth the money. Pretty unfortunate as I saw great reviews and expected more. I was told 50 strands per eye but it's seemed more like 50 in total. Would not recommend.
5 Still consistently awesome staff and great care. I have to add now that their massage therapists are absolutely stellar! I've treated myself a couple of times, and these people rock!  I can't recommend this place enough!
5 Nice office. staff is friendly upfront, but the doctor could be a little more sociable and personal.
4 I know the medical director of urgent care extra and I must say he would expect better from this staff. Care was fine but the wait time was insanely long. I expect urgent cares to be quick and efficient. I came in with left foot pain and waited in the waiting room for about 45 minutes. Then I got in my room where my blood pressure and pulse was taken. She asked me a few questions then off to get an x ray which I believe most urgent cares are striving to have. Anyways, 3 x rays later and I'm back in my room...waiting. it's been another hour and no PA/NP. I also found out they only have 5 rooms so once I'm back here I find it hard to believe the provider hasn't gotten to me yet. It's taking forever!!! I give it three star for the x ray, in-house pharmacy, and clean facility. -1 star for SLOW-MOVING staff. By the way, the check-in offer does work so that's another star. I got my prescription for free because it was my first time here.
5 We love "Dr. Popcorn", as my son calls him.  Dr. Mike has made a huge difference in the life of our 5 year old. (We have been seeing Dr. Mike for about 1.5 years.)  We trust him explicitly and we have received great advice from him and his staff.  We have had an almost a complete reduction in recurring ear issues, leg and hip pain, and gait issues for my son.   We are very happy with our service and would recommend him to any of our friends and family.  He is amazing with small children - takes the time to explain everything and even adjusts a teddy bear to put the child at ease.  I can't say enough about Dr. Mike and Martha.  They are fantastic people with a high level of integrity.
1 Worst urgent care ever! Don't waste your money or time.! You'll wait forever and they do unnecessary test and still won't know what's wrong with you.
1 I moved in Henderson and looking for a new doctor, but nobody answers every time I call to make an appointment. Called 4 times in 2 weeks, last call was yesterday and someone answers but can't even get me an appointment.
5 If you want a nice fluffy massage where you'll be smothered with fancy lotions & aromatherapy this is NOT the place to go. But if you are active and hard on your body and once in awhile you need a darn good painful deep tissue massage to get that soreness away, this is the place to go!! I went for the first time and had Sonia who was great! They are conveniently located in downtown Danville in a tiny little office ... Nothing fancy but adequately peaceful enough. They charge $95/hour and only take cash or check, but well worth it; will go back for sure!
5 Melanie at Myocare has great hands.  I've been getting massages from her for 4 years.  Her location in the Annex works great for me and I can't say enough good things about her. She uses various techniques and pressure that really allow my body to heal.  I now go as a preventative measure to make sure problems don't develop. Thanks so much Melanie!
5 Dr. Swenson's office is always a pleasure to visit.  The location is conveniently located, the office is new, and the staff is very polite and always seems to remember my name!  I'm an optometrist, so I know how hard it is to always be at your best and this office seems to do just that!  Dr. Brett Swenson is a very knowledgeable doctor and always explains things well.  Keep up the good work.
5 Went to MVP to get my back worked on after I tweaked it at Crossfit. Michael was able assess exactly what happened and was able to not only educate me on what was going on, but was efficient in the hour I spent there and I felt brand new by the time I left. Would recommend to anyone with nagging injuries or even for ongoing maintenance. 5  stars, "MVP" level treatment!
5 The only regret you'll have is not calling, Dr. Steve made me pain free!!  I recall an early Saturday morning 3 or 4 years ago, waking up and feel a bit down maybe a bit of a cold. A sudden and unexpected sneeze came about and in the moment of release, a severe pain in my neck replaced the usual feeling of relief that follows a sneeze like that. It was agonizing and I really had no idea what to do. My head was literally stuck in a sideways position because moving it straight or to the opposite side felt like someone was taking a pair of pliers to my nerves.  After an hour or two of "Waiting it out" I figured I would try a chiropractor, of course the first place to come to mind was "Emergency chiro-practic, the kind of care, you want today!" I figured, this was an emergency, and I definitely want care today. I gave them a call and they clued me in that they only take emergency cases coming from something like an automotive accident, but they were nice enough to refer me to Dr. Steve.   By the time I got a hold of the good Dr, it was after hours and on Saturday, but after hearing that I was in such pain, Dr. Steve insisted that I meet him at his office so I wouldn't have to go the entire weekend before getting some relief. Which was super cool of him!  He immediately made my pain turn from a 12 out of 10 to more of a 4 or 5, and then set me up with a follow up appointment the next week. We got setup on a twice a week routine for a few weeks to take care of the immediate pain as well as help to restore my out of alignment spine. At the time, and this was a few years ago, he put on a cheesy new patient class which helped me learn all about the spine, how it worked, and why keeping it in line helps all functions of your body and also can prevent needing to take drastic measures like surgery, injections, or permanent prescription drugs. Yes it was cheesy, but I think I learned something from it.  I know I'm getting a little long winded at this point, but I assure you it's worth the read. After a few weeks of getting adjusted, I started to feel much less of the daily back pains that you normally just ignore, they're no big deal right?, I started to have more energy, and unexpectedly, I stopped having such negative reactions to eating dairy products. Weird, I know. Apparently, lining up your spine properly and allowing the electrical currents to properly flow through your nervous system also has the side benefit of helping your internal organs work as they were naturally created. Who knew. :-/  I have to give one big THANKS to Dr. Steve and his staff, maybe even a high five and a bro hug too; you really hooked me up and got me going again!  Happy yelping Phoenix, remember to say no to that nagging pain in your neck. ... and sorry guys, I'm not talking about your wives.
5 After a bad bicycle accident and subsequent surgery last July, I was referred to Cornerstone Physiotherapy by my surgeon. Jodi Arnott, my physiotherapist has been a great help to me by not only aiding me with mobilization and acupuncture, but also giving me practical strategies as to how I could continue with my physically demanding job that I could not take much time off from. She has been very encouraging. The girls at the front are always informed and pleasant, making a sometimes challenging visit a little nicer. Staff all seem to get along well with one another with makes for a great and friendly enviroment. Cornerstone is a very professional and convivial atmosphere to get well in.
5 I have been a patient of Mindful Motion for several months and I HIGHLY reccommend Jessica for post-operative care.   I came in for rehabilitation after a cervical spinal fusion surgery, opting for a more individualized PT setting outside of the hospital. I am so happy I made this decision. I knew from the moment I spoke with Jessica on the phone that she was highly knowledgable. I also knew I needed special and individualized attention after a year of pain and that is exactly what Jessica provided. She also extended open communication and real answers about my pain and the rehabilitation process ahead. This has been of great comfort to me along my journey to healing and gave me the knowledge to do more for my body during this process. Her one-on-one rehab techniques not only provide relief, but they condition your body to feel better for the long-term vs. a short term fix.   I have learned so much from Jessica about my condition and how to care for myself in the future. Nate is equally as accomodating and very laid-back, which is a really wonderful environment to walk into when you are in pain! Their beautiful rehab space doesn't hurt either :)  With their help, I was going from barely able to drive in July 2012  to traveling, and working out at the gym again Oct 2012.  Each day, I still feel better and I attribute so very much of it to Nate and Jessica at Mindful Motion.
5 Best place to go for a relaxing environment that is clean, and central. All RMTs are awesome! I've tried 4-5. All great!
5 Union Hills location review: My wife has been coming here for rehab after total  hip replacement. 3 sessions  a week , caring knowledgeable staff, equipment meets needs for the various types of injuries they treat. Would recommend  them in a heart beat. This is where my friend George came after back surgery. No complaints of any kind.
2 I stopped by for an Oseto appointment due to wrist pain.  I walked out in under 10 mins because the practitioner wanted to spend time telling me to lose weight for my non existent knee and ankle pain.  The follow up with the clinic owner was decent.  But I'm still here 4 days later trying to force my breakfast into me because disordered eating is a bag of dicks.  So I'm posting this here simply to provide a warning for those of us who get activated around size shaming.
1 Very horrible doctor doesn't deserve to have his license to practice he treats his patients very badly and his employees even worse I would never recommend this office to anyone I feel bad for the ones that do stay
5 Update on previous review: Office hasn't been crowded in months.  Far better experience in waiting area. The wait time is greatly improved down to more like 15 minutes in the waiting area and just a few minutes in the exam room to see her. I still like Dr Sbaih and her support and am especially glad I didn't move on. Upping my review to 5 stars  Previous review: Dr Sbaih saved my life. When I came to her as a new patient, she sent me for blood work to get started. I got it done on a Saturday and received a call from her at 4am Monday morning to get to the emergency room immediately.  I didn't realize it but I had been in rough shape.  I always appreciated the way she called and had to get a bit strong with me to convince me to go to the ER.   I needed it. Again, I appreciate her and that attentiveness.   That said, I agree with some of the other comments about wait times, etc. Dr Sbaih is great and super sharp but she is also WAY overbooked with too many patients to give the time she would want to. Each visit since that first time has averaged 2 hours in the waiting area and 45 min-1 hour more in the exam room waiting to see her.  That just seems long for a scheduled appointment. She's just over-extended. It is hard to decide to move on because I remember well the value of that 4am call but I think her current patient load is too much at this point.
4 Super helpful, conveniently located and with a pharmacy inside. It can't get any better than that.  Bay College Medical & Lockwood Diagnostic is on the south west side of Bay & College and is open six days a week.  My family doctor is here and when I show up for an appointment I am ALWAYS seen within a few minutes of arriving. Sometimes, when my family doctor is not available, I go to see the walk in which is equally prompt and all of the other doctors I have seen have been very pleasant and helpful.   The pleasant admin people behind the counter are always cheerful and make visiting the doctors office a better experience than it usually is when you're sick.
1 Do not go here no matter what. They will not fill out any paperwork for my employer which will result in my termination. It's their policy that they don't do paperwork.   Go anywhere else but UMC quickcares.
1 Er, no. I don't think so.  In the past I would visit  for minor or routine stuff, like a sore throat etc..  This time I jammed a finger during sports and though it was merely bruised. I go to see the nice doctor here. He has me go and get an X-Ray. I come back and it is confirmed to be broken.  Back where I'm from, when you break something, they immobilize it in a cast so that the bones can be properly aligned and fuse back together.    Here, the doctor tells me that we're going to 'buddy tape' the fingers.... 'buddy tape'? Hm what is that doctor? He assures me it is very commonly done in their practice and will take care of healing it... so I trust him.  He takes medical tape, wraps the broken finger along with the finger next to it. Then tells me we're done.  He asks me to come back for a follow up visit.   At the follow up visit, and follow up XRay...what do we find out? That when you 'tape' broken bones instead of solidly immobilizing them... the bones move around.. and they are not likely fuse back together.. and you end up with a limb that is F'ed for life. Why? Because bones will only fuse back together during a limited initial window of time.  Dr Palmer who used to see me before, sees me walk by  in the hallway after the follw-up. He turns beet-red and quickly looks away. Why? Not sure. Maybe aware of the f-up?  Following this disaster, I had to go see an orthopedic surgeon to salvage my finger.  He commented on what they had done and called them all kinds of names.  So that I would not end up with a permanently broken and floating finger, he operated and inserted several surgical pins (read: needles) that traversed the finger through and through. I had to keep the medieval pin torture going for weeks on end to try and get the bones back together after the nice doctor 'buddy taped' my fingers.  Over $10k in surgery and countless nights of suffering later, I have a finger that cannot bend normally and has lost gripping power - thanks to the doctor clown.  Some time later, I called North Scottsdale Family Medicine to report what had happened. At least they  should not repeat this moronic 'procedure' on other patients.  They had me talk to their practice manager who instead was in full 'malpractice battle mode'. I mentioned the ordeal they put me through. She was most interested in collecting evidence to counter any claim. I asked them if they would help pay for my surgery to recover my finger. Of course she denied any of it and started blaming me and using an accusatory tone.  She was relieved when she figured out that it had been too long for me to sue anyway. Whew! Yes, in Arizona you have a super short window to sue your doctor if they messed you up. Hmm I wonder who paid their golfing buddies to pass such a conveniently lenient and rewarding law?  I hope these folks go bankrupt. They are not the only ones with this dismal approach. They represent all that is wrong in our US medical system where doctors help themselves to your savings or else they let you suffer or even croak:   disrespectful 40 minute delays to show you your place in their 'universe' you show up on time and they still make you wait meaninglessly surperficial 12 minute visits: what are you going to 'diagnose' in 12 minutes mr genius doctor?  $75 for 12 minutes with the genius prices for services that are never posted and kept hidden to prevent you from shopping around prices for medical procedures and lab services are not posted take it or leave it prices and attitudes zero competition between doctors competition from international health plans is not allowed into the US doctors that don't know you, don't look you in the eye, are in it for the money only doctors that bill hundreds for a few minutes, then cry misery and that they can't keep up with the cost of providing services doctors that blame patients for getting sued for injuring them
3 I have been going to this practice  The whole appointment with blood tests took 1. 50 mins. And I am a VIP patient paying an extra $1,000 a year. Shame on the scheduler.
1 Hands down the most awful, dehumanizing experience of my life & I have gotten my annual/pap smear visit done every year since I was 16.   I waited over a month after reading reviews here to get see for my annual obgyn visit having recently moved to Las Vegas. I was very hopeful that I'd found my new doctor. The check in/new patient paperwork process went smoothly and my appointment was even timely - I was undressed and on the examination bed at 2pm, as scheduled. I was extremely nervous, but doctor Montoya came highly recommended from all of these reviews so I believed that this would be a good experience so I tried to be patient. 25 minutes went by when his assistant finally came back in along with doctor Montoya. I have never waited so long in a sterile cold examination room for any other doctor and I was definitely getting anxious but I tried to not be too nervous.   The doctor comes in and greets me, asks me to lay back and does the breast exam. Then he asked me if I want any birth-control which I thought was odd because no questions were ever asked about my sexual history or medical history for that matter. I told him I had been on nuvaring before, to which he replied "great, I don't even have to explain how to use it then." I used to work in the medical field and really have never heard such a lazy weird thing come out of a doctor's mouth, especially on the 1st visit. I was incredulous at this point.   The doctor then does the pap smear, with no warning that anything is gonna be inserted inside of me at that point. Again, I know why Im there but have some bedside manner, hello! He takes the culture, and then puts his hands inside of me and says  "oh yeah everything's there, it's good to go" and instructs me to go down the hallway to the lab to get my blood drawn. I could have broken-down in tears at that point, but I was in absolute disbelief and could not speak for fear of crying in front of the doctor and his unfazed medical assistant.   No questions were asked about my history or my needs during this visit. The doctor seemed to be in a weird mood and his assistant was no better and extremely unprofessional with her remarks the entire visit. Ugh.   I was also concerned that my doctor didn't even mention what the culture taken would be tested for. On every other annual visit that I've had, there was one culture taken for STDs and another taken for a cancer screening. The doctor mentioned neither while I was in the exam room.   After crying alone while getting dressed, I went to the lab room to have my blood taken. According to the lab technician doctor Montoya mostly deals with pregnancies and was in a very bad mood- how unlucky for me  since I'd taken the off of work, planned a month in advance for this visit & used my annual visit up on this crappy, unprofessional doctor who also refused to order the tests for my pap smear culture for the testing I actually came for! I got gardasil vaccinations years ago, which puts me at very low risk for cancer - I needed the culture to test for the standard yeast /stds and hiv screening- he would've known this if he asked me any questions, but nope, I wasn't worth the energy apparently. Ridiculous.   Ladies- do not subject yourself to the torture of going here for an annual visit - this is already a difficult yearly situation for most women to deal with an office of rude human beings on top of it all!   I was able to speak to the OB advisor (I cried again in her office) on staff as the manager was out of the office, who was very understanding and recommended much better doctors for my annual visit.    I'm beyond upset because now I'll have to pay for another exam since nothing I needed was done and my annual visit is used up now through my insurance and take another day off of work.
4 I've been getting body wraps for a long time and this by  far was the best. I will most definitely be going on a regular basis.  The staff was very friendly and professional. Very attentive.
1 I went a few months back because I was certain I had depression. After telling the doctor how I felt and explained my situation I was just prescribed some meds. I'm not sure how depression is diagnosed, but I'm sure this is not the way. I was just prescribed some meds extremely quick the exact same day as first visit and started taking them.   After the first month I felt nothing because the first batch of meds is a low dose on purpose because it's depression meds and has to be built up in dose. After I went up in dose I started to notice the side effects the main being my sexual relationship with my girlfriend. This was a normal side effect I knew that going in. I then started to get a rash on my hands that made my hands very rough and dry looking 24/7. I then called the doctors office one day to ask if this was a side effect from the meds. I missed the doctor on the phone so the receptionist called me back and said the doctor said "no it's not a side effect and not to worry". Fast forward to me wanting to get off the meds because it was affecting my relationship with my girlfriend. My last interaction with a nurse they told me "the rash on hands would clear up after meds were out of my system".   So my question is: How is it not a side effect like I was told but it'll clear up after meds are out of my system? Kind of describes side effect by definition does it not?   So yea I'm never going back here again.
5 I recently moved to Chandler and was referred to this place from a friend. I've been having back pain for months which has kept me from the gym and certain daily activities as well as loss of sleep (my back was ruining my life)! I couldn't be more happy now!! My back is finally back to normal, I can exercise again and get a full nights sleep, yay!   The staff is very friendly, knowledgable and helpful. Dr. Que is amazing, professional and clearly knows what he's doing. They get you in and out and the overall experience is great! I saw a couple Chiropractor's in LA and neither helped my back so I'm VERY happy Custom Chiropractic exists since I was about to resort to possible surgery!   I highly recommend!
2 In reviewing my bill I found a couple charges that weren't tasks completed during my appointment.    They told me that they found services I received several weeks back and needed to charge me.   I explained I pay cash every week and keep no records but feel I have paid the correct amount every time and have never felt undercharged I promise you that.   Well, in the end they offered to take 50.00 off which was less than 20% of the fee.   I paid them off, literally.... to make it go away.   I will not go back.
5 Very impressed with Dr Paul Hepworth!! Took the time to listen and help me. Not to impressed with the front office staff. Rude and short which seems to be a common thing among many reviewers. Thank you Dr Hepworth for making my visit and enjoyable one.
1 Don't go here. The receptionists are not helpful and the doctor doesn't care. I hurt my back and they were the first doctor that came up on my insurance search. I waited for an hour in the waiting room in pain. Then they notified me they would not prescribe pain killers on the first visit. What the?! I'm in pain and you don't want to help me? Doctors are worthless.
5 Dr.Lee and his staff are amazing! I had a free consultation and out went great he was very patient with me and answered all my questions and really took his time. I felt very comfortable and never felt pressure at all he really listens to you and cares. I was really scared I've never had any cosmetic procedure done before. I had cheek fillets which was virtually pain free! I was also scared about bruising and scarring because I tend to hyperpigmentate. I was slightly sore for 1 day no scars and no bruising. I can't wait for my next appointment! The result is natural and beautiful. If you want the best, Dr. Lee is the best their  is! Im so glad I found him!
5 I cannot say enough about how wonderful PPT is but I will try and give you a few examples of why I rate them so highly.  I was referred to PPT.  From the moment I called, the help I received in working with my daughter's schedule to get her in quickly and helping with my insurance was already way above the bar compared to others I called.   People aren't kidding or exaggerating when they talk about the feeling of 'family' when you are there.  They were genuinely interested in my daughter as a person which made her feel very comfortable, they kept up her life events, hobbies, and activities and gave advice on how to keep her injury at bay consistent with her lifestyle, they always got her started if she was early and never ended on the dot just because her time was up.     Best of all I am seeing a major difference on foot & ankle problems she has been having for 2+ years.  Don't waste your time anywhere else where someone will just throw your child in a boot and send them off.   This is a place that is genuinely interested in finding solutions for long term healing and teaching skills to avoid future injury.  They treated everyone I witnessed there (including my very energetic 6 y/o who often had to wait on his sister) with the same respect, kindness, and care.  Preferred Physical Therapy is in a class by itself - top notch.
5 On a scale from 1 to 10, and 10 being the best, I rate my experience with Lenzmeier Family Medicine a 20! From the receptionist, to the PA, to the Dr it was a great experience! Everyone was friendly, professional, and caring. The Dr was kind, professional, listened to my concerns, and was on time!!!!! I am so happy to have found this office and truly appreciate the quality medical attention and customer service I received! Do NOT hesitate to go to this office! There are so few good Doctors out there, this one is too good I had to get the word out!!!
4 Superb health clinic.  Why?..  1. It's conveniently located by the ttc.  2. Waiting area, front desk, offices, and washrooms are always clean.  3. Fast - Wait times are usually anywhere from 15-25min.  4. All hail technology because all patient records are electronic, meaning any doctor you see will have all the information they need, and updated everytime you see a new doctor. 5. Efficient - All doctors are thorough with the check ups.  6. Even better if you can have one as a family doctor!   *The reason I only gave it four stars was because of their phone line. No one answers the damn phone. But if you leave a message, they will call back or leave a message.   (And weekend hours would be nice..)   If it was easier to contact Patients Network then it would definitely be five stars!   Overall, I would definitely recommend this clinic to everyone~!
1 I've been going there for nearly two years with no problems and through some administrative quirk of a missing $129 they "discharged" me from the system and won't reinstate my account.   Doctor Davey is a great doctor but the practice is bogus considering that they will drop you in a second over $129.   I guess it's the doctors that take the Hippocratic oath, not the practice.
5 I tweaked my neck last week working out and was in some serious pain and couldn't turn my head for a couple of days. I found Platinum health online and booked an appointment with the chiropractor who was able to take me in the same day. I have never used a chiropractor before in the past but a friend told me to go so I gave it a shot.  I got an assessment and treatment by Dr.Albert who was  excellent. He did some adjustments and massage work on my neck and back which instantly relieved my symptoms. I walked out of there being able to turn my head again and best of all pain free!   Also they do direct billing to my insurance so its super convenient!! I've returned a few times and I highly recommend the clinic.
5 I just changed my PCP due to conflicts with my previous family practice. I actually got to see Dr. Homewood, he was incredibly professional. It is a smaller office but it gives you the hometown feeling that this office cares. It means a lot coming from my last experience. See you guys soon
5 I am a nanny and have been taking my charge here for occupational therapy for over 3 years now. We attend a 50 minute session once a week. I absolutely love the facilities here! They have a theater room in the middle of the building with one way mirrors so you can watch and listen to your child's session without them seeing or hearing you. This is perfect so you can stay in the loop and observe the progress being made, but not distract your child during their session. The rooms are equip with tons of tools the therapists utilize to improve your child's daily living skills. They have rooms that are designed to simulate real life situations, such as a kitchen. They also have rooms that have climbing and gross motor equipment, as well as tactile items to work on fine motor skills. Every day is something new at the Clubhouse, which keeps the children engaged and excited to come back. Gavin has a huge smile every day while we are in route to visit Miss Tiffany, his amazing occupational therapy there. We are so proud of Gavin's progress he's made since we started going to the Clubhouse, and appreciate all of the hard work and effort that's been made on his behalf by the team there.
1 Steer clear away from here unprofessional completely I've been calling since 345 no answer or pickup but says they don't close til 5 ... how does that work... then when they did pick up the phone i was transferred to a line where they didn't pick up... wtf
1 I don't think this doctor even deserves a rating as high as 1. He is a typical pill pusher. I went to him for severe back pain which I have been seeing a chiropractor for for some time. He did not listen to my complaints but just prescribed pain meds which is what I have been trying to avoid. And he has the mist horrible bedside nanner. Worse experience ever!
1 Last week the receptionist was amazing. Today another is slow and RUDE. Tried to charge me for my pre-paid B shot and when I try to explain that it was prepaid she just huffed and told me to sit and wait cuz she had to check because she doesn't know anything about that. I get the chance to double check but should have been nicer about it in addition she's not making me wait while she does everything administrative.   it's ridiculous!
4 These guys were great. Always felt better after each session. Would definitely keep going.   The only complaint if at all would be the trainer would give you an exercise and leave to check on other folks. You would have to do the reps on your own and wait until he/she comes back to give you the next set of exercises. I would prefer a one on one and the trainer /therapist to always monitor and not leave you to workout on your own.
5 I've been with Dr Lee ever since moving to AZ in 2006. He is caring, compassionate and easy to talk to. He is very detailed in his assessment and excellent at diagnosis and treatment. If your condition is out of his sphere, he has great recommendation of other physician, who are just as qualified and professional as Dr. Lee.  His front office staff is very professional and inviting. They make every effort to make you feel welcomed. I'm very grateful for Dr. Lee and his staff!
5 I just have to say I have been going here for almost 4 years now and seeing Doug Turner and I  am always confident I will get the best of care. All the doctors and staff are very friendly and efficient. I would definitely recommend them to everyone I know and have many times  Great Job!!!!!
2 I only gave this location 2 stars due to the billing errors. Some of my payments made to my account with receipts were never reflected. Every time I call I get a different amount due. I have been trying to get this resolved for several months with no luck. The office manger at this location will not engage this issue. While the Physical Therapists are great I would suggest not using Physiotherapy Associates (now Select Physical Therapy). I may need to engage legal help if i can't get this resolved. I am not going to pay for something twice.
5 I went in to see Mary with neck, shoulder, and back troubles.  She did a great job of not only helping me to feel better, but she also educated me on what was wrong and how to prevent it in the future.  Without a doubt, I would recommend her to all.
2 I called today to see if I could get my husbands appt. moved sooner than July 29th as he is having pain with severe acid reflux.  I was told by the receptionist since he hasn't been there in a while that that she can't get him in any sooner with any of the providers.  Really? Because he hasn't been there in a while? She suggested if he needed to be seen sooner that we go to urgent care.  All he needed was a referral to the gastroenterologist.  Terrible customer service at the front desk.
5 Dr Ryan Wilk is bringing patients the greatest chiropractic has to offer in the NorthWest Phoenix Valley! You will feel the positive enhancements in your life just by being in his caring presence! His intelligence and focus in providing premiere care to families is remarkably outstanding! Give yourself and opportunity and contact Dr Ryan Wilk at "Ryno Family Chiropractic".
5 We absolutely love Dr Cleary. He has been my doctor for 16 years and delivered both my children. He's very old school and honest and I like that in a doctor. He's funny too!! My kids love seeing him.
2 Very clean facility! The front desk lady was super nice as was the X-ray technician. Unfortunately all the great customer service stopped as soon as P.A. Randall Sorrentino came in the room. My boyfriend, who never complains of pain, was experiencing back pain and this guy came in like a robot with his questions and didn't seem to have any compassion for the pain he was in. My boyfriend specifically told him he has previously been prescribed Flexorall and it wasn't helpful with the pain, so what did Randall prescribe...Flexorall!! He then went on to tell him to do some neck/back stretches but never gave him any examples that would help stretch the specific area of pain. Everyone but Randall was nice and compassionate. Randall needs to work on his active listening skills and bedside manner!
5 Awesome doctor! Reasonable price, staff is friendly and he process Is very fast. Very much recommended!
5 I've actually had 2 MDs here:  Dr. Schafer and Dr. To.  Thanks to Schafer I am now able to use my right shoulder which had been frozen due to lack of good care from 2 other doctors.  Then Dr. To is my new "hand" guy-as I have RA and Dupuytren's Contracture.  He has fixed my trigger thumb.  Both men are fantastic!  Plus, Dr. Schafer sent me to the best PT around-Aris.  And Dr. To went to school and studied with the same surgeons as my hand MD in Orange County, CA
5 Dr. Gibb and the PT team provide exceptional care...  They take time to explain your situation and exactly what will be done to correct what is wrong.   The patient service team is courteous and accommodating.... I highly recommend Springbok Chiro and PT.
1 My 14yr old was referred by his pediatrician. I walked in & there was a line of about 10 people,  not to mention the 30+ people in the waiting room. I was given 20 pages of paperwork and a pager! You would think that these would be mailed in advance. As i finally done with the forms, the pager went off. I handed in the paperwork and shortly after called back.   The young lady/medical asst wasnt very friendly. As she pulled up his info in the room, she asked "did you already have an xray done today? I responded "was my son supposed to? She didn't respond! She walked out, and the Dr walked in. He was very pleasant. We were there all of 5 mins. Mind you, my son's condition is mild. Anyway as we left i asked another young lady for my son's dr's card, seemed little annoyed that she had to go grab one off a different desk. Needless to say, we wont be returning.
5 I had such an amazing experience with Dr. Hogan and awesome staff! They are all so friendly and really took great care of me and my boyfriend after our car accident. Here you can tell that they really care about your health/well-being. There's never a long wait and service is great, I always feel my best after leaving the office. Recommend Dr Hogan as the best chiropractor and physician in the valley :)
5 I am so blessed to have finally found a doctor who has figured out my complex blood results and normalized my lipid panel by addressing the root cause (and not just slapping down a statin in front of me like every other doc I have seen). My a1c is down to 5.4 thanks to her guidance (and a lot of hard work of course) and without hypos and hypers masking the result.  She takes time to listen to her patients, has a whole body/integrative mindset and offers real solutions.  If you are looking for a doc who just writes whatever script you want, she is probably not your doc as she really works hard to pinpoint each problem and address it systemically.  And it works.  I feel like a million bucks now. Her office is run efficiently - never had issues with waiting times or appts.  Only thing I would like better is to have more immediate online access to my lab results (they seem to take a very long time to publish), but this may be more of a lab issue than a dr issue.
5 Great place for physical therapy. Everyone is nice and they teach you things you can do at home to improve. I had pelvic physiotherapy after having twins. They also worked on my abdominal diastasis. One happy customer!
5 Came here after a car accident. Dr. David and Patty are awesome! They genuinely care about you and your life. I saw them 3 times a week for 3 months. I was sad when I was done because the staff are awesome and super friendly. I'm really glad I made the choice to come here after looking into other places.   They are also pros at what they do. Dr. David and Master Patty can tell right away where I was having pain just by touching. They are like magicians. Lol
5 Great doctor. MD and a homeopath which is a great combination. Highly recommend. He has a big heart and is good with all ages. He gets most of his patients from word of mouth which I also like because his patients love him. I'm one of them and love him too!
1 The worst experience I've had a doctor's office (and I work in healthcare).  I went to Pueblo for my annual physical and made the appointment with Dr. Cunningham. I arrived and was told I would be seen by Nurse Practitioner Kozak. Umm...okay, sure. TO her credit, she was very thorough and nice so I didn't mind. After seeing her though it went quickly downhill. I was told to wait in the waiting area (After I had already been seen) and after an hour, I went to the front desk and said I needed to leave to go to work and if I could just get my LabCorp lab form. They apologized and within 5 minutes it was given to me. Again, not certain why it took me saying something. Okay....I got my labs done that same day and a few days later I call to see if my results are available. They state they can't discuss any results over the phone. I ask if they have a patient portal online (like most places), they do not. I ask if a Nurse or NP can call me back for results, they can not. They say I need to set up an appointment for results given to me in person. I reluctantly do so for a 7am appointment a few days later with the same NP Kozak. I show up at 7 and I'm told I will be seeing a different NP (?) and I have a $20 co payment. Ummm..okay. An hour later it is 8 am and I still have not been seen. During that time, the patient lobby is filled with elderly, angry people (I kinda know why now). I head up to the receptionist and tell him it's been an hour and he said he is sorry and they will see me soon. I say okay and sit down. I then create a LabCorp account online so I could see my results in the mean time. 5 minutes later, I see my results are all good so I'm not sure if this appointment is necessary. Another patient comes to me while I'm seated and tells me that Dr. Cunningham Jr. is only in the clinic twice a month and that he is a jerk it has been going downhill since he took over the practice. He tells me that at his last appointment he was one of the last patients to be seen for the day and they left him in an exam room and turned off the clinic lights and locked him in the building. He had to call the fire department to let him out. Whaaaat???! While listening to this, a young African lady from Bhutan comes in and signs the sign-in sheet. An elderly lady walks in after her and stands behind her in line. Within a minute or two, the impatient elderly lady yells at the woman from Bhutan saying, "what are you doing writing a book? Don't you know your name in your country?" A few of the elderly folks sitting start laughing. I am sitting there thinking wtf then another lady with glasses behind the receptionist comes around and says to the lady from Bhutan,  "you need to know your name ma'am and if you don't you need to get out of line and let others sign in" and then walks away. The poor lady from Bhutan answers in broken English, "I'm from Bhutan and I know my name it just takes me a little while to fill in the form." and then she sits down near me. I tell the lady from Bhutan that I'm sorry she has to deal with such rude people. At 8:15, I walk back up and say I need to leave so I can get to work on-time. While saying this, the lady with glasses is in the back of the office and I hear her yelling at someone saying "well, you need to do your job or you can get another one." The male receptionists apologizes to me and I then ask who the lady with glasses was. He says, oh the manager? THE MANAGER. I ask for her card and I see her name is "KIMBERLY TITUS"  and I tell him that she is extremely rude and unprofessional for a manager. I then walk to the old lady who spoke rudely to the woman from Bhutan who is sitting down and I tell her she's a racist who needs to learn some patience and I then walk out as she mutters something to me incoherently. Unbelievable. I then speak to another friend of mine who used to go there and he confirms that the worst part were the ridiculous wait times and the need for constant follow-up appointments in order to say everything is fine after collecting yet another co-payment. In short, Dr. Cunningham basically doesn't exist though his name is all over the building, the manager is an unprofessional manager and a generally horrible person, they play drug infomercials non-stop on their 1 tv in the lobby (yay for pushing pharmaceuticals), the wait time is beyond ridiculous, they are inefficient when it comes to dealing with lab results or follow-up (why not have a patient portal or have a nurse call patients in for a results to lessen this patient overbooking issue??), and to add to this the patients are a mix of inpatient old and racist or homeless or immigrants and so in the 2 times I've been there I've witnessed a number of uncomfortable and controversial spats with nothing being done..... The only pros are staff (not manager) seemed nice (NP Kozak, the MAs, the receptionist, and the pulmonologist)--unfortunately, the negatives spoil it all. RUN FAR AWAY.
5 Effective treatment. Well run office; everyone very personable and friendly.  Dr Day serious and skilled. Knows his stuff. Fixed a back problem for me in three visits.
1 I love the doctor here however the wait times are excessive. Because of that I will probably find a new primary care doctor
4 This is the building on the Southeast corner of 7th Street and Indian School, on the 2nd floor; their office is way in the back. I called one day and asked to make an appointment, they advised it was not needed. So I came in on a Saturday at 10:00am but they were busy and wouldn't take me.   I returned on a Tuesday afternoon at about 1pm and filled out the paperwork, waited about 5 minutes and met Dr Corrigan, who was professional an courteous. I had a weird itch on my arms from daily swimming. He prescribed something, it worked, and everything is fine now.  It only took about 20-25 minutes from walking in to me walking out. I'd call ahead if you plan to visit and see what kind of wait is expected, unless you live close.
5 I have been into this location a few times and my most recent visit has been the best by far.. There is usually a lady in the front I think her name is Amanda? she is really good and a pleasure to see every time i go in but i was surprised to see a gentleman in the front I believe his name was Corey. He was so nice and got my paperwork done so fast. When i got called to the room Isaias was AWESOME!! The doctor was great and very helpful as well.. Definitely recommend!!
5 I came here on February 15th for a post-Valentine's day facial with my boyfriend. We found a groupon online for their 24-karat gold facial ($39) and decided to give it a whirl. The facial is performed by two women. Both perform different techniques to set/prep the face before use of the 24k gold. Never in my life have I ever felt so pampered!  These ladies really know how to make you feel like a Queen (or King!). They used a combination of hydrotherapy, light therapy, among other techniques before setting the face for the 24-karat gold facial. The 24-karat gold technique requires it to set on your face for approximately 25 minutes before it is peeled off. After the facial, my skin felt smooth and looked great. My boyfriend, who can be a little macho at times, even said the same thing, haha. Men, don't be shy to get this done - there's nothing wrong with great skin! And ladies, encourage your gents to go, as it is a wonderful experience that you can enjoy together.  Both were very kind enough to let us take pictures of each other getting the facials for our scrapbook, as my boyfriend was visiting from the United States. :)  As an added bonus for me, they used these special rocks (I can't remember the name of the technique) that are applied to different pressure points on the body to reduce chronic fatigue and alleviate my mood. Every time that I smiled or felt happy, these rocks would warm up the pressure points on my body, giving me a "warm and fuzzy" feeling, too! For about 24 hours after I left, even without the rocks, every time I felt happy or smiled, the same pressure points would continue to warm up. It was a great feeling, and I really do feel like it helped, as I haven't been tired in the least, even with little to no sleep since the facial. I was told at the time, though, that the "feel good" feeling can last 2-3 days post-experience.  I definitely, without a doubt, recommend that you see these ladies about getting the 24-karat gold facial. You will need to make an appointment ahead of time and it is recommended that you fill out a facial profile to determine your skin type/how well you can tolerate some of the facial techniques that they provide.
1 I came in here at 2am to be seen for a horrendous sore throat that hadn't been letting up for a few days. After being there for 3 hours, the doctor told me I was suffering from post-nasal drip, and there was nothing to help me. I ended up calling in sick to work the next day, and at 10am called my PCP. Thankfully, I was told to come in right away. Upon being seen by him, he took one good look at my throat, told me I had a bad case of bronchitis and laryngitis, gave me a 3 day Z-pack, and I started to feel better just hours later.  Thanks for nothing, Concentra. Including wasting my money for no actual services received!
3 Despite a multiple month issue regarding FMLA paperwork which was a very bad experience,  the escalation system to corporate to resolve our issue was at least sufficient to resolve the problem. While I still do not recommend this particular location, the company's commitment to improving this process and quick response to my escalation call for an adjustment to my original review.
1 I wouldn't even give 1 star if I had a choice. When this was Dr. Cadavals office it was amazing!! Great front staff, great wait times just a wonderful experience I have not received from any other doctors office.. Now that the new owners took over UGH!!!! The front desk staff are the most rude girls I have every experienced at a doctor before, there attitude and lack of compassion are horrible!!! Jamie is literally the only person left from Dr. Cadavals practive and the only one I still get respect from. They sit behind the desk and talk in Spanish and look right at you as if you have any idea of what they are saying!!! The doctor just plain out sucks!! She rushes everything, doesn't listen to concerns and tells you to see your other specialist for any questions!!! Why are you here if you can't answer questions?? This doctor and her front desk girls are just a complete joke!! I would definitely hire them as a group of clowns for my 3 year Olds birthday party but defintaly would not hire them for health care providers!!
1 in the last week The black lady in the front has no idea about her job! She charged me for she said its for the labs, but when i called their office billing department and my insurance they both told me what She charged me was for office visit. I didnt see the doctor I came in for labs. They said they have mandatory nurse visit where they take vitals signs prior drawing your labs but the black lady did not know about it! I even asked her 3 times if it was for the labs she said yes its for the labs each time. If i only knew I'm paying extra then I would have went to regular quest. Now I'm paying twice since they wouldn't refund my money even though it was their fault for giving me false information!. Office visit and labs. She also have an attitude! That black lady should not be even working up front!
1 I went in for Inpatient for help with depression voluntarily, what I did not expect was the jail-like atmosphere. If they try to send you to Adult 5 level DO NOT GO!!! There is NO HELP, staff does bare minimal and just "goes through the motion" and does not address any issues patients have and just hand you medication as the answer. The nurses tried to give me medication and when I refused they tried to tell me it was prescribed by the dr., who I had never met! Let alone it was a highly addictive medication and no one had explained to me why I was being prescribed to take it. And to add to horror a fight broke out between two patients in the first 5 min I was there and staff did nothing to resolve it besides putting one person in the "non-padded room" without addressing why the two were in conflict. Making it the nurses entertainment for the night. Not wanting to give up hope and get help I asked to be discharged or to move to another unit. The next day I was moved to detox unit, where the only thing that was consistent were the 6am vital checks, snack breaks and smoke breaks. There were hardly any interactions with the nurses and doctors with the patients. On the board the nurses write a full day filled with group therapy, meals, activities, etc., and the only thing that was really offered were the meals. After being there for two days I felt worse than when I had gone in. So by the third day to save my sanity and what little hope I had left, I DEMANDED to be discharged. To add insult to injury when I got the medical bill for 5,000 for three days in hell it made me sick to my stomach. Any advice I can give is that staff does not care, it's dirty, and don't take medication without questioning....the pluses are free cable and food is descent. Be ready for a 5 hr wait to get in and out of all the nurses only two treated me like a real person.
5 We have been going to SpeakEasy for the past year. My three year old son sees Natalie for speech and Nick for Occupational therapy. They are both really great with my son. He actually looks forward to his weekly visits. Besides the therapist being great the staff is really kind and friendly and I have never had a problem getting a appointment or cancelling one. They are very accommodating. I would really recommend SpeakEasy
1 I would give less than one star if I could. I have repeatedly been given the run around by office staff for simple requests. Most recently, when I was unable to get someone on the phone for more than a few seconds being asked to be placed on hold, I visited in person. Dr Wachs herself, who in previous visits had seemed pleasant, instead basically said she would no longer treat me. She seemed very frazzled and lost her composure. She said they were closing and she couldn't do anything for me. Yet I told her I had been calling all day. I was very uncomfortable with her and her staff telling me to leave and that I needed to seek treatment elsewhere when all I did was politely ask for them to fax something to my insurance.  I felt a homophobic undertone because the drug I required approval for was Truvada. There's even a typed-up sign posted on the wall at check-in stating that they dont discriminate against certain groups of people, excluding sexual orientation. I thought that was strange.
1 Receptionist was rude everytime I called. I never received any of my calls back after leaving countless voicemails. One particular problem I had was getting a simple name and phone number of someone THEY referred me to. Receptionist refused to take 2 minutes of her time to get this simple info out of my chart. No one from referrals ever called me back. The 4th time I called, a month had gone by and finally the receptionist gave the information after I became irritated. The PA always looks unhappy with her job, and seems to be in a rush. Plan on changing my care soon. I am very flexible as long as there is a decent level of professionalism. There seemed to be a lack of that at Mckellips Family Medical. Was planning on bringing in my husband, but plan on finding him a place with better quality of care.
5 I have been dealing with lower back pain for a long time.  I have seen a lot of different therapists, but no one was able to get my back better except Jon.  His unique approach to getting to the root of the dysfunction in my body was amazing. A lot of times therapists focus only on the area of pain, but Jon made me understand that just because I had pain in my back it wasn't my back that was the problem. Restrictions in other areas of my body were causing the muscles in my back to work harder. After a few sessions and now periodic visits and self stretches that he taught me, keep me pain free!  Jon is a master of his craft and I highly recommend anyone that suffers from any kind of aches and pains to go see him. You will not be disappointed!
3 My feelings are a bit mixed. They happened to come by the office and give 10-15min massages which I found to be super awesome gesture to offer their services but not sure I like their tactic. Let me explain...  Well the girl I had was super nice & friendly, but in comparison to my past massages, she didn't really have a good pressure method. I explained to her I had a higher pain tolerance, and personally need pressure to have it feel relieving aka good- she explained to me that to have high pain tolerance wasn't good, and pressure isn't necessarily good.  Not saying the customer is always right, but I was seeing a chiropractor at one time after a car accident for about 6-9 months and the pressure was F'n amazing, so I beg to differ with her practice.   So in regards to the tactic. After you're done with the massage they have you sit down with another individual who goes over the 'form' that you explain your issues that you checked, ya know the ones stating; neck pain, pinched nerves, low back pain, etc.  I told her I really didn't have any problems or issues, it's just at random that the pulled muscle comes in here and there. She provided me with a voucher to come in for a free 20minute massage, free dr exam and free xrays. I wanted to decline the appointment bc to be quite frank I know how it works. They suck you in and advise you have a 'plethora of issues' and to correct these issues you need to commit to a series of appointments. I have a few friends whom do massage whom I trust to be in their hands and a regular monthly massage will be good for me. Not knocking the chiropractor at all, but the tactic seems to be a vicious cycle. Just saying.
1 We tried this location after we tried the Jones location hoping that it would be less crowded and the good news it was less crowded but the therapist was horrible. I ended my child's session early because I couldn't be in the room any longer with the therapist. I was really trying to like this company since it was referred to us by our pediatrician but now I will never go back.
1 The only reason I'd give this place even one star is because of the physical/occupational therapists. If your parent/grand/or self had a knee replacement etc you should be fine, but if your parent is a stroke patient who needs good medical care along with PT as mine was, forget it!  The Drs and nursing staff are completely incompetent. My mother suffered her second set of small strokes while in this facility and on the day I noticed her decline I asked the nurse for Dr. Cheng to come in and assess her. Instead, I received a phone call from Dr. Cheng a couple hours later and when I voiced my concern and told him I've seen her after stroke in the past, and I was quite sure that's what was happening,  all he could say was that she was on the choice of medication for her condition and if we took her to the hospital there isn't much else to be done and that they would keep an eye on her for worsening symptoms.  Instead of trusting my gut, I trusted his recommendation. By the next morning her stroke was so bad she looked dead when I entered the room. She lay in the bed, mouth and eyes open staring into nothingness.  The CNA was busy next to her getting her ready to be put into the shower!  I immediately left the room and went to the front desk demanding my mom be transferred to the hospital.  Upon her transfer we found that she had indeed suffered multiple more small strokes and the clincher is,  if she had gone to the hospital the day before when I had spoken to Dr cheng, they would have immediately put her on a heparin drip to resolve any clots she had in order to leason the stroke and damage!  Because I thought this was the best place in the las Vegas valley based on Google and health grades  I actually allowed her to return 9 days after the second strokes.  This time she only lasted a little better than a day, as the intake nurse incorrectly entered her Coumadin dosage in the system so her INR (protective level of blood clotting) plummeted to an unsafe and non therapeutic number leaving her wide open for more stroke!  Along with that, she developed a very serious UTI that also effected her mental status.  I wouldn't send my enemy to this place!  We're now in advanced health care and I'm still getting a feel for the care level here. I know I'm probably a nightmare patient advocate after all of this, but when you pay the money it takes to keep them in these facilities the care should be reflective.
5 I first visited Dr. Farian and the wonderful folks at Junction Health last summer (2016). I was training for my first ultramarathon and needed support for my training. Dr. Farian was quick to provide some helpful tips on proper strength training techniques which showed quick results.   In addition to this, Dr. Farian's team supported me with acupuncture and massage therapy.   I ended up successfully completing my first ultra last fall and Dr. Farian's team was a huge part of this.   Thanks to the team for all of the support!
5 Thanks to my physiotherapist Jane, Dr Kong, and the rest of the team here I have recovered extremely well from a car accident where I injured my hip at the back close to my tail bone from being rear ended as a passenger.   I went from limping and feeling pain in my hip and back when sitting for only a few minutes to being able to go back to doing Muay Thai and hitting the gym at full throttle. As long as I don't overdo it physically, I'm good and feel no pain or discomfort. If I overdo it and it's cold outside then I'll feel a bit of discomfort but for the most part I'm fine.   I had told my personal trainer at the gym who was doing a fitness assessment that I had been in a car accident, and she thought I had a great physiotherapist since I showed little issue for someone who had been injured, and I was thinking "Yes! You're right," so I thought it would only be appropriate to leave a favourable review and let the world know how great she was. I'm pretty much perfect, I just have some issues with balancing on one leg (either of them) during yoga at the gym but my balance before wasn't exactly amazing, and I see others in the class struggling with balance too so I don't feel handicapped in any way, but it is something I will work on, likely with a trainer.   This was my first experience with physiotherapy and I'm a true believer.  I can't thank this place enough for giving me my life back.
5 We came here for my husband's gastric surgery. From pre-registration to intake to surgical care it has been personable care. We really like this hospital!
5 This office is so sweet and knowledgeable. I randomly had a rib out of place which caused so much pain, and made me nervous deciding who to go to and how they would fix it and what price tag. The chiropractors and their assistants know what they're doing and were able to x ray and completely fix my rib and relieve my pain.   I've been going here on a regular basis for the past 7 months now and taking the fish oils they recommended for my scoliosis, what a huge difference. Extremely cost efficient also because they have low prices and payment plans on top of that.   Only downfall is the entrance driving into the parking lot is tight when trying to turn in and the office is closed on weekends. But they do offer earlier and later appointments on certain days to try and accommodate before/after work and rush hour. Great place for a quick fix or long term maintenance, they are honest and thorough!
5 My dad has been here twice now and it's the nicest (least depressing) skilled nursing place I've seen.  My father has also been in another faciltiy in Scottsdale and I've toured quite a few.... there is no comparison for cleanliness and attentiveness.  Yes, this place costs lots more than the other facilities (around $600 a day) compared to other places that charge half that.  Medicare (and his supplement) covered the cost for my dad but if you had to pay out of pocket or had private health insurance with a co-pay, you might find it too expensive.  The food is the best too, although it is, like all these places,  institutional... so it's not going to be gourmet.   I suggest ordering off the daily menu and getting fruit plates, hamburgers, etc.    As for other's comments on getting in, it's not easy sometimes.  They have lots of people who want to be there.  Many of their clients, for example, know they are having surgery so they schedule Advanced ahead of time.  So contrary to what another reviewer said, it's usually a mix of old and young people, though mostly old.  That's usually who needs skilled nursing. The first time my dad was to go there, they didn't have a room at either their Mesa or their Scottsdale faciltiy, so they took him at Glendale for a few days then transferred him in their van to Scottsdale when a room became available.  If there is a line to get in, I think they usually take the person who is discharged from the hospital first.  We thought he was going to Scottsdale first, for example, but the hospital ended up keeping him another day and we lost our slot.  One thing I really do like about this place is that it's only a short-term skilled nursing facility so they don't have any long term residents to focus on.  It's all about re-hab and OT here.    My dad had  previously developed a sore on his back so he loved the temperpedic (sp) mattresses.  The mattress is a very big deal to my dad.  I felt a mattress at all the other places... some were hard and lumpy.  At the latest stay, they used an air bed on top of the mattress for his sore.  That makes a huge difference.    As for over-medicating, everything my dad takes comes from his primary care doctor or his other physicians.  There is an Advanced doctor who seems to be in and out but everytime we've asked him for something the nurses at Advanced have referred us to our doctor.     If you are considering a skilled nursing facillity you really do need to take tours.  One facility, for example, has a smoking area for patients who are smokers.  It's not good to be a smoker in a skilled nursing home, of course, but if you were a smoker that would be important.  One faciltiy said they have patients who come there because they have 3 smoke breaks a day instead of 2 at other places.  Also you might want to ask about eating... Advanced wants you in the dining room socializing with others.  Another place I looked at allowed people to eat in their rooms if they wanted.   I decided against one skilled nursing facility because the entire time I was there, a call button was going off.  At one point I asked the director who was giving me the tour if anyone was going to answer it.  He said, "Oh, is that bothering you?  Do you want me go go answer it?"    So all in all, it's the best facility around if you can afford it or if you prefer more luxury.
1 4 years here and they've gone down the drain big time. Used to be an amazing place but it's time for me to move on.
5 Dr. Bottner has been fantastic to me. He and his staff have answered all my questions, seen me in a timely manner and suggested excellent specialists when necessary. I would highly recommend Dr. Bottner.
5 She is a great family practice doctor.  Whenever I needed to get in to see her, they always worked me in that day...which in my experience is almost unheard of with most practices in Phoenix.  She is very nice and easy to talk to.  She listens to what you have to say and I never felt like I was being rushed.  I would highly recommend her if you are looking for a doctor in the North Scottsdale area.
2 One star more than the person below me. Here is why.   I come on time for an appointment , I come early in fact and you are 3 hours late. Im sorry I find it hard to respect you if you cannot respect my time. I work way too many hours to be wasting it in a front office after I have made an appointment a week or a month or a day ahead even. Thats not done.   The front office is not the friendliest behind their glass wall and I have personally dealt with better staff.   The physician, Dr Sobel, himeself is a very nice person. (Maybe I met the better Sobel, I think there are 3 !) He was very amicable, and while he does run in and out of the office, and after the wait I wasnt expecting anything great. (Talk about low expectations)  I cannot say he does an exception job diagnosing / treating because I never had anything that compllicated where the phsycians were at their wits end.   So 2 stars for Dr Sobel, I would have given him more, but like I said, when you cannot respect my time I find it very hard to respect you. Maybe its his staff, maybe its a plethora of reasons but after 2 visits I had enough.
5 Been going to atlas since September I have seen great  results and recommend them to everyone who ask what I am doing. Very fast at courteous service very personable call you by name as soon as you walk in. Dr's are great and take as much time as needed and make sure you have question answered before they move on  Exited for them to hopefully start taking insurance.
4 I love this doctor's office. My family has been going to Dr. Kavlich for 15 years now. The nurses are great as well. They do everything here, so unless you really need a specialist, you won't be referred. The office hours are also great- night and weekend appointments! I drive here from Wickliffe because I have not found a better doctor. The only bad thing is all the random stuff for sale. Unless it is aromatherapy, I don't want to see candles for sale.
5 Seeing Dr. Gunn was a breath of fresh air. Having dealt with Fibromyalgia, among other painful conditions, I was not unfamiliar with the sometimes less than enthusiastic care I had received from doctors in the past. However, Dr. Gunn is an amazing find and he takes the time to listen and truly believes in finding and proceeding with care that works for me. In fact, I felt welcomed by the whole office from the time I walked through the front doors until I left. I really appreciated being treated like a human and not a number on a paper. Thanks again!
1 The first I had heard of True Harmony was by purchasing a massage voucher through Livingsocial.com.  It's near my home plus the offer was a good deal so I thought I would give it a try.    The receptionist was challenged in booking the appointment.  Oddly enough, they asked for my marital status during the booking process.  I cannot understand the relevance and the question just made the experience feel weird.    When I showed at my appointment time, I was told they had incorrectly booked me and it was for the following day.  I had moved my day around to be there and they had just expected me to come back the next day despite their error.  I was not offered an apology or even the slightest concern for my inconvenience.    I cancelled my purchase and I wont be returning.  I cannot afford to set aside time and not have that respected.
5 Dr Rosenstein is the BEST!! My doctor of 15 years died so i have been on the search for a new one. Dr Rosenstein actually listens to your concerns. He is very intelligent but doesn't act like hes smarter than everyone else lol.  I have severe back pain for about a year now and every doctor blew me off but not him. He did x-rays that same day in his office and ordered an MRI. He also had me do blood work in his office as well which was nice. Dr Rosenstein actually has a conversation with you as if you guys know eachother rather than treating u like just a number. For me it is important for a doctor to have a good bedside manner and Dr Rosenstein definitely has that! He also gave me my sleeping meds with refills so u dont have to come back every single month. He made me feel very comfortable and i feel fully confident that he will find a solution to my pain! He is literally one of the best doctors i have ever been to. I would give him more than 5 stars if i could.  The office staff is very friendly as well!
5 Everyone from the front desk to the nurse, LPN, and doctor were wonderful.   Got in an ATV accident during vacation and took an uber to see if it stitches were needed.  Once I filled out my new patient forms, I was called back within minutes.  Got my stitches and everyone was professional and gentle.  Highly recommend.
5 Alex Del Gado and his entire staff and very perceptive and interested in helping cure people so no surgery is needed! They are very attentive to every injury we have had and helped overcome the pain. The facility is bright and clean - a happy place to be for physical therapy!  We were happy with our choice of places to go for this exercise and feel their services are A++!
1 I'll keep this short.  Today for the 2nd time in a couple years the Doctor I was seeing just up and left.  Now, that's everyone's right and I appreciate that, however, what is ABSOLUTELY NOT right is the total lack of information this group overlooks.  Like a number of people, I am on medications and it is totally unprofessional to not inform patients that the primary care provider has left.  You find out when your meds keep getting disapproved at your pharmacy when you need them.  Of course now, you have to disrupt your personal life to immediately find a new doctor, set an appointment (which may be delayed a few days due to lack of apt times) perhaps take more tests so that the new Dr. is comfortable with approving your meds, etc.  The point is, a simple call to existing patients is not much to ask when a Dr. leaves/thrown out of a practice which allows an controlled transition instead of panic transition to a new Dr.  Bottom line - IMHO, do not choose these people as your primary care providers
1 The new Asian PA (physicans assistant) prescribed me vagina yeast cream for my foot and was super cold. She left the room before I could even ask about anything else (I had pain in my leg). I usually like coming here but time for a new MD (real doctor). I'm TIRED of PA's. Seriously? You can be sued for prescribing the wrong medicine. Other than that the office staff are really nice.  Update: so I went back to see the Dr. Allen MD, and he was way better. Nice, informative, and he knew what he was talking about. He even gave me a different diagnosis! The other PA said it was a ringworm infection when it was really eczema talk about dumb! But they still sent the wrong prescription to the pharmacy disappointed on that aspect. Now I have to sit here and wait for probably over an hour so that they can talk to the doctor and send a different prescription. The office staff over the phone since I was bothering them about this was very impatient and rude so I'm going to a different doctor from now on. sorry total care I gave you a second chance and you failed again.
2 I started going here about a year and a half ago as it was close to my work and accepted my insurance. But it seems like EVERY TIME I come here there is an issue. Yesterday was the final straw-- I will be looking for a new doctor's office.    I called yesterday morning to make an appointment with any doctor for abdomen pain. I was already not feeling great and left work early to go to this appointment. When I got to the office the front desk said they didn't have it in their computer system. The lady at the front desk admitted that they had probably made a mistake (I had confirmation) and forgot to save my appointment. This is the second time this has happened. There was a girl in the other line having the same issue except she made her appointment month ago. The lady stated that they couldn't get me in with anyone for 4 hours. Not happening. I ended up leaving and going to an Urgent Care.  I always have trouble getting prescriptions here. Usually the doctor's assistant's fault. One time it took over 3 months to get them to send my prescription to the mail in service. Ridiculous! Recently she said she sent a multiple month prescription only to find out she messed that up and only sent one month. Every visit requires multiple messages through the portal because they just can't get this stuff right.   My doctor was nice (although extremely busy-- she must only work a few days a week because it takes months to get an appointment) but again this office requires too much followup on my part. I will not be returning!
1 During my first visit, I thought Dr. Sparks was a godsend. She listened intently to all of my health issues and seemed genuinely concerned. She's excellent at hand-holding. I did think it was odd that she was absolutely convinced (based on absolutely no tests, lab results or any prior medical information) that all of my problems were based on my diet, and would (magically??) clear themselves up if I cut sugar, wheat and dairy from my diet, but I felt so awful I thought I'd give it a try.  She did, however, order blood work - a lot of blood work - for me, which was conveniently drawn in the office.   Before the followup visit, I received a frantic phone call from one of the office assistants, who spouted off a long list of vitamin supplements that she said the doctor requested I begin taking immediately - but she couldn't tell me why, exactly. That was alarming. For the follow up, Sparks was unavailable so I saw the PA who nonchalantly told me I was a prime candidate for a heart attack, but that I'd need more tests (some of which wouldn't be covered by my insurance) - oh, and that I could purchase all of those expensive supplements through their office. No thanks!  I was told to return in 6 weeks.   When I did, I saw Sparks again - who, despite having my records in front of her, seemed to have no recollection of me or my issues. Except that now she wasn't so much worried about my "supposed" heart problems or lab results. I told her that I'd been (mostly) following the diet and taking the supplements she prescribed, but that I still felt lousy. She actually got a bit indignant when I suggested that maybe something was going on with me that has been overlooked. She again held my hand and explained that I was probably taking low-quality supplements since I hadn't purchased them through her office, and that all of my ills would disappear if I'd only remove wheat from my diet. Then she ordered a couple more non-covered tests and sent me on my way.   Enough was enough! The woman never did anything medically related besides listen to my heartbeat. How could she possibly know whether there was anything legitimately wrong with me? Is she just following the latest trends with all of that gluten garbage? Ridiculous. If you want to be seen by a "real" doctor, go elsewhere.
5 I have been treated at SPORTS by various therapists over more than 15 years for injuries , post op care and myofascial issues and have always had a great experience . SPORTS has given me relief from pain and helped me recover from muscle  issues when NUMEROUS other physical therapy places and specialists have failed . From the front staff to the therapists to the faculty itself to the office managers this is a top notch business .  These folks are true healers and the patient is truly their only interest Your health is your wealth - trust SPORTS with it and no one else !
1 One star for the friendliness of staff.   This review is for physio treatments, which were not very helpful. Each visit was a 20 minute session. 5-10 minutes of mild adjusting and the rest was just speaking with the physiotherapist about exercises I could do at home.   Then they submitted invoices to my insurance company for 1 hour sessions. I caught it and told my insurance company what they were trying to do.   Overall did not have a good experience and they tried to significantly reduce funding for my injury that I need to get better. Really disappointed in that kind of dishonest behaviour.
5 I've been seeing Dr. Tafreshi for about 6 years now, literally choosing him because Fresh was in the middle of his name. (Yes, I'm that ridiculous!)   Dr. Tafreshi's office isn't the prettiest or the newest or the nicest, but it has this warm feel to it. His entire staff from Jennifer to Maria to Suehey have always been kind, compassionate, friendly, and funny.   Since Dr. Fresh is an internal medicine doctor, I can get my labs, ultrasound, x-ray, and some other services done all in one place and under one co-pay!   If you're looking for an amazing doctor and professional staff that truly cares, you're in good hands at Meadows Medical with Dr. Tafreshi!
4 I have used Rosedale's services for chiropractic, massage therapy and physical therapy. They have all been very good. I am a medical professional myself so was often sceptical about some health services offered and was constantly asking questions. They were always able to answer me with helpful advice and professional courtesy.   They do seem to advise you to use their other services and make it sound as though you need them. Be wise and discerning and know what you need and stick to it and you'll be fine. Eg. Chiropractor telling me I need physical therapy multiple times per week to strength very minor shoulder weakness/pain. All I needed was to start working out again and reduce overuse stress at work. Not really necessary to spend thousands of my employers insurance money for physical therapy.   That being said, they do have a comprehensive range of services and will often be able to recommend and accommodate many of your needs within their facility. Eg. Chiropractor was able to provide orthotics and recommend massage therapy which I needed and didn't realize!  Overall am pleased with the services and the practitioners are all excellent and professional.
1 BEWARE!!! This business NEVER/ANSWERS their phone. I bought a KGB deal but cannot use it because they never call back to schedule.  THEY ARE LITERALLY STEALING MONEY.
5 The staff members are nice and very accomendating to your schedule. The atmosphere is relaxing and laid back. I felt comfortable with Dr. Reiss from day one. He is attentive to what you tell him about any pain or discomfort that you may be having, and he cares about helping you get better. I would highly recommend him to anyone that is looking for a truly great Chiropractor.
1 Been coming to this office for a few years now... The front desk is absolutely TERRIBLE. On the phone I received a ridiculously amount of attitude when trying to schedule my appointment. The next day I needed a note for work and oddly enough got the same attitude and was told to come in and get one. Not only was the terrible attitude over the phone, but in person you receive the same rude and uncaring customer service.
2 I'm very disappointed with the front desk staff at this office. I've been coming here for years, and I'm currently looking for a new doctor because I just can't deal with the poor service anymore. I wasted a whole trip on a work day, I wasn't even able to see my doctor due to the front office staffs poor communication. I really like my doctor, she's amazing! I've never had any issues with her, or her assistant. But billing, the appointment setters and the receptionist are rude, unapologetic, and incompetent. I hope to find a new doctors office soon :). The only reason I'm even giving 2 stars is because my doctor is so good.
5 I have been going to Clinic 24 since they opened and I am very happy with the service provided.  They have had some staff changes as well as some operations equipment changes so there have been a few hiccups with reminders in general, but it's all been straightened out now.  I always get a friendly greeting when I arrive, my calls are always returned in between appointments, and I've referred people here that have been able to get in right away.   My mother was in from out of town and they were able to take her in the walk in clinic very quickly. I'm usually in my appointment within 15 minutes of arriving unless something crazy has come up (and that does happen once in a while). The office manager does care and works very hard to try to take care of any issues as they arise. I would definitely recommend.
5 Since day 1, the OSR team has been the biggest asset in my recovery. They have me constantly improving and I've only seen progress with them.   The nicest therapy staff and office in Scottsdale, plus very knowledgable about the entire body.   Couldn't recommend a better physical therapy location.
1 Stay away from Dana Forte.  She is a joke. Not worth waiting for and she should be investigated for harassment and poor patient care.  Dr Hailstone was smart to get out of there. You can find him at Southern Nevada Internal Medicine and Pediatrics 6252 S Rainbow Blvd Ste 110 Las Vegas, NV 89118 (702) 253-5410
5 I love this clinic. I have been going once a week and I always leave feeling refreshed and relaxed. Jeffrey D. is clearly passionate for his field and provides amazing service.
5 I've been a patient of Dr. Phillips for about 5 years now.  I'm 70 years old and have had many doctors, since my career in my working days included frequent relocations.  I've probably had more than two dozen primary care physicians.  Dr. Phillips is one of the very best.  The main reason I say this is that he gives you all the time that you need, he listens well, he digs deeper to determine what would be the best approach to any problems and collaborates with you on the treatment approach.  He is empathetic and dedicated.  The patient always gets all the time required.  Dr. Phillips treated effectively several chronic problems I have dealt with for years with other doctors.  I am healthier due in part to his dedication.  This rare virtue does sometimes have a negative "downstream" effect, which is that in not acting like a factory production line, occasionally the result is schedule slippage - one has to spend a little time looking at one's wristwatch and reading magazines in the waiting room.  Reminds me of a sign I saw in a family diner once: "Fast food isn't good.  Good food isn't fast.  Thank you for your patience."
5 Dr. Adams seems very friendly and took the time to explain my condition thoroughly. Went in with a numb leg came out feelings much better. Overall very impressed with my experience.
5 I've been going to Totum for about 3 years now and I love it! The value for the classes outweigh the higher cost per month. I love the midday yoga, pilates and boxing classes the most as they're scheduled at a good time. The friday yoga yin is the best, it always leaves body and mind in a peaceful state at the end of the week.  The personal trainers and instructors are very professional and got me to a level I didn't think possible, and I'm far more aware of my body's little kinks, something that would have been ignored completely at other gyms. The cleanliness of the gym and friendliness of the staff (as well as other patrons) lends to a very welcoming and positive environment.  The other great thing about Totum is the wealth of staff available for other aspects related to wellness. I've used their physio, chiro, massage and acupuncture services so far with great results. I may do more!
5 My son Julian woke up the day after Christmas with a really bad ear infection we call to his doctor's office and couldn't get him in till following day.. We live around the corner from this new urgent care so we said let's give it a try.. we are so happy we did.. my son forgot for a few moments about his ear infection while playing on the eye play on the floor which I thought was a wonderful idea because I hate toys at a doctor's office they always seem so full of germs to me.. the staff in the office was wonderful and the lady at the front desk was super super nice she really seemed genuinely concerned about my son pain. Dr. Hank was wonderful took his time to get to know us address all of my concerns he had wonderful bedside manners made my son feel very comfortable. They will be my first choice again for my children and myself I have told all the parents at my sons school what a wonderfull place and how friendly the wellness staff are great job guys welcome to vegas ! You guys are a breath of fresh air.. Urgent cares in las vegas are horrible Im glad we found you !  Kelly L.
5 Grant Chiropractic has made a tremendous impact in restoring my health.  From the personal stretching to the decompression tables, deep muscle stimulators and dry needling (acupuncture) I have made a recovery back to being healthy and having a major improvement in the quality of my life.  In addition they have a full time Dr. of Physical Therapy, Dr. Sells who has been very thoughtful and in evaluating and working my case.  Thanks again to both of you and all your staff including Dr. Mroczek.
3 Dr Norton is good but too busy... Making an OBGYN apt for just the fact its your annual is hard and going and sitting in a paper vest with a paper blanket draped over you for over an HOUR waiting for your check up is just wrong... I have no down there issues.. I should be IN and OUT!!  Back again to get an IUD placed... My last visit was super fast for consult ... So I'm updating my review!
1 I called 3 weeks ago to see if they were seeing new patients and was told the office manager would review our information and let us know with a phone call. I was told it would take a few days. I called today since I hadn't heard anything for 3 weeks, and when I called the girl on the phone said she couldn't find any info on us. When I called before I had to give them all of my personal information and insurance info. When she couldn't find any record of us it made me worry and I asked to speak to the office manager.... Wow, I believe all the bad reviews on her!!! She acted as if she couldn't care a less about me and acted like I was wasting her time. I let her know what happened and she said "We are not accepting new patients because we are having roof work done". That was the whole explanation. I said "wow, that's it. No phone call or anything"? Her reply was "I'm sorry if you didn't get the message". I said what message? No one called my phone and there was no message left. She again said sorry you didn't get your message, putting the blame on me. I asked what happened to all the information that was taken and she said it was in the form of an email to her and she deleted it. I said... wait a minute, you got an email from me and deleted it but didn't call me and let me know you were not seeing new patients. She again said sorry you feel that way and hung up on me.  Not the best customer service, especially coming from an office manager. I will let Tri-City Cardiology know how I was treated and inform them that they should not refer patients there anymore!   The office manager needs to be fired. She has no customer service skills!!!
2 I really wanted to like this practice. Dr. Milne himself is actually very like-able! However he is rather expensive and I'm sure his 'remedy' has brought on more problems that I now have to see a specialist. Firstly he sent me for bloodwork but wanted to charge a lot more to interpret the bloodwork...first visit was already expensive. Second, he didnt respond to an e-mail I sent before going on vacation as I had some ongoing concerns. And finally after giving me a colon cleanse and Livertone caps I have experienced chronic diarrhea now for 2 months which I'm sure his treatments brought on. I'm sure he's great for some people, however I've been left worse off health wise.
1 This place is a joke. If you like waiting at least 15 minutes before you get called back then this a great place. I had an appointment just to get a refill on my prescription. I waiting for an hour and 35 minutes. AN HOUR AND 35 minutes!! I saw DR Cheng. Apparently she was behind. It was only 10:00 am. If you are behind that long you shouldn't be in practice. That wasn't even the the end of it. I finally get called back and they ask for a urine sample and some forms filled out. This wasn't my first time there. STUPID!! I told them multiple times that I had my mom waiting at the airport and I was in a hurry. You want to dare ask me to fill out forms when I've been here before and after you made me wait now going on hour and 45 minutes!! Dr. Cheng was rude. I normally see Dr. Smith. I will never go back to this place ever again!! Even to see a different doctor. It's not worth it. I'm always waiting in the lobby for a long period of time before I even get called back. Then your waiting again in the room. Also the receptionist will sit there while your in line and will not acknowledge you. Not a "just a minute I'll be right with you" nothing!! Like your not even there. This office is only 6 minutes away from my house so that was a plus. I'm willing to drive a lot further than to ever step foot in this office again!! I wish so badly I can give 0 stars. But apparently yelp won't allow that.
5 I've been going to Traci for around 7 years now, and for good reason... she has an incredible intuition for how to find and treat the source of deep muscular pain. As an avid mountain biker I've regularly had pain and and injuries over the years and Traci is always the 2nd person I see, after the doctor.  Not only is she a magician at helping the pain go away, but she is also an amazing person.
1 Waste of time and money. I had an appointment with Dr Thompson and I show up and they tell me I will see Dr LaSalle. I said, no, I have an appointment with Dr Thompson. They said oh, she's not here, she's on vacation, Dr LaSalle is really nice, she's an MD, not a Naturopathic. But I can reschedule if I want. Why ?? I left work early to be here on time. Now you want me to do it again, as you did not have the courtesy to call and ask me if this was OK.   So I stay and assume she will read my file before she walks in. NO, not a chance. I had to reiterate everything we had done. All she suggested was more blood work in 3 months. That's all they do here, is take blood, and see you for 2 minutes and tell you to have more blood work in another 3 months. I assumed the three prior times blood work was done would be sufficient. They repeat the same blood work every 3 months. And never suggest repair and address the issues.   Only go here if you want people to be rude and dis-interested in you. Hell, all you are is a co-pay. Have fun, I've moved on. Chalk this up to a bad experience.
5 I highly recommend Vitality medical. Cristy and the staff are absolutely wonderful.  I have been going here since 2010 and feel like family every time I am there.  Thank you for the wonderful service.
2 Mom is leaving on Friday after having been here for her allowed 20 days.  Most days the care is minimal but must give a big shout out to Raymond who is by far and away, the BEST nurse on staff.  Very caring, patient and helpful when not many people there are.  Stacy is always kind as is Lynn, Tara, Bonnie & Lilyana.  Maggie always seems to be put out if you ask her anything at all.  After 12 days of no changes of her bedding, Raymond jumped into action as he was leaving after a normal 12 hour shift.  I knew he was tired but never winced when I asked if he could change the sheets.  Five stars for him on every level of care and attention! Very upset that I had brought my Mom 2 small inexpensive items...a nail file and a fidget wheel and they both disappeared.  Whoever worked the day shift on 6-25-17 & 6-27-17 should be looked at closely.  Very troubling that someone on the staff feels the need to steal these incidental items that meant alot to my Mom to have there.  Also, you better never need help going to the bathroom but if you are lucky enough to get someone to take you there before wetting the bed, good luck in getting anyone to come and help you back to bed.  My Mom weighs all of 94 lbs so it's not like it was too much to ask someone to assist her.   The office staff is nice if you can get someone on the phone.  Forget it if you leave a message for someone to call you back though.  It's pointless.   Felt that the food was good
1 This is a hot mess of unorganization, non responsive, rude operation. You will NOT be seen by a physician, only FNPs. They go through FNPs like crazy.  I went there for a couple of years and was on my third FNP. Each time I saw a new FNP it was like starting over; history, questions, new blood tests... The last time I had an appt. I went to their lab a week early for a blood test so that the results would be ready for my appt. 7 days later.  The rude receptionist, Marlene, said that I couldn't take the blood test without meeting with the new FNP first.  Don't bother calling them for anything, you won't get a call back.  The place is dark, dreary and not very clean. STAY AWAY FROM THIS DUMP...
3 I asked for a iron pill when im taking it since ever and the doctor just wrote one pack for me i usually get it everywhere un limited but they didn't prescribed it for me
1 Worse Doctors office in the world...  Each time we go in there office your your greeted by rude staff, more interested in talking personal things about what they did the night before vs talking care of there customers.   We have never seen a Doctor in all the times we have gone.  This practice uses PA and nursing students.   This way Dr Doug and his Father the make more money paying less in employee salary!   You cant go in to this office with out be being high pressured to have extra testing done like blood work, cancer screening etc, again to add to more billable claims.  We went in to have paper work signed and the refused, until we made an appointment, pressured us again for blood work etc..  They are scamming insurance company's left and right!  Do yourself and family a favor and find another practice...
4 Gov't hospital. You get what you pay.
1 They refer me to a specialist bc my results were abnormal. They can't get their fax machine to send the results to the specialist after I asked them to do so 3 times. They're recommending for me to deliver the results myself. I can't believe they can't send a fax. I've been there twice, both times they're delayed in attending. They made me wait in the waiting room then again in the room to see a doctor. So inefficient.
4 The gym itself is wonderful. The architecture is phenomenal. Devices work very well with very high probability, and there are enough that one can find a working one. Staff are mostly really nice and helpful, and their spinning classes are really good. Their running classes are great as well. Their hours on the weekend can definitely be improved; 5pm is just ridiculous. My only problem with them was that they renewed my subscription automatically without letting me know, and locked me into paying even though I was going to be out of town.
4 I became a patient of Ensign Family Medicine after relocating to Las Vegas 2+ years ago. At that time, it was close to where my condo was and I simply called to make an appointment and submitted my paperwork via email. I love the convenience of submitting my medical forms ahead of time since it helps speed up the new patient enrollment process. I'm still coming to this office and have been very pleased with their service.   PA Max Smith has been my primary health care provider at this establishment. He has taken very good care of myself and my fiancé. From the flu to regular office visits,  PA Smith has been great! He has excellent bedside manner and makes you feel comfortable during your medical exam. He is very welcoming, friendly, and knowledgeable. I have never felt rushed through my appointment. He always takes his time to ensure I have adequate face time and that all of my questions are answered.    Bonus: They offer morning appointments for those early birds!  My appointment today was early-- 7:15 am. I checked in and was escorted to the exam room in under 10 minutes. I wrapped up my appointment in under 30 minutes and made it to work within the hour. I have been here before and experienced a long wait (only once-- out of the handful of times I've visited). However, I think this is common in other medical establishments. I think it helps making appointments first thing in the morning. I'm busy and this works for me. I like to check things off my list first thing.
5 I loved the cranialsacral massage I got!  The environment was very healing and peaceful and I felt so much better when I left.  I am very much looking forward to my next visit.  I felt welcomed, respected, and very much taken care of!
5 It's difficult to be impartial since I have been a patient of Dr. Novelly for over 20 years.  Staying loyal to one dentist over all these years only means one thing.   He is great. This is a pain free Denistry. I am always felt welcome when I visit and the staff are very friendly. One of the best qualities is honesty. Before any procedure you are told what to expect and offered options to make your decision easier. If your looking for a honest, caring , knowledgable dentist, this is the place.  I would be remiss if I didn't mention Lygia  my dental hygienist. Some one else I spent time over the years getting my cleanings.
1 I am putting a 1 star and I'm being generous with this.. Please do not spend your money here go to a real doctor. Thank god I was covered by inssurance or else this would have been the biggest waste of money and time.  I have seen other Osteopaths in the past but this was a joke. It's not even worth the effort to explain what happened. Save your money and go to the hospital.
1 Long line and front desk staffs treat long line as a joke.  You got to me kidding me.  Do you think I want to sit in line for 3 hours with sick kid when you joke around about patient demanding service to see a doctor?
5 I had an amazing first time float! Vianca knew it was my first time floating ever, so she took her time explaining everything to me and made sure she left no question unanswered.   The float itself was amazing! I chose to float with no lights and no sound, but they do have options for music, and you can use your own phone with an AUX cord connected to the float pod. The water was warm and amazing and the shower was only 2 steps away. It was very comforting knowing I had my own private space.   Chris and Vianca were so welcoming and I will definitely be coming back!
1 Dear Ann Marie, Thank you for your comment; however, you never tried to call us. I had to call back three days later and spoke to another supervisor about our situation. I was basically told the same thing with no resolution. The supervisor even apologized to me for not returning my call. She said she was, ironically, out sick.
4 Leena Patel is an amazing teacher. I tried her class once in her home studio. The class was $20 for drop in. There were other students in class.   I do love her style in teaching and she was very good, but the price for me was too expensive and the practice wasn't too vigorous and challenging enough for me. However, the other students were regular practitioners with Leena due to back injuries, so I understand why that class was not as advanced as I am use to.  I wouldn't mind going back to Leena but will probably take a private class so I can focus on an advanced level of practice.
1 I am usually not one to leave bad reviews but my experience with this office was so poor, I felt inclined to do so. I was looking for a new Dr. and called to make my annual Well Woman's exam with Dr. Mansfield. The receptionist informed me that before I was able to make the actual exam appointment, I needed to schedule an initial/consultation visit, and that they could schedule the exam afterwards. I agreed and came in for the initial visit.   The visit was fine and the Dr. inquired if there were any medical issues going on that I specifically wanted to address. I shared a few things with her that I wanted to be sure were addressed in the next visit. She sent me away with some blood work orders and told me that we would discuss the lab work and complete the exam when I came back in.   I got busy and wasn't able to make it in for the blood work or the exam, and in the meantime, received a bill in the mail for $150! My insurance covers the cost completely of any annual Well Woman's visit so I was very surprised by the expensive bill. I called the billing office to inquire. They informed me that it was coded as a sick visit but said they were confused because in the notes, it indicated I called for a Well Woman's visit. They said because I expressed "concerns" in the initial visit (which the doctor specifically inquired about), that the doctor coded it as a sick visit instead. Mind you, no exam/tests of any sort were conducted, I literally went in for the appointment because I was told I had to as part of the Well Woman's exam process.   Long story short, I ended up having to call a total of 5 times (no exaggeration) to follow up and see if the doctor would re-code the bill accurately. The first 4 calls to the billing office, I was told they would talk to the Dr. and get back to me, which never happened. Ultimately, the Dr. refused to re-code the bill because no exam occurred (which, if you're picking up what I'm putting down, literally could not have occurred under their current policy of initial visit before exam). On top of that, after finally receiving that answer and agreeing to pay the sick visit cost, they told me they had sent it to collections!!! (which was also ultimately incorrect). Either way, I feel like this office scams you for your money and the communication was horrible. Beware!
5 Dr. Tarnick is seriously awesome! He has made a huge difference in my neck and shoulder after a serious car accident. I've been making progress everyday visiting Dr. Tarnick. Can't be thankful enough.
5 My mom stayed about a week at Sante of Chandler after a major surgery and was impressed. The staff made her feel well cared for, and the rooms were clean and comfortable.
5 Amazing. I spent 2 years hopping between a chiropractor and another orthopedist. Finally, I found this place and I have never been more relieved.  Dr. Burbank listened to me and genuinely cared that I am a 34 year old with excruciating pain in my right hip. Today, I had my first injection into my hip joint.   It finally feels like I am making progress in a non-intrusive way.   Thank you OrthoCarolina. From the bottom of my heart.
5 I have had L4 and L5 problems all of my life, completely debilitating at times.  Over those years I have tried spinal decompression, chiropractic medicine, cortisone shots and even contemplated surgery.  I am very grateful and thankful to have been referred to Jesse at Exos. I had 3 months of intense physical therapy under jesse's care and have never felt better.  The facility is amazing and more importantly, the staff is extremely knowledgeable and dedicated to their patients.
1 I called to make an appt, but was greeted with a message to leave your name & number & we will get back to you in 2 business days. That should've clued me in. I called again the following week, nobody got back to me. When I went on the Internet, it turns out they closed abruptly nov 8, it says some patients were informed of the closing, I sure was not informed. Unprofessional.
5 What everyone else has already said. I too used Yelp to pick this doctor and Yelp was not wrong. Quick, Painless, Easy, and the Dr Listened to everything I had to say, and was not rushed. Excellent value for the money.
5 I've been coming to see Dr Mall and his team for a long time.  He is by far the best doctor I've ever seen.  He really cares about mu well being.  I never leave his office feeling rushed or like I have more questions.  He always takes his time answering questions and making me feel confident.  His staff has always treated me like an actual person, not like a number or something to knock ff a to-do list.   I love the Myers cocktails.  Its quick.  Its painless and I feel great for weeks after.  One time My co-worker and I started coming down with the flu.  I got a Myers the next day and my flu was about an entire week shorter than hers.  I highly recommend it to anyone.  It's definitely worth it.
5 Whitney did a wonderful job working with me on both of my shoulder issues she is personable and was so professional. Great atmosphere KC
5 Dr. Gabrielle Goodrick helped me tremendously along with her staff. Especially once nurse I forget her name but she was an Asian woman who first majored in anthropology before becoming a nurse and she showed me such immense kindness and just genuine decency. Through the past week I experienced one of the most devastating situations I've ever had to experience and these people made all of this, just a little bit easier. They couldn't change what I was going through, but they made me comfortable, I felt fully informed,  they showed me understanding, and they did not judge me. That is everything and more you could ever get from a doctor's office.
5 Being a runner and avid work-out fan makes it hard when you have injuries, so when I got a strained muscle from running I didn't want to see a conventional doctor and cortisone was not an option.  Dr Pete with Apex Chiropractic is in my networking group so I called him and made an appt.  Having never been to the chiro before naturally I was super nervous, but Dr Pete is very informative and professional and outlined what we would be doing over the course of a few weeks to help get me back to running again, pain free! He has also a suberb staff of massage therapists on hand to help with the healing process.  I would highly encourage anyone looking for chiropractic care to consider Dr Pete Sutton and his staff!
5 Today i saw Dr. Darzev for a second time. I am impresed haw she does it. To be profetional and very personal at the same time. Answering all my questions and telling me the plan and why I have to do this labs. The staff is ver nice and helpfull.
4 I've been going to EVFM for a few years now. I dislike the long waits in the waiting room but it's always so easy to get an appointment. Today I saw PA Kristina Kirchqessner for the first time and I really liked her. She's very nice, so professional, she took her time and answered all my questions. I highly recommend scheduling with her.
5 Best experience since moving to the area!Saw the reviews and thought I would share my experience. I recently moved and was in need of A doctor due to severe ear pain. I called and got an appointment that day. The lady on the phone even told me how much my co- pay would be. Got there and had 1 short form to fill out and was called back to the exam room before I finished filling it out. The doctor and nurse were very nice and personable. Hands down great experience, nurse has since called to see how I am doing.
5 I have been a patient with Page for 6 years now. They have gone through a lot of growing pains over the years. However, I'm happy to say this place has been remodeled and the service is A LOT better. If you believe in second chances I would give this place one more shot. Also, they take appointments until 7-ish. Not many Dr.'s offices offer that. 5 stars for sure!
1 First, the staff was awesome, and I have been going to My Dr Now for almost a year. When I called for an appointment I was told my primary care physician was no longer there so i made an appointment with a different provider. I  needed a refill on prescriptions I have been on for over 3 yrs.  They are  pain medications,  and I  know that can be concerning, but I  also know that Dr M. Jones could have looked me up on the pharmacy board and seem I wasn't Dr shopping and I wasn't asking for my prescriptions early. If My Dr Now advertises as family practice they should behave like one. Dr Jones didn't bother to ask why I take those medications,  examine me,  or ask any history.  I felt horrible when i left, like I had done something wrong. He was very short and pointed out My Dr Now policy on chronic pain.  He should know as a Doctor that withdrawing from narcotics is very unpleasant, and having chronic pain is hard enough without being labeled a drug seeker.  Again the staff was great, and all my other experiences  there have been good.
1 I went to this place as of feb 2016. Since then I keep getting payment reminder from CPL. I called them at least 5 times since then and they always assure me that it's going to be taken care of. Now that I get a new notice again and I came here and asked for paperworks so I can maybe submit to cpl labs directly. I find out that they only sent the fax to CPL only as of April 2017. 14 months, Seriously!!  I never regretted being to any doctors office before. Poor poor management. There is an elder lady right now who is having issue finding her paper. There is 1 and 3 but no 2. What a Joke!  Avoid!! Negligent and Irresponsible Staff!!!
5 Always loved this gym. Very military friendly. Even when it's a little crowded it still has a great flow. Svonte that works there is a great help! Had my first problem while using the equipment in the 3 years I've been a member  (I caused the issue), Svonte came right over and solved it immediately.
5 Magenta Health is a really efficient and high-tech office. You book your appointments online and sign-in at the front desk via tablets. All patient resources can also be found online, which is helpful. And, bonus, the most I've ever waited for an appointment is 15 minutes (which is pretty impressive for a clinic).   Doctors are busy people, and so even though appointments can be quick, I feel like Dr. Che has always been personable and understanding. She really listens to your concerns and you feel like you're in good hands.   Highly recommended!
5 I came in with beyond mid back pain and couldn't locate a decent Chiropractor and I remembered coming here years ago and Dr. Hansen aligned my back back up.        This time around I have to say I 100% and above would highly suggest and recommend all to go to him and personally experience the professionalism the staff and Doctor gives to his patients.        When I came in I filled out some basic paperwork and questionnaire then within literally 5 minutes or less of being done filling out the paperwork, I was brought back and had my blood pressure taken and had some basic questions asked of me answered. The insane part is they have this electrode machine as I call the electric shock wave lol or taser taser taser, but it's not a taser, it sent shock waves over my back and tickled my sides and belly. I felt pain, but I asked for the high intense mode cause I was told it would be better for my back, but if I couldn't take the pain they could lower it, I said no lol.        Once the machine was done with my back the doctor came in and remembered me from years back and I told him what I did and from there he realigned my back to where it should be. I swear by this, because I walked in in major pain and walked out feeling way way way less pain in my back and felt almost as good as new. I still feel slight pain, but again this was in a days visit, so I believe one or two more visits I'll be good to go and just come maybe every few months cause my profession causes these problems sometimes.       The office staff are very professional and respectful, the doctor himself is honestly very professional and answers all questions and concerns. Love this place I am glad they never left or went out of business.        A quick side note, it's truly obvious why this place never will in my opinion go out of business and that stems from how they treat you and care. I've seen many businesses go out of business due to lack of customer service and respect for the client.
5 Doctor Charlie is simple wonderful, very thorough, professional and caring.  I've lived in Vegas my entire life, locating a great physician with a great team/staff in this valley is no an easy task;  Dr. Charlie is second to none.
5 I appreciate the friendly atmosphere while recovering from a cracked kneecap. Dr. Dave and all staff give personal attention, encouragement and instruction. A variety of techniques are employed to rebuild and recover mobility and muscle mass lost.
1 I wish I could give her 0 stars. I was a patient for almost four years and the last year was the worst. Everyone except Megan at the front desk is rude and inconsiderate. Dr Harter doesn't listen and apparently is related to the office manager so you can't complain about anyone there without being hung up on or having your prescriptions held hostage. The only good medical assistant, Thomas, is no longer there probably because he was too nice. They charged me to sign a form for my insurance and everyday until I picked it up the price was raised. I fired her and it was the best feeling ever. I transferred everything to another doctor and they saved my life. Yes, they missed something and I could potentially sue them but I am not that kind of person. I would rather just move on. She may claim to be the ONLY migraine doctor in Arizona, that is wonderful. But if you know your body, don't go there. SHE WON'T LISTEN TO YOU. SHE THINKS SHE IS THE EXPERT. YOU KNOW YOUR BODY BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE.
4 Seems like an adequate place to go when your kid doesn't believe the Mom diagnosis of "youarenotfreakingdyingyoujusthaveacoldlikehalfofthekidsinschoolwithyou."  Registration was quick and painless, I verified my information and the initial symptoms that brought us to the clinic.    The waiting room is fairly small, but was ample for the amount of people waiting.  I was able to find a chair away from people wearing yellow masks and The antibacterial hand gel was placed in a convenient location even though I didn't touch anything other than my own phone.  Perks: a tv you can hear.  Free wifi to make waiting the anticipated half an hour wait (was actually 25 minutes but felt like an hour) bearable.  There are magazines and coloring pages if you are out there and brave unlike me.    The visit was unremarkable.  The providers were just pleasant enough, nothing amazing, but nothing terrible.  I've had to take my kids to my fair share of urgent care centers in fourteen years and I consider this one pretty competitive.  Bonus was the fact my kid was at least sick and the provider was up to par on the school note regulations, so while she couldn't do the classwork my kid missed, at least we have a medical note for a legitimate illness as attendance guidelines can get fierce especially when it's the second week of school and one has already been sent home ill.
5 A very friendly practice with a team of highly competent doctors and nurses. My husband and I are lucky to have found such a high level of care. Mrs Edwards
3 Both my son & I were patients; the actual therapists were very knowledgeable & had great ability to explain the issue & what the plan to heal is, but the techs seemed more concerned about folding towels than paying attention to telling patients the next thing to do, since there were usually so many things to do or activities would change. Spent just as much time standing around waiting as actually doing the therapy.  Very rarely offered heat, stem, or ice at the end of each session - at least compared to other facilities visited over the years. The woman who sat at the front desk was very "sharp" in her tone & had no empathy for any issues (scheduling, school note, payment arrangements, insurance issues are a few examples), although the office manager was very polite when I had to speak with her.
5 I see some bad reviews from a long time ago. I'm fairly new to the clinic (about one year) and I have to disagree. Perhaps they now have new staff. Dr. K and his PA (cant remember her name) are very knowledgeable, spend time making sure I understand everything and am comfortable. I would recommend this office for your healthcare WITHOUT ANY RESERVATION.
5 Dr. Patel is a great doctor, and very informative. Best doctor I've ever had, no crazy wait times either. I strongly recommend checking him out if you are looking for a doctor.
5 I have been a patient of Dr. Myers at the Palmer Center for Natural Healing for about 6 months now. Dr. Myers and her entire staff do an OUTSTANDING job as they truly do care about their patients! On top of this, they do a wonderful work when it comes to diagnosing and treating severe back pain. Every step of the healing process was thoroughly explained and then accurately and successfully treated- Naturally!   Dr.Alicia Myers is wonderful to work with! Being a bigger guy, I was concerned whether or not she would be able to adjust me properly?! I must tell you, she's done a better than ANY other Chiropractor I have visited. She does a GREAT job of explaining her game plan in getting you back to health. Furthermore, you can tell that she truly does care about the well being of everybody that walks thru her door!  I have, and will continue, to HIGHLY recommend her to anybody experiencing back/body pain.  The Palmer Center for Natural Healing was also able to put together an affordable treatment package, which I was thankful for.  All and all- I would highly recommend Dr. Myers and the Palmer Center for Natural Healing to anyone else who is looking to alleviate back pain in a Naturopathic way.
4 Had a great experience rehabbing from a car accident injury.....Paul and David (the PT Team at Scottsdale) took great care of me and helped me get back in working order in only 6 weeks.  The equipment was top notch at the gym, amenities were nice, and location was very close to home.
5 Dr. Bui has been my doctor for many years, and he is the best most caring doctor I've ever had. He gives you time, TLC, and remembers details, but he has been very accurate in his diagnosis and very concerned about the treatment details.
1 BEWARE: So my husband scheduled an appointment to take care of a few issues. The day before his appointment, my husband broke his leg and had to have surgery so we rescheduled the appointment. We went in the Monday after his surgery and were told we would receive 15 minutes with the doctor and that they will only address 2 issues per visit (The sign says: Multiple issues require multiple appointments; 2 issues per visit only). SCAM ALERT! That is a great way to take advantage of the insurance companies and the clients by making them pay for additional visits when it should be addressed in a single one.   Secondly, he had three (3) appointments scheduled for 3:00 pm. We waited over an hour before we walked out. Its not like all the problems my husband had would have been addressed anyways because of the two issue limit.   HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE and we found a new provider to say the least.
1 I have had the worst experience with this Physician office and their staff. I have called on many different occassions on questions for my doctor or help and I was passed on to Dr. LeMasters "assistant" I left messages on her voicemail and my calls are NEVER returned. I am extremely upset with the lack of service I have recieved from this office and their staff. I work in a Medical Practice and go above and beyond for our patients and expect the same when it comes to my healthcare. I will be looking else where for a physician office that is reliable and I can trust in helping me with my healthcare needs. This office does not focus on patients needs and will be a complete upset. I do not recommend this office to anyone.
4 You might wait in the lobby for longer than you want to but when you get in to see the Doctor (Dr. Barry) you will be glad you waited. She is going to take as much time as you need to talk not only about what you are there for but anything else you want duing the visit. She is the deffinition of patient CARE. I am glad to have found her. The office staff are all professional friendly people and I dont have much trouble getting in when I need to. Great job.
5 I love pepper tree, my Doctor, Dr. Lewis is the best Doctor ever. He talks to me like a person. He's loving and caring. He know my whole family and treats my family. It took me 10 yrs to find him. And I'm so happy I did. Dr. Lewis is awesome and dr. Shweekie  is awsome too. 95 present of the doctors at pepper tree are so awesome. And there nurses are great too. A nurse named Kay. That I see a lot to get my INR checked. She is one hell of a nurse.  Caring, loving her a dr. Lewis . Listen and truly care.
5 Anytime I am in Las Vegas, I make it a point to book a massage with Laura, even though I routinely get massages back in California.  She is very professional, punctual and knowledgeable.  Her energy is incredible to be around - very healing, and caring.  She hears what your problems are, finds any that you any that you kind of gotten used to and forgot, and then takes care of them all!   It's no wonder I always feel exceptionally better at the end of a session.  I want to take her home with me :)
5 I went to see Katherine Looby the the Gilbert office today and was really impressed with her. I had been wondering what my issue was and she was really clear and concise and explained what treatment I needed, what PT I would need, possible further work and was really sympathetic and professional. I wish all Dr's were like her and came away wishing she was my PCP.
1 I have had to go to Dr. Darzev's office 4 times a year for observations. Each time I go to her office, the nurses and receptionists are very kind and considerate, but I wait for 30-40 minutes to see her, which wouldn't be a big deal if she didn't treat me like a burden when I am there. She asks me to come in every six months for blood work and tests, and then I have to go in for another appointment for my results. EVERY TIME I meet with her she asks me why I'm there. She never explains why she wants to do so many tests on me, and when I ask her questions she is very condescending. She makes me feel stupid for asking me questions, and replies very impatiently. She talks a lot to her assistant or nurse about me, while I am sitting in front of her. It makes me feel self-conscious, and it's unprofessional. I am nervous going to the Doctor to begin with. My gynecologist (completely different doctor) treats me so well, and I feel like she genuinely wants to help me, so I am shocked every time I go to see Dr. Darzev. She treats me like I'm just a number, not a person. Sometimes she will just leave, and I have no idea that my appointment is over. I have to walk out and ask the receptionist if they need anything else from me. I understand she is probably busy, but is it that hard to say "good-bye, have a nice day?" or even treat me like a human being.
5 I recently was in need of a new doctor and Magenta Health was recommended by a naturopath. I was paired with Dr. Andrew Chou. Through my experience,  I have found that magenta health runs with excellent precision. Their online booking system is excellent as is their  in office administration. Everything operates with fluidity. Dr . Chou is punctual, friendly and helpful. He always returns emails in a timely manner. I would highly recommend Magenta health to anyone looking for a top class clinic.
1 This is my review from a past experience that I'm adding to Yelp since it is not reflected here...  If I could give them 0 stars, I would.  For starters, the physical therapists are terrible.  I ultimately had to go back to my doctor, who referred me to another doctor, who put me back in PT - a real Physical Therapist this time.  The real PT (not VibrantCare) was awesome.  Let's get into it:  First day of PT, before I even start my session, one of the Physical Therapists is literally yelling (he was from New York) at another therapist.  They got into a screaming match about having too many patients and not enough therapists.  I should've left that moment when he said "we need to start canceling appointments, this is not therapy" (he was right).  Anyways.  After listening to their yelling match I was evaluated by an idiot.  The guy clearly didn't know what he was doing.  Anyways, he evaluates me and gives me a piece of paper with neck stretches to do at home.  I ask "Is that it?"  his response: "what do you mean?"  My response: "These stretches only will do the trick?  I don't need any sort of manual therapy, massage therapy, adjustments, or coming into the therapy?"  him: "oh yeah... come here 3 times  a week for 4 weeks"... Idiot.  That first 4 weeks was ridiculous.  So the new yorker therapist was my therapist - I never saw the evaluator after day 1.  They fired the new yorker after week 1 for his antics on my day 1.  After they fired him, I never saw the same therapist more than once.  So I had to go over everything from start to finish with each therapist each time.  Needless to say, the shottyness of their therapy was not healing me.  There was very very very little progress, but since there was some progress, my doctor extended my sessions another 6 weeks.  10 weeks total.  After 10 weeks, my doc said "look, you should've been healed - I'm going to refer you to a spine specialist".  The spine specialist referred me to a different doctor, who referred me to another Physical Therapy place.  Within a couple weeks of manual therapy, massage therapy, and real exercises that strengthened my core and my back, I was healed... Unlike the stupid neck stretches that VibrantCare had me do.  Here's the kicker... after VibrantCare racked up all these bills and billed my medical insurance, they sent me a bill.  I tried calling a lady named Lisa, who is, according to their messaging system, the accounting rep for Arizona.  I left 4 voicemails with Lisa.  No call back.  Needless to say, after a few months of invoices, and me calling them and leaving voicemails, they send me to collections.  I called again and asked to speak to Lisa's Supervisor... "Lisa who? who is Lisa?"  These people are amazingly idiotic.  Apparently Lisa doesn't exist.  So I deal with a lady named Miriam.  I explain the bad service, arguments between therapists, shotty treatments, and how I had to go elsewhere to get healed, etc... to which she said "well you still were treated so you owe the bill"  I said "no, I wasn't treated... the new place treated me and healed me... you guys simply billed my insurance for nonsense".  Ultimately, I paid the bill after she confirmed everything I said and still said "yes, everything you said was validated, but you still owe the bill".  So I told her "ok, I'll pay the bill, but I'm going to leave negative feedback" to which she threatened legal action if I left negative reviews.  I said "Ok, have your lawyer contact me then, because I as a consumer can leave any negative feedback about your terrible service"  There's more to tell, but I'm tired of typing.  *sigh* *deep breath*  So... needless to say, These guys suck!
5 The whole feel of the place is one of knowledge and empowerment while healing. Every one is helpful and really good at their job. I have been going there for 8 months to work on my achilles tendon. I have also transitioned to their personal trainer, Rich, who has been able to help me get my strength back while understanding and working within my limitations. I highly recommend this facility to any one who needs either physical therapy or a personal trainer.
1 Absolutely the WORST medical care!! Don't go there!! the people who work there are idiots. An ortho provider faxed them a document nd needed it signed by an M.D. only.  I needed the document faxed back to an ortho provider and they kept telling me they didn't receive it. then they finally faxed it back, but it was signed by a nurse practitioner, NOT and MD. then again they faxed it back to the ortho, the MD signed it, but didn't print his name!! They were also supposed to send my medical records to the ortho and never did that either. I am waiting for diabetic shoes since December 1. Its December 22 and still the shoes haven't been ordered because of the idiots working in my doctor now in Laveen.  I've never heard of a medical provider where you cannot call them directly. When you call them you get a useless call center someplace. you have to insist that the person that answers in the call center connect you with the clinic. The person in the call center will ask you stupid questions instead of just connecting you wasting your time. There are no MD's in this place, they've all bolted because of the incompetence of the people working there. There are only Nurse practitioners and they don't seem to be monitored by any MD. This place will just frustrate you, and make you angry. Find a qualified place for your medical needs.
4 Great medical practice.  I have thyroid issues and need to see this doctor on a regular basis.  Here is some great items I like: 1. Calls to confirm apointments a week in advance. 2. They answer the phone. 3. They can look up my info and email me.   4. Professional group of individuals that work here.   I don't know about you, but my past experience is that it is hard to get prescriptions at my regular doctor filled, or someone on the phone.  Glad these guys stepped it up and seem to be on the ball.  Keep up the great work!
2 Clean studio.  However- Yoga Nazis.  Regimented. Most of the good teachers have left. Check out summits or inner vision to find hot classes with teachers who encourage you to listen to your body and not push it..this is not a fun atmosphere for yoga. No more injuries after switching to teachers and studios who encourage modifying and gentle nurturing corrections.
1 This place is a total waste of time every time you come in they find another reason to come up with some ridiculous new bill. Nothing but a bunch of money grubbers.
1 OMG this is one of the wort experiences I have ever had in my life.  The woman that they have at the front desk is one of the most miserable persons I have ever had the displeasure to have to deal with.  Extremely rude and very unfriendly and not helpful at all!  I am amazed that she still works there after I and many other patients have complained about her.  If you are sick and need to be seen quickly forget it.  You will be told to go to the emergency room or urgent care.  They take almost zero effort helping you with medical insurance.  They have put almost all of the medical insurance responsibility on you the patient.  They have always treated their Phlebotomist's in the office horribly.  They are not as helpful treating men as they are with women.  One of the Doctors in the office always has a frown on her face.  Never a hello or any type of positive greeting.  Initially I had a lot of confidence being treated by Dr. Schweda but that confidence eroded the longer she was my Doctor.  The other Doctor in the office treats Dr. Schweda as if she is better than her almost as if Dr Schweda was her child.  Your income seems to be a very significant factor in being treated that in my opinion is a large part of the reason they moved their office to where it is located now.  Beware!
1 Dont waste your time (literally). Ive had the same problem as it seems almost all the people who have written reviews have. The wait on the phone and in office is ridiculous. Waited on the phone for 20 mins. Hung up called back she then asked again if she could put me on hold i said "no thank you" she did it anyway. So i hung up and called again and this time they finally helped me. So annoying! I also now have to wait days for my prescription as they never sent it like they were supposed to and now have to wait 48 for it to get authorized... seriously?! In office same thing a long wait time!
1 Day hardly even touched me.   Doesn't have any curiosity about your condition.   He put his little electric device on my back for a while. It did nothing at all.   I went twice in case my first visit was out the ordinary. It was not.   Now I'm again looking for a decent chiropractor.
1 I have been to this office 2 times and each time has been a joke. Most recent visit I went in with a UTI and severe back pain. Your visit primarily revolves around a medical student who asks you questions. Dr. Kerr eventually comes in hands you papers and walks out. Not only do you never actually get seen by the dr for an exam but she is rude and does not seem to care about her patients. I have multiple allergies to medications and had relayed that information to the student. I'm handed a prescription for sulfa which I am highly allergic to. My next concern are the medications safe for breastfeeding. I got a rude answer of you can stop breastfeeding or not take the antibiotics. That's not only unprofessional but rude. No one took the time to do a physical examination or even look at my back. Appointments are impossible to get here they are either closed or booked full though their clinic always seems relatively empty when I've gone.  This primary care dr is a joke. If you want to be seen and not just shoved to a room asked a few questions and then rushed out the door. Go elsewhere. Not only do I not recommend this dr to anyone I will not be going to her office again.
2 I was there from out of town visiting and has to take my son to the Children's Hospital ER. Medically they got the job done BUT the whole place was so dirty and dingy and worn down. From the second I got out of the car in the parking garage I could tell this place was very neglected.   We were seen by a resident who was very thorough and kind. BUT she sat on the trash can to talk to us, that's just gross and unprofessional!
1 Did a full evaluation and a few rehab visits all went well but my insurance would not cover the rehab so I could not afford the expense. My back goes out every once and a while so I just need somewhere I can get an adjustment when needed. Last week I called to get that adjustment. The front desk told me it had been some time since I have been seen so I could not get an adjustment until I did a full evaluation again. How ridiculous is that! Obvious this place cares more about the money than the patient. Well, they just lost another patient.
5 I have been really impressed with Dr Jeffrey and the staff. They have been really helpful for my aches and pains and keeping me "In line"
1 Is there a lower rating, because the 1 is really generous! Clueless staff, long waiting time and no return calls.   That is in a nutshell how I would describe this unprofessional office!
5 One of my family members has been in Desert Canyon several times, following surgeries, etc. Great care from kind and caring professional.  The gym is outstanding, and the entire setting of the facility is designed to look as non-clinical as possible, with spacious private rooms, and patios and an atrium, as well as a large stone fireplace in the entrance.
5 I have been to MANY chiropractors and by far Turley is the best.   My friend referred me after spending months in PT and after just a few sessions I was feeling about 60% better.  I've been going for a few wks, twice per week and by far I'm on my way to 100%.  Now I'm down to once per week and what I love is that he isn't the type of chiro who suggests going forever.  He is realistic and cares about his patients.
1 I found her receptionist to be the friendliest part of my visit.  Dr Bradley and her assistant were not friendly at all!  Dr Bradley spent my visit critiquing my past Dr.'s... who specialized in my orthopedic need!   I thought only orthopedic dr's thought highly of themselves...
5 A truly high class massage for a bargain price.  I have been seeing Irina for close to 2 years at her private practice.  Irina, truly creates a wonderful ambiance with her soft music, very comfortable heated massage table, expensive oils and her use of hot towels.  She also provides a wonderful hot stone massage. I could just as easily be getting a massage at a five star hotel.  The massage is never rushed, and even one the rare occasion when I would show up late, Irina would always treat me for at least an hour.  She impresses me in that she actually cares about her clients and will discuss and treat your ailments.  Ms Marukhnyak always will provide amazing stretches for you to do on your own.  She is an excellent listener and  the massage time flies by.  I have even received excellent advice on skin  products for the wrinkles on my face and my rough feet.  Irina has an esthetician degree also I believe.
1 This has to be the most frustrating experience I've had with doctor's office. Receptionists are rude and incompetent. When you have to take time off, get to your appointment only to realize that everything the receptionist said to me during the scheduling over the phone is false. I made sure to ask her twice if they take my form of payment which she reassured me they did and even laughed it off only to tell me in person otherwise and look at me with a blank face. If those are only receptionists, I can only imagine what's going on behind those doors. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, save yourself sometime and frustration
4 Kate is a wonderful massage therapist! She is thorough and knows how to work the sore spots...especially my shoulders! I would highly recommend Kate!
5 I typically hate going to the doctors no matter what the situation. This place is quick and painless and would recommend to anyone. Very kind staff!
1 This is by far the WORST clinic I have ever been to. The receptionist staff are exceptionally rude, there are 3 that work there, and each one have provided me with the most unpleasant interaction I've ever had in the medical environment. The physicians there are fine, but due to the hostility of the front desk I am changing family physicians. Save yourself a horrible experience and try to find another physician in the area, trust me, it is not worth it. I tried to give them a shot for a few months, but consistently I felt verbally abused.
5 If you are looking for a doctor that truly cares, takes their time, and really works hard to figure out any issue that you have, I highly recommend Dr. Rosenstein.  My daughter has been in and out of the hospital and without diagnosis.   Dr. Rosenstein was one of the only doctors to show any empathy and concern regarding her dilapidated health. He is one doctor that truly cares. He did not get a message before the end of the work day that my daughter was out of pain meds and he went completely out of his way to assure that she would be safe and comfortable over the weekend. This is just one example how this doctor has gone over and beyond and truly shows that he cares for his patients.  He is diligently working to review all of her records so we can find out what is wrong with her.   A+++
1 Horrible Experience.  I ordered an item and requested next day delivered.  Called the company to make sure they got my order and I was getting it the next day.  (What I ordered I needed in a rush for a bed ridden family member).  Well, when I called the company, I was told that the charge I paid for overnight was not correct.  On top of the amount their website quotes for overnight, the manufacturer also charges an additional $129.  So after disputing this, we came to an agreement to deliver it in 3 days.  On the second day I called to make sure that item was shipped and guess what, NOT SHIPPED.  So I would not be receiving it as promised.  I was told I would have to wait until the following week and they were not sure when the manufacturer would ship it out.  So bottom line it would take the normal 7 to 10 days to be delivered if I was lucky.  Of course this was not acceptable so I decided to cancel my order because I really needed this item ASAP. ( I ordered it from WAYFAIR excellent service.)  In addition, I asked Active Forever to sent back the payment to the third party company called Affirm, which I used to pay for this Item.  I was told in 2 days it should all be cleared and I would get a notice telling me my account had been cleared.  Well I called Affirm 2 days later and nothing was sent to them that I had canceled my order.  Now is a week and 2 days later and I called Affirm again and nothing has been sent.  So I called Active Forever and I was told that they submitted the paperwork and their waiting on Affirm to respond.  As you and I know that means they probably sent it today.  It is really endless.    The only good experience about this whole situation was speaking with Greg.  He really tried with all his superiors to help me get the item on time, but unfortunately his company and the manufacturer are very irresponsible.  Greg should be working with a more reliable and respectable company.  Not a company who cannot deliver what they promise.    Thank God for this bad experience because I found WAYFAIR, Who actually delivered and I got the item at a lower cost.  They have great customer service.  I highly recommend them.
5 I've been practicing here on-and-off since Jan 2014 (Note: I live in both Arizona and California, so I typically don't practice during summers and long holiday breaks). When in California, I have tried to look for a Bikram Yoga studio. Sadly, when you practice in Tempe, all other places pale in comparison.   There's a lot to love at BYT. The staff and instructors are friendly, the facilities are clean, they offer a TON of classes, and are open seven days a week. Given my living situation, BYT has been incredible with being flexible with my membership. Elaina has always been accommodating, and I really appreciate that. While not all instructors are built the same, I will say that the few that I haven't been too keen on are no longer there.   The practice room is huge and for the most part, there's plenty of space. (Okay... I usually go to the early morning classes. I'm sure the night ones are crowded.) I love that the room is clean and doesn't smell like Satan's cheesy toes (Yeah BY Daly City. I'm talkin' to YOU!). The instructors are really good at making sure that the room has been aired out between classes, and that the room isn't too stuffy. The neofloor that they use should be standard issue in ALL BY studios. Plus, the air system is great.  Admittedly, I do have minor complaints. However, they have to do with fellow students more than they have to do with the facility, staff, and instructors. To my fellow practitioners, here are some tips you should be mindful of....  1) Be respectful when setting up your space. The room is huge, so please look at the mirror and make sure you're not blocking anyone's view. This is challenging when the classes are crowded, but please do your best. (You do not want to be that a$$hole on weekend mornings who always ALWAYS sets his mat up directly in front of people - even when there are only two other people in the room. Um, just cuz you're in the front row doesn't mean you can disregard the newbies in the back row. I curse you, Mr. Selfish. I.CURSE.YOU.)  2) When setting up your mat, the blue line should hit the MIDDLE of your mat. Misplacing your mat (e.g. making it so that the blue line hits the top or bottom of your mat) throws off the entire space. This is a HUGE deal when the room gets crowded because you're basically hogging up three to four spaces, making it hard for people to set-up. The staff at BYT are really good at going over etiquette, so please follow it. Personally, I really don't need your smelly feet in my face, just because you don't know where your mat is supposed to go. It would be great if the instructors could do a simple check or reminder at the beginning of class. Then again, if everyone was given the same set of rules, that you decide to misplace your mat just tells me you're a crappy listener... and a crappy person. If this is you, again, I.CURSE.YOU.  3) For as clean as the room is, things will get a little funky - especially if you don't wear proper deodorant. Don't be a tool. Come to class clean. There are showers and towels for rent if you need to do a simple rinse off. Your senses (and mine) will be grateful.  4) It's hot yoga. There's lots of sweating going on. If you're a heavy sweater, please bring extra towels. While using your mat and towel as sweat-filled slip-n-slide is cute to you, it's not to me. Note: I DO NOT appreciate you flicking your sweat on me. That's just rude. Yes, if this is you, I.CURSE.YOU.  5) You should bring water. If you practice regularly, I recommend investing in a HydroFlask or insulated Kleen Kanteen.   6) If you're a super newbie, I highly recommend that you sit out for the first set, and then pick up the pose in the second set. You're welcome.  7) When students come in late, I do wish instructors led the late kids to the open spaces (usually toward the front). While it's sometimes hard to avoid, I suggest NOT setting up directly in front of the door. It makes it difficult for people to maneuver in and out. (Plus, do you really want to be the person that everyone has to walk/trip over just to leave after the final pose?)  8) In the locker rooms, please don't drag your wet feet and hair all over the place. It's just rude. Wipe your feet, for heaven's sake.   Er. Um. Okay. I think I've covered it. In sum, this is an AMAZING place. If you're a student, keep it that way and be kind to your fellow practitioner. Thanks:)
5 My father was at Heartland of Willoughby for Physical Therapy due to a Fall. Great service and employees! Each day I was visiting my father, the STNA's were friendly and supportive. Nurses were very compassionate and informative of my fathers med's. I would definitely bring another relative here for any service they offer.
5 I don't know Frank M. (above) but we sound like clones. After 3 back surgeries, plenty of pain, and no golf for 5 years, I discovered Pilates. Thanks to AZ Body Mechanics, Dr. Aaron, and especially the fantastic Lesley Evans, I am back on the golf course (at 83 years old) and feeling better than I ever imagined would be possible again. It is a wonderful facility filled with nice people. If you are moping around do yourself a favor and give them a try.
3 So the front office ladie that's around her 60-70's is a rude and grumpy ladie! No reason to be so rude. First impression sucked bad. I almost walked out. Just because you hate your job or life doesn't give you right to be a shit head to me!!!! I got to my appointment at 858 and I was supposed to be there at 9. I waited till 932. Bummer! I should have made it at 930! After that the two other women I dealt with were nice. They had a smile on there face and seemed to be really positive. The nurse practitioner was awesome and actually cared and listen and is trying to figure me out. Ill probably be back. But just ignore the grumpy old women in the front.
4 Dr. Adams is attentive and really listens. She take pride in her work and is an all around attentive doctor. She is up to date on the latest treatments. She is a great doctor. The only reason I didn't give her 5 stars is the really long wait each time I visit, and the inexperienced and uncaring staff at the front. They clearly don't enjoy their job, which reflects in the treatment of patients.   Dr. Adams is great and I will continue to see her despite the staff and waiting time.
5 My friend recommended Foothills Sports Medicine Physical Therapy after an injury I sustained. I called a couple of places and Foothill Bell Rd was very prompt and accommodating to help me setup my first appointment. I am very pleased with the therapy, the location, and the staff. Everyone here is so friendly and helpful. Rich, Steve, Betsy and everyone else have been outstanding. I am writing this review in various places because I did not find many reviews for PT places when I was deciding where to go. If you choose this place, I hope your experience is great as well. Take care!
5 Been coming here for years and they have never disappointed me. No appointment needed I just show up anytime and they get me in right away. I have never been treated better anywhere else. Thanks for the years of great service.
5 Everyone was friendly and professional.  I appreciate that they are proficient in both conventional and holistic medicine, and that they focus on preventative measures.
1 If I could give a zero star review I would.I went to Dr Tice on the recommendation of a neighbor, whose description of what he did for her mirrored the positive reviews I have read here.  This was not my experience.my first impression of his office and staff was not good, however I chalked it up to the fact that he had just moved to open his own practice, growing pains. He seemed kind and professional, and ordered blood work, telling me his standard blood panels were much more in depth than other Drs, which sounded good to me. My first red flag was his constant reference to my weight, yes I am overweight, but I was there for bio identical hormone replacement not weight loss, which I felt I had to reiterate multiple times, to which his reply was it all ties together, fair enough. When I returned for my follow up to go over the very thorough blood work he had ordered ,I was very impressed ,they tested for things I didn't know you could do blood tests for! In the end most of the things he tested for had absolutely nothing to do with the issues I went to see him for,he prescribed me appetite suppressants, and pharmaceutical hormones, cholesterol meds, and injections at his office that I was told were also hormones. None of it was bio identical, which was the only reason I came to see him in the first place! None of it was anything I couldn't have gotten from my regular ob, and we all know there is no magic bullit for weight loss, calorie reduction and movement, period. When I researched  the results of my blood work and the medications he prescribed I decided the benefits of some did not out weigh the risks, also based on the extremely incompetent office staff decided he was not the doc for me. At this point I would have chalked it up to not a good Dr/patient relationship fit,and left if at that, no review necessary. Then I received the bill from my insurance company, of which he is a covered provider, my grand total of non covered, unauthorized, therefore not covered, blood work which included genetic testing(which was NEVER disclosed or discussed until after it was done) has come in at approximately $9,800. So, close to 10 grand for a prescription for Zocor, progesterone, thyroid(which was completely unnecessary) and appetite suppressants. Of those medications, based on my own research and a second opinion, I ended up with the Zocor, and a food plan with a registered dietician, and some over the counter supplements from GNC.I have lost 10 lbs, , after doing more research and my own personal family history risk factors, decided to hold off on hormone replacement,and seem to be going much better( change in diet and exercise I'm sure)aside from all the work of trying to get the outrageous cost of some of this blood work reduced or covered by my insurance after the fact,and the out of network labs he sent it to. If you are looking for a doc, and this guy seems up your alley, I say go with God, but buyer beware, you better check once twice and three times before you agree to the blood work, you will be in for a very nasty surprise when you receive that bill three months down the road,also I would say get a second opinion before you start ingesting or injecting possibly unnecessary medications in your body, and yes hormones are medications.
4 I have been to a few places in Charlotte to find a massage place and I embarked on Zen Massage.  I was a bit apprehensive at first because the establishment is a home turned massage business.  None-the-less I was very impressed with the feel and ambiance that would make me want to go back.  My therapist was great and had a nice technique, she knew what she was doing.  The only thing that bothered me was the location of the establishment.  While i was there I heard cars, motorcycles and firetrucks, which was disturbing but that was my only criticism.
4 This is a very new wellness clinic that opened about 3 weeks ago.  They are currently offering a complimentary service for first-time customers with a massage therapist, chiropractor or physiotherapist, which is a great way to generate new clients. I chose the 30-minute RMT service and made an appointment on the same day.  There is parking in the front and back of the building. I was a bit confused at first about where to enter, but found it fairly quickly. The clinic is on the second floor, so when you enter the building, you have to walk up a set of somewhat bouncy stairs. Watch your step so you don't trip! The clinic is small but welcoming and clean. The receptionist provides you with a set of forms to complete but this is standard with any clinic. The director was also there and she was very friendly and accommodating, considering that I didn't realize that I had not confirmed my appointment earlier that day. Oops!  The massage itself was very relaxing and comfortable. RMT Brandon was very professional and completed a brief, yet thorough, assessment. I believe they currently have two RMTs and both are male (for those who are interested in knowing).  I left the clinic with no strings attached, and did not feel any obligation to make a future appointment (of course they did ask if I wanted to book another appointment as part of good customer service).   I had a really good experience at this clinic and I will definitely make an appointment to return for a follow-up massage appointment (1-hour this time)!
5 Eric, Tami, and their team are amazing. I have had knee pain for about 6 years now, did numerous x-rays and MRI's and never could find anything wrong with it. I was on numerous anti-inflammatory meds and pain meds as I am on my feet all day at work. My trainer recommended that I see Eric and he was a life-savior.   Thanks to Dr Eric and his team, I am OFF of all meds, and no longer have any pain. I can not stress how much they helped me. Now the team is helping me with carpal tunnel. I have referred a couple people to them and will continue to do so!   The team is very knowledgeable and I enjoy that they explain to you about what they are doing and how it will help you. They are very hands on and they have a wide variety of techniques so it never feels like they are just always doing the same thing over and over.   The receptionists are amazing and friendly as well! They work with you on your schedule and even send text messages and calls to check in on you to see how you are doing.
1 I hear Doctors are pretty good but the office operations are lacking in customer service at best. Everything is made difficult and time consuming.  Can't speak to a live person. It's a series of leaving messages and waiting for return calls. Issue is if something goes wrong in process or there's a misunderstanding a lot of time is wasted.  Kylie is rood and doesn't listen.  Was considering this office I am no longer interested. Customer service is very important to me!
1 Dr. David Wikler is one of the rudest Dr's I have ever met!! Getting very upset when a 94 year old woman was 5 minutes late for an appointment....like a Dr. is NEVER late....When he was told about other issues, other than what was scheduled, he said that "this visit was supposed to be only for the issue that you made the appointment for, not all these extras"......what the heck is a Dr. for??   When I tried to explain the reason for being late 5 minutes, he said that I should have left the house earlier......AND the girl at the front desk, asked "WHY ARE YOU LATE"....over and over again.....badgering me like I was an imbecile....For god's sake, I was bringing my 94 year old mother in and she had to go to the bathroom...... Is this the way that a Dr. should be treating his patients??  I don't think so......  So beware!!!!!  He has ZERO bedside manor....  He has no respect for the patient!!!!  He needs to get some schooling on compassion......  BEWARE....BEWARE....BEWARE......!!!!!!!   I will be reporting him and his practice to the Medical Board!!!!
3 The staff was very friendly and the office seemed very clean. However, I would not come here again for any serious issues. The doctor didn't really seem to listen to what I was telling him. He kept asking me for information I had already just told him! He also asked me for information that I had already filled out on the patient form. I guess he didn't read it which was a bit weird. Overall, I would only return here if I had a bad cold, or needed refills, something minor. These offices seem to be a franchise, which didn't leave me with a great feeling.
5 I have been going to Dr. Khani for years. She is very personable, takes the time to evaluate you as a whole person, and helps you self-advocate by giving you extensive information about choices you can make for your health. I have never met a Doctor like her, and I always reccommend her to anyone. When I need to see her for a sick visit she is always accommodating.
1 Horrible. Never have they answered my phonecalls or returned my calls. Failed to send out prescriptions multiple times. Staff is rude and lacks empathy. Doctor is a joke.
5 I've been going here for about almost a year now and all the staff and medical team do a very great job at taking care of my needs. They get straight to the point and I'm never left waiting for a long period of time. Also has very friendly nurses, I feel very comfortable going here. Andrea is very helpful and informative and I would recommend anyone to see her.
4 Nice, clean, friendly place.  No frills- just massage.  People are a little talkative- both my friend and I had therapists who talked throughout the massage, but we're talkative people and it seems likely they just went along with it.  I had a girl named Marisol.  I think.  She did a great job but I was so out of it when I left I forgot to get her card- all I can tell you is she has really pretty eyes and decently strong hands.  good pressure, worked with my requests, and generally the kind of sympathetic person you want rubbing your shoulders- if I lived nearby, I'd definitely go back to her.    They clearly see a large volume of customers, so being on time is a big deal.  Price is good, but not amazing.  Music is pretty generic- I'm really starting to hate the perpetual adoration of Enya.    I would return here.  I'd ask for the same girl.  That seems worth 4 stars to me.
5 Dr. Chris has been a tremendous asset in my road to living a pain free life.  His flexible scheduling and his friendly demeanor is also big plus.  My wife and son went to see him after their car accident and he was extremely instrumental in assisting with their recovery.  I would highly recommend him to all my friends and family.
2 When you call - you get voicemail 75 percent of the time.  And then they don't return your calls when you leave a message.
1 I thought I'd give this place another try, but If you're looking for a primary physician i would look into an actual doctors office, not something that runs like an urgent care clinic. I've been here 3 times and each time I've wait over 45 minutes PAST my appointment time to be called back. Once you get called back and have the MA see you, you wait another 20+ minutes to see your doctor. My last visit had two people in the waiting room get up to leave because they took so long. Another irritating thing, i came in to get blood work done, paid the $30 copay and was told they couldn't do it becauSe i didn't fast for 8 hours. That is fine, my fault. I was told to come back the next day, which i did, and they still charged me another $30 copay. Don't waste your time here.
5 This is the best medical care center ever. I was in severe pain and they treated me so well and with so much compassion and kindness doing everything to help me feel better. This place is literally everything I always wished a doctor's office would be and I can't recommend it highly enough. My husband and I are extremely impressed and will make this our new primary care.
1 This place has had blue tarps and sandbags on their roof for months.  Have some pride. Really tired of looking at it!
5 Looking for a fancy high end spa to be pampered? You might want to go elsewhere. However, if you're looking for good results with attentive masseuses who can pin point your pain areas and make you feel like a million bucks... You should go to Toronto Bodyworks.  I used to be a regular here but after my favourite RMT moved out of the city and I stopped working downtown, I admittedly have only been back a couple times. But everyone that treated me was able to provide the deep tissue bodywork that I require, so even though I'm not a regular anymore, I want to give a 5 star shout out to Toronto Bodyworks for curing what ailed me at those times.
2 I've been coming here on and off for over 5 years.  Medical staff is fine, but the office staff is horrid.  Referrals take 1-2 months to process, after you come in to the office requesting them a 3rd and 4th time...this has happened to my self and husband... today, the front person forgot to check me in, after waiting an hour and a half...I will try their Scottsdale location for one last shot...
5 In one word incredible. First time coming to a cryotherapy facility. Must say I was very impressed. The facility itself is beautiful with a friendly attentive staff that is there to serve you. And the owner Angelo is very knowledgeable and walks you through the entire process from beginning to end. They offer many other treatments as well. I got down to -290 degrees Fahrenheit. If you've never done it definitely come in talk with Angelo and he will set you up. Highly recommended.
5 I just started coming in to this office cause my primary practitioner Dr. Anthony Sommer moved to this location. Every time I come in I get in right away, everyone is very polite and pleasant. This location is closer to my house making it very convenient for me. I've been his patient for over 20 years. I totally trust Dr. Sommer, his very meticulous  and will take care of you like no other doctor.
5 1:45  I called Turntable asking if I could see someone about my sore throat. 2:00  I walked down to the clinic and was offered tea while I waited. 2:06  My health coach (Andrew) brought me into a visitation room, asked me questions about my throat, and took my vitals. 2:23  My physician (Dr. Neil) came in, took a look at my throat, did a few tests including an instant test for Strep Throat (negative), talked me through was was going on, wrote a prescription, gave me tips to reduce my throat swelling, and answered all my questions 2:47  I walked out of Turntable. 2:55  I'm in my bed drinking plenty of fluids.  I consider myself a fairly healthy person and I still visit Turntable a few times a month for things like Yoga, Strength Training, and sessions with a social worker. It's also nice to know that when I'm legitimately sick Turntable has my back.
5 I came here after my accident and am very pleased with the whole process. From the front desk being paperless to signing in on the tablets. My recovery was very smooth making sure I got all the necessary referrals and staying on top of them. I'm so glad to have felt welcomed and cared for. Especially the front, they know you by name and always acknowledge you coming in an out! The nurses do an amazing job and the doctors are phenomenal. I would recommend this place to anyone injured. They work around your schedule. Thank you !
5 I've been going to Global Chiropractic for about 5 months now and absolutely love it. I went in for some pain and numbness in my arm and within a couple weeks the pain had gone away. After reviewing my x-rays, Dr. Steven informed me that this was due to many years of degradation and it was going to take some time to fix. I've been so impressed with the level of service here that I now take my children to see him  My daughter (who's currently 5) loves going to get adjusted and feels better and stands up straighter after our visits. She doesn't complain about aches and pains any more either.  My 2 year old son is very active and loves jumping off beds/couches/whatever whenever he can. This must be putting a strain on his spine and the main reason I felt it necessary to take him to see Dr. Steven as well. Although he can't talk, I feel that he too enjoys going as he runs to the door whenever we get there.  All in all, if you are looking for a chiropractor and you are anywhere in the valley, take the trek to see Dr. Steven @ Global Chiropractic. The reviews all over the net and on all the walls in his office are testaments to his work.
5 I was referred to this facility by my ortho doctor and really couldn't be more pleased.  Doug Meyrose and his staff are knowledgeable, most helpful and (all) very, very nice.  They helped me to see results  quickly and did not insist that I continue as I had progressed so well. Doug and I both felt that I needed no further visits so there was no "pushing" for additional charges. Happy to write this review and refer anyone who need physical therapy to Doug and his crew.
5 I make appointments here once a week and it's something that I always truly look forward to every week! Great office, incredible staff--every therapist really knows what they're doing and they also make an effort to make you feel comfortable. The staff here are just fun and easy to talk to, this  location has quickly become another home to me. Dr. Lucas is awesome and so easy to get along with as well. He really knows how to get the job done! I always walk out of here feeling my best.
5 This facility is amazing!! Trusting someone when you are in pain can be  hard to do at times but if you are in pain then this is the place for you. I would recommed this place to anyone of my friends or loved ones. You wont regret going to the center! Everyone is amazing and they have a great front office staff! Parking can be tight at times but if thats the only complaint I'd say they are most def a 5 star!!! Thank you CAP PT
1 Common courtesy...if it's going to take over an hour and a half to be seen when you schedule an appointment, you should be told and given the chance to reschedule. The excuse is that there's "new patients" but they know that when they schedule. Disrespectful and thoughtless. Hope the doctor is better than his service.
1 Sooooo disappointing!!!! Every time I have to come here the wait gets ridiculously longer with an appointment!! I will be finding a different place to take my son to because complaining does not make there system change. They don't seem to care that your time is being wasted.
5 One word. Seamless. This is the best healthcare I've ever received from a medical team. If you identify as Trans, GNC, or SGL, this is the physician you want to go to. Doesn't matter if you're an adult or teen. Dr. Rob has excellent bedside manner and tons of resources to help with your ongoing care. The front desk staff is also top notch. You can just tell that everyone here is on the same page. They're here for you as the patient. I can't recommend this place enough!
5 Best dentist ever, Dave is a great dentist that takes the time to explain procedures... I drive to chandler from gilbert just to get the care he gives and it's worth it every time
1 Don't use this place for your Doctor. I didn't do my research, and unfortunately found exactly what many on here say. They overcharge for everything. They signed me up for an at-home sleep apnea test through Reno Sleep Services that charged over $750 for a test. A simple Google search shows you can get the same test done for $250-$500.  Do your research and find another place to go to.
2 I started going to Hatfield after I was diagnosed having clots in my leg and lungs. For the most part, they have been pretty spot on. When you're actually there, they're usually pretty friendly and quick to get you seated. However, the 2 starts is because twice now, due to lack of communication on their part, I am have to go without much needed medication. Neither of which are the types you're suppose to just suddenly STOP taking. The first was because the meds could not be refilled again without an appointment. NO ONE from the office bothered to even let me know this. You know, maybe when I got the initial prescription or when the pharmacy called to get the auto-refill authorization? It took the advice of my actual pharmacist and many phone calls later to finally be allowed to be seen and have my meds refilled. The second time, which is as of today, when I was given the prescription I was told to call back when I am almost out so that the provider could write out a new script, and for me to come pick it up. Called yesterday at 10am and left a message with the staff to give to said provider. It is now the next day, still no prescription, I am out of my meds, and the provider is out. I asked if I could come in and see another provider, and was told no, that only the original provider can prescribe. Now, I'm not a needy person, but when someone is out of their meds, you'd think rather than just telling the patient, "no sorry you're out of luck," you'd actually TRY to help find a solution. The only reason I didn't give 1 star is because when you're actually there, they're nice and caring. But any other time, they act like you're call is bothering them, and how dare you ask them to personally give the message to the provider. I've worked in the dental field, and there were several occasions I went to bat for the patient to the provider. It's just plain courteous and respectful. But maybe I'm just weird.
1 This place is a joke.  First, they know what our insurance is but then sent out x-ray tech and lab tech that they chose that were out of our network.  Thus, our insurance carrier denied all charges.  Second, the nurse practitioner who came to the house wasn't really well-versed despite many years of alleged experience.  She was reading things on her pad that my wife had already found on the Internet.  Third, she charged for a full doctor's visit on one of the visits even though the practitioner's rate is supposed to be lower.  Fourth, she decided to alter the medication she was prescribing but did not bother to tell me.  Fifth, she did not allow for any refills, even for the ones that she knew were going to be preventive or long term.  This leads to the sixth one, where they charge you $25 to review prescriptions and approve or deny them.  Finally, phone calls were not promptly returned and the practitioner and the office blamed each other.  The only redeeming item was that they at least made house calls.
1 My mother seemed to have good experiences with Dr. Raia. So I decided to give him a go. Once he found out that I Had Fibromyalsia, he used that as a go to for an excuse of surgery not working. Anyway, I had surgery on my hand. My hand still continued to hurt. I go back there for my post op examination. He comes in, does not really even look at me! Says hi, and leaves! That was basically the extent of the examination. My mother was with me. He didn't even ask her how she was, considering he did several different surgeries on her...  So I then ask for my medical records. I am DENIED. I am told by the office staff that too many mistakes are done, and so now, medical records are handled by a third party... And this third party CHARGES!  A few months later, my hand STILL hurts. I go to another doctor who runs tests. X-Rays showed bone spurs in my hand. My new doctor sends me for an MRI. I have fluid in my hand, swelling, unstable joint in BOTH hands, and my issue I went to Raia for, IS STILL THERE! Question, what on earth did Raia actually do? So now, just 8 months after my surgery, I am now preparing to go in for more surgery with my new doctor. Fibromyalsia Dr. Raia? Nope. Stop making excuses!
2 The only reason why I'm giving them 2 stars and not zero is because the nurse in the ER was nice.  I went there for a simple UTI, i was pretty much the only patient there, yet it took them over 2 hours to test my urine for bacteria while i got to sit there in pain waiting.  After all of that, i got charged $2000.  For a simple UTI, really?!  They didnt even give me antibiotics and pain relievers to hold me off til I got my prescriptions.  On top of that, i had a flareup 2 days later so i went to a clinic by me and the doc there told me i was given the wrong antibiotics so i was given new ones by the clinic.  Guess what?  It gets even better.  I kept calling st lukes to see when they were going to send me my bill so that i could pay it off and when they finally did, it said "final notice" so i paid it instantly online.  The next day i get a phone call from them saying i didnt pay them.  Really?!  I had them check their records and they found that i did in fact pay it.  Dont waste your time with this place, youre better off with a clinic or even urgent care.
4 I am totally not sure why people complain. EOS is super cheap with upgraded equipment. I have been going to this gym forever (even though you'd never be able to tell) and I really enjoy it.   From time to time they implement crazy policies, but they seem to vanish rather quickly. They have a really great selection of classes, a cinema, tons of equipment, an indoor pool and etc. I wish they had an indoor track, but maybe one day. I heard they were doing some sort on renovations.  I will say that they don't have the friendliest staff. Not everyone, but for example, the Group Exercise Manager - Rude! There is a pretty high turnover and eventually all the rude people disappear. Overall though, it's pretty good.
5 Years ago I was hit by a car while on a motorcycle waiting for a light (thanks, lady...not!), and I was thrown completely over her car landing on my right hip on the concrete.  Well, that accident finally caught up with me, and I had to have a total hip replacement on that side as my hip had calcified/broken to the point I had no ball and hip socket making it almost impossible to walk. I chose Sante--a short term stay rehab facility--on reviews of facilities from health organizations (not Yelp.com).  So, so soon as I had my operation and short 2.5 days in the hospital I was transferred to Sante for a 2 week stay. To my delight, I got excellent care at Sante I thought.  You come out of that type of rough operation practically helpless and reduced to a toddler state for a short while having to have help even getting to the bathroom the first couple of days--but help I got and good, caring, kind help, too.  Granted, most of the time it was some young guy -30 years old and a CNA (Certified Nursing Assistant), but they were a big help since it was hard for me to even stand those first few days. And the first week I couldn't even get my legs in the bed again once I got out, so I was constantly having to call for help (they give you a life alert necklace to wear while there with a button to turn the call lights on), and someone always came and helped me. The food, by the way, at Sante was excellent...really!  I'm a good cook myself, and the food there was just really top quality--and huge servings most of the time, too.  You can get whatever you want almost any time of the day there with the only requirement is you have to get yourself to the dining room. Physical therapy/occupational therapy was every day for a half hour each, and I got lots of helpful tips from the people there about how to get better and not injure myself.  Really helpful. I loved my stay at Sante, and am really surprised at the negative comments here.  However, let me say, if a patient there is unable to speak or call for help I can imagine they would have a very hard time at Sante as nobody stays in your private room waiting for you to call. For me, tho, Sante has some little activities daily like movies, candy bar bingo, a chocolate tasting--just little easy to do activities that require no thinking really--for the patients to enjoy. Personally, I found the staff to be filled in general (a few exceptions) with happy, caring medical staff who really want to see you improve and get well.  I would not hesitate to go back there if I needed to, and I am really sorry others have not had the same experience I had. By the way, the facility itself is quite pretty for a rehab and certainly not depressing at all.
1 I was disappointed by this place every time I went. I no longer go after they told me I had appendicitis and needed to go to the hospital. I got to the hospital, they laughed and said I was just dehydrated. Another time I went in they said they couldn't help me and gave me a piece of paper with another doctors contact information. I visited the doctor for about 3 minutes and was still charged. Not sure why they would even book me an appointment for something they couldn't help me with in the first place.
5 Auden is the best!  I spend a lot of time working out and not a lot of time resting or recovering.  Regular massages with Auden keep me healthy.  He is knowledgeable about the body as well as my sport (running) and does a great job helping me work through whatever is hurting.  His massages are not what I would call relaxing, but they effectively cover all the muscles I need massaged and he helps stretch me out and release tight joints.
1 While I'm not sure that there is better care elsewhere do to the current state of the healthcare system; I have to hope so.  The staff at the front desk were nice enough. Maybe the insurance I've always had or maybe this is the way it is, but I haven't seen a 'real' doctor in decades. Here again, I saw PAC - Jeremy Scheibaum. Have to say, he seemed terrific!!! I was SO hopeful because he didn't rush, he was thorough, honest, knowledgeable. Really terrific. However, I think he needs to work at a place that appreciates his kind of care.   I went in for a full physical, blood tests etc.. as it's important to me to know the state of my health. About a week later, some girl called me with the follow up message. She was clearly extremely rushed and needed to get these phone calls done. She was exasperated when I asked a question about something she'd said and I realized it's because she has no clue what she is saying, she is going through some script or something.  I called back and left a message for Jeremy to call me as I wanted actual detailed results of my tests rather than the -everything is fine- statement I got from the girl. The next day another woman called me back for him. When I asked for actual results, numbers and are those within good range or bad, or what... she was not forthcoming with my results and was becoming very irratated that I wouldn't just take - "all you need is Vit D" for an answer. I wanted to compare my results with last time to see if I'm keeping my cholesterol down and stuff like that. Seems reasonable to me. With every question she made sure I knew she was more and more annoyed with me. I finally asked, 'Why are you annoyed that I want the results of my tests? And why don't you just send them to me anyway!?" She said, 'fine, she'll mail them'. Well, of course, she never did.   Two weeks later I got my bill from Sonoran Labs which reminded me that I never got the results from the tests for which I am now being billed. I called Pueblo Family Physicians back.   This time I asked for and think I got a manager who was very nice and apologized that she never sent the results to me. She sent them and I got them 2 days later. HOWEVER, what I still have a problem with is that when I asked this nice, intelligent, reasonable manager why it's not just common practice to provide test results, the answer floored me. She doesn't know about other places, but at Pueblo Family Physicians, they just keep them and go over it with you next time. Really? I said, but what if you report to me that my cholesterol is 'normal' because it's at the top of the range and since I wouldn't know that, I don't have an opportunity to make any changes to keep it out of the *high* zone? You just wait till next time, after a person has had another 6-12mos to damage their health? Yes.  That doesn't make sense to me. I think the healthcare system is so strained, this may be the norm everywhere. I really don't know. But I'm going to try somewhere else because I don't think it's good. FYI
5 From my experience here I have never had a bad experience this is the second time I have used this place, in fact my husband has used them also and never had a problem. The place is clean no funny smells and the staff always pleasant.    I've seen some of the negative reviews and they do not make sense. So I hope when people read this review as well as others look at what the negative reviewers expectations were. Also read other reviews they have written many people on YELP will only write a negative review.   I highly recommend this place for your care!!
1 I made an appointment and was VERY specific on the procedure I needed. I was assured the Peoria off ice could do the procedure. However, after driving 30 minutes to get there, I was told they can't do the procedure. Lack of training for your front office means inconveniences for patients. Time to find a new Dr. The office manager wasn't apologetic and offered no solution. Definitely not recommended. So much for their Christian values.
5 Dr maxwell is amazing. I e never really cared for any family Drs until I met him. Office was clean and beautiful. Staff was very nice. The dr himself greeting you with his warm and funny personality. Everything was addressed and left me feeling like I found a new home. They even have a bloodwork lab so you don't have to go to one of the other offices with huge waiting times. Thank you Dr maxwell and staff! You guys rock!
5 Staff here is AMAZING beyond words can say I went to their central location a few days ago and i walked right out. NEVER go to their central location. I has such a bad experience i went back to my doctor (dr. yee) and told him to NEVER send patients to that location only to Jackson PT on durango. After a day of therapy i am ready for the next. and very excited Great work guys and yay to the new opening office as that one is going to be closer to my job !!! (:
4 I see Dr. Fazz and am very happy with him. But I think he's pry the most popular doctor cause it's practically impossible to get an appointment with him without scheduling way in advance. I've seen a few of the other doctors and PAs also and they are nice enough. No real complaints to share. Definitely a busy office, so you do end up waiting a bit. I really appreciate that they will go above and beyond to find you an appointment if you really need to see a doctor. They are busy, but they definitely put their patients first. A Sonora Quest Labs is right next door too, so if you have any bloodwork or other tests that need to be run, it's really convenient to just walk next door! You don't have to worry about driving to a separate location or anything like that. I recommend their office. I don't come more than a few times a year; and I have no complaints!
5 I have only been seen here three times and Dr Caleb Lauber is the best Dr I have ever seen he pays attention to detail and goes over everything there is no time restriction he answers all your questions and is genuinely concerned about you as a person as well as a patient. the only down fall is his assistant she is rough around the edges not an inviting spirit, she doesn't make you feel comfortable and she is not friendly, other than that a perfect setting everything a patient could ask for.
5 01.16.17 another great appointment with Thomas (follow up from my physical).  I can tell the people here really care.  I can also tell the staff holds Dr. Turner in high esteem.  I have been fortunate to receive their health care for many years.  I'm not going anywhere.  These people are good at it and they care.   Dr. Turner, great work building your practice.  I just had another positive experience today.  I really like your concept of preventative.  One of your people said; "to keep you alive until 105."  You are a fine man and you have built a great organization.  I am so grateful for your contributions to medicine and our community.  I hope to have you many more.
4 Although the wait is extremely long past the appt time, Dr Lyons is great! He's really nice to and he assures you not to worry. I didn't feel rushed at all like most doctors, and he was behind schedule, just a little.
5 Linda Austin is the most wonderful doctor and I can't believe my good luck in finding her when I first moved to Phoenix. She's thorough, listens to your concerns and takes them seriously, takes her time and doesn't rush you out the door but at the same time doesn't keep you waiting in the waiting room. She's courteous and kind but professional and knowledgeable at the same time. She's always willing to look things up when she isn't sure and not just make  snap judgments and stick to them, something that sometimes seems a rare character trait in the medical profession. I can't recommend Dr. Austin highly enough. I've lived in western and eastern Canada, Germany, and Boston before moving to Phoenix and she's hands down the best doctor I've ever seen. If you're looking for a new physician, you won't regret switching to her.
5 I was referred to Dr. George by a coworker and was completely impressed with his knowledge, patience and thoroughness. His practice is well run and because of his large medical network he can get quick test results or set up a specialist without the long wait. He is one of the top doctors I have seen in years!
5 Unfortunately the swelling returned about 3 weeks after I thought I had beaten it. Since the antibiotics did not work, Dr Vella had to schedule me for surgery. I was excited as I was suffering in severe pain and could not move my left middle finger.  Dr Vella happened to be going out of town for the rest of the week but he told me his partner Dr Haber was available to do my surgery. Dr Haber was very nice and professional. He did a great job. Now it has been over 1 week since the surgery and I am slowly improving. Just wanted to update that the TOCA team is great and they did a great job!
1 First off Dr. Adams is an amazing doctor however that doesn't help anyone when her front office is horrible and you can't get in to see her! I saw Dr. Adams for the first time in September she ordered a lot of tests that I needed and requested a CAT scan (she really wanted me to get done). I was referred out to a CAT scan provider that doesn't take my insurance so I called along with the CAT scan facility to get a referral to go somewhere else and along with getting Dr. Adam's message machine which says, "DO NOT CALL A SECOND TIME" I left a message and never got a call back, from September! I did my blood work she ordered which several things came back out of normal range/positive and when I called to follow up, AGAIN I got the offices message machine last week twice with no call back. So along with being upset over my out of whack blood work and still feeling sick I went down to their office which is 30mins away from where I live to talk to the office in person. Then today, I show up at 4:10pm on a Monday and the doors are locked. Right above the locked doors is a sign that reads their hours Monday-Friday 8:30am-4:30pm!   So disappointed, its really hard to find a good doctor that actually cares about their patients, too bad the office staffs actions show the complete opposite!!!
1 Well I gave him a bad review then he told me I was cured of something i found out later has no cure.  Don't know if they are related but another doctor told me two tests were exactly the same. So for him to tell me I was fine in the first place says he doesn't care or he doesn't know what he's doing.
1 The worst of the worst. The longeste wait (over 2hrs)The doctor saw me only for 5min. He was offhanded and unkind with a terrible bedside manner. He treated me as if I had no worth and had no value. I walked out stunned, bumped into a friendly person on my way out to the parkinglot and it suddenly hit me, how beautiful kindness is. The only good thing I took away from this doctor, was the inspiration to be a kinder and more gentle person. I will never reccommend this place. Ever.
5 I've only pre-registered to be a patient, but it's been smooth going so far and I was able to do everything online. Excited to have found a modern clinic in riverside / leslieville that's accepting new patients!
1 Before I even start, I want to make note that this is the very first physical therapy session I have ever experienced, so I honestly don't have any other facility to compare Tim Soder's to. If I did, I might give it 2 stars instead of 1. I was recently diagnosed with 'ischial bursitis' and was told by my orthopedic specialist that I would need a couple weeks of physical therapy, going 2-3 times a week. I guess my orthopedic office has a type a partnership with Tim Soder's since they had a representative at the office at the time to schedule an appointment.   At my first visit, they spent about 1.5 hrs with me. The first 30-45 min was to diagnose the areas that needed to be worked on and I guess set-up a plan for me to follow. The rest of the time was spent in the gym area doing light stretches and exercises. When I was with the physical therapy specialist (?) it was okay, the disappointment started at the 'gym time'. After the diagnosis was done, I was handed off to an athletic trainer. He had me do some warm-ups and some stretches and walked off to help others. There were at least 10 other people in the gym room. Like I said, this is my first time but I honestly thought it was going to be more one-on-one type of an appointment and definitely more attentive. After I was done with each exercise, I'd have to walk across the room to ask him what's next. Seriously, after EVERY EXERCISE. Half way through, he handed me off to another athletic trainer. Same service. At one point of the night I had to wait for him to finish his conversation with his friends for him to give me my next exercise/stretch.  As I was leaving, the receptionist asked me, "So you're only doing gym time for next session right?" Um, isn't that something she should be telling me and not asking me? I just told her no one mentioned anything to me and she looked back at her notes and was like, "oh yes, looks like you are.." I was definitely not very happy with the first appointment.   I decided to not judge too hard, because I really was in no position to have that many expectations.  I thought I'd give it another try to see if maybe the 2nd session would be better. Nope. Same thing. Except this time, there was no 'treatment time'. No one was curious on how I felt after the first session? If I'm sore? If I'm hurting? I had to ask them for different exercises and they were able to give me at least some idea of how to realign my pelvic bone.   If they had showed me their plan over the next few weeks on what they wanted to work on, like exercises and expected progress, that might have motivated me to return. But with the service I was getting, I felt like I was just throwing $60 down the drain for each 40min session.
5 DIPT deserves a ten star rating. From start to finish, beginning with Judie at the front desk who is an absolutely master at scheduling your appointment, to Dave, who is the very best physical therapist I have ever worked with, to Joey, who is the master at getting you to stretch, work and build the area that needs work, everyone at DIPT is world-class. Whether you need to rebuild an area from a work, sports, or long-term injury, DIPT is the first and only physical therapy facility to go to. I recommend DIPT without question.
5 LOVE  AZ Pain Relief!  I had been in pain for months with chronic lower back pain. MRI results were not favorable. I didn't want to be on medication to "fix" me. AZ Pain Relief team put a plan together to get me feeling better. 12 weeks of commitment, 3 times a week with Chiropractic, injections, physical therapy and massage therapy I am happy to say my pain is gone! Hard work and the right treatment I am pleasantly surprised at the results. Dr. Myers and team are very positive and caring to your needs. At times I was not thinking I was getting anywhere but they listened to my pains and adjusted treatment to get the relief I needed.   Don't wait to get the treatment you need. I waiting to long for no reason. I'm happy that I found them through Yelp and great comments from other patients that is what got me to call.   Thank you AZ Pain Relief!
4 We had a very good experience with St. Michael's Hospital. My daughter was delivered there. Some highlights are:  - Great nurses - of course not all of them are perfect, but even those that I didn't like that much didn't do anything wrong. - Great infrastructure - everything looks clean and new. - Delivery - all staff employed in the actual delivery were caring, dedicated professionals. The nurse that actually made the delivery was terrific, she was patient, optimistic, focused and was of paramount importance to the successful outcome.  One of my favourite experiences regarding this hospital was this: your obgyn probably gives you a pamphlet early in your pregnancy with your "schedule". This pamphlet is actually from the hospital, and it tells you what you should do in each week (this week there's the anatomical ultrasound, this week you should book prenatal classes, etc). There was saying that we should book the hospital tour at the 35th week (I guess). I called them and they told me that I actually should have called one month earlier, because they were fully booked. I pointed out that they were the ones that told me to do that at that time but the lady was unmoved. I left a message to the Patient Affairs department just asking them to fix their material, because if people rely on the pamphlet they are in for a surprise - expecting nothing more than a fake "alright, sir, will do". They actually called me, very concerned about us not making the tour, and arranged us to be on the next one. I was very impressed.  St. Michael's is a great place to have a baby. It makes me even more happy to realize that everybody can have the same opportunity as we did, regardless of their wallet size. God I love Canada.
5 Dr. Hudson is great. Very professional and I am pain-free now. He found the root of the problem, rather than just adjusting for a short term fix. Would highly recommend!
2 Meh, I've experienced better.  Patients need to feel welcomed and encouraged through their sessions.  The front desk personnel look overwhelmed at times due to the amount of patients arriving, and the front lobby area gets congested. The rehab curriculum is good, but a high turnover with the therapists is experienced.
5 What an amazing experience!!! Brent really knows what he is doing and knows how to execute an amazingly therapeutic and productive massage.  From the moment I contacted him to the last stroke of his strong hands and elbows, his execution was absolutely impeccable and professional. Brent recently left the spa trade and made the decision to build his own clientele in Las Vegas by operating his own massage business.  His studio is conveniently located in Henderson next to the Galleria Mall and Sunset Station Area, so you'll be able to get to him within 20-30 mins from anywhere in Las Vegas.  It's inside a medical plaza that was clean and easily accessible off of Warm Springs. His years of experience is clearly evident from his touch. It's not everyday that you experience a therapist with such intuition and expert knowledge of the human anatomy.  While I asked Brent to perform a massage that employed a deeper pressure, he was was well connected enough with my body to understand that it needed other modalities.  He is very much experienced in other methods and also suggested a bit of cupping on my upper back. It was the most unique sensation!! If you've never had it, I recommend you have it done with Brent. He suggested that we use this method as it could release the fascia and relax the muscles even further.  After the massage, I was so relaxed and in such a state of euphoria that I did not want to get off his table.  The only negative about this experience was that it ended and that I had to drive myself home. I could have been perfectly fine rolling over and taking a nap right then and there!  If you're ready to feel amazing, then get your appointment with Brent ASAP!!
5 OH MY GOODNESS!! WHAT a relaxing experience I had at Opulent. I rarely get massages, but decided to treat myself to a nice hour-long deep tissue massage. I have been really stressed at work and have had a hard time sleeping....I also hold a lot of tension in my neck that I try to help with yoga, but I noticed hasn't been doing the trick. I let Chris know that I hold a lot of tension in my neck and upper back so I get really bad migraines sometimes. He completely loosened up that area but still made sure to pay attention to other areas of the back, which was great! I definitely would recommend Chris at Opulent! I'll DEFINITELY be going back.
1 Was going here for over three years and kept going through several doctors as they kept leaving the practice themselves to go elsewhere. The last straw was when I got a bill for something I had treated there many times before, my insurance claimed they billed it wrong, which they wouldn't correct, so after months of fighting with them, over a year to be exact, I ended up paying the bill. When I decided to leave, it took them months to transfer my records to my new doctor. Unfortunately my doctor left his practice to start his own but won't be up and running for a few months, so I called to make an appointment and they told me I couldn't return, that they would not take me back. How is that for service after over three years of business?
1 This place is horrible! The beds give buttsores, the care is horrible, and the food is disgusting. Example of the care, we've hit the call button and the longest time we have waited is 20 minutes and the second longest time is 14 minutes. Also, someone in the room over, their overhead light (which indicates someone has pressed the call button and needs help) has been blinking red for about 5 minutes, and that was when I first saw it, it was probably blinking before I saw it. Also, at one point I went out to the actual nurse's station and there were no nurses anywhere to be found, and I walked down two hallways, plus a few yards down each of the branches that branched off the hallway. If you want your parent to die, send them here.
1 I just moved to this area & woke up one morning with a horrible rash. I searched for an urgent care & this came up. My husband called & was told I could come in at 10:15. This place is NOT AN URGENT CARE CENTER!! They just take walk in patients. To advertise as "urgent care" is not accurate. The co-pay was much higher than my insurance requires for a PCP. The staff here seems to be very inexperienced. We waited quite a while to see the doctor & when he did arrive I could barely understand him. He did not even look at my rash & didn't seem to care about the history that I gave him that might have assisted in a diagnosis. He said only "you must be allergic to something." His nurse gave me a shot of steroids & then he came back in a while later with 4 prescriptions. I did not need any of these prescriptions!!!! I left the office very unsatisfied. The steroid injection did make the rash disappear by the next day but I have no further idea what I need to do to keep from getting it again. The doctor wants me to come back to establish care there & I had to fill out paperwork as a new patient before I was seen. I WILL NOT BE COMING BACK HERE-----EVER!!!!
1 LONGEST WAIT EVER. We came 30 minutes early, got put in the room 15 minutes before the appointment just wait another hour after the appointment. Horrible place to come. Defiantly don't recommend it.
3 One complaint!  Michael that answers the phones is just so mean.  He has no patience and never listens.  It is quite frustrating.  When calling to explain to him something he just repeats himself like a robot and you find yourself talking over him so then he complains that you are yelling and he hangs up.  I was left in tears from him this last time, but feel relieved to know it wasn't all me since my friend and two other family member ALL that I referred here to has experienced the same issues with him.  So sad.  Too many people need jobs and he obviously does not like his nor people the way he speaks to those that are suffering in some way.  My advice to you is not to get him on the phone or you will feel even worse than when you called about your pain in the first plain OR just be prepared so you do take think it is all you that did wrong.  On a nicer note-  Gina on the phones is awesome, understanding, and quite passionate.
5 Dr is friendly and helpful! Spent time and answered all my questions. Would definitely go back and recommend!
5 I've suffered from sciatica pain while I was pregnant and thank goodness I found Dr. Polk!!!! Her kind and Gentle approach helped get through my pregnancy with less pain.  6 yrs later she continues to help me with me neck and shoulder Pain. Dr. Polk takes time and never rushes, unlike other chiropractors out there. Her treatment is customised to ones needs after all we are not all made the same way.  I drive over 45 minutes to her office because she is worth it!  I highly recommend her.
2 Where to start? The facility is clean and they have a more than adequate physical therapy area. The issues are a staff that is overwhelmed.  They are overwhelmed mainly because of disorganization and apathy.  When asked about the plans for my brother in law I received nothing, no plans.  They gave him a sulfa based antibiotic when his chart clearly stated he was allergic to sulfa based products.  He developed a wound that was the size of a silver dollar (the old big silver dollars) due to lack of changing dressings and then was told that he should have notified them that this was going on.  His room mate was given food but needed to be helped to eat it but that did not occur, I overheard the resident say he eats by himself all the time and the family was livid.  He passed away a few days later.  I cannot comment on other facilities but this one is filled with incompetence and apathy.
1 I really really hate to be the one to write the first bad review, but this was no where near worth coming to. I have REALLY good health coverage and my co-pay was 30 bucks for one. And 2, I got NOTHING out of it but a cracked back and neck and a plastic ball I had to pay for. I could've spent 19 and got an hr long massage that would have worked out my issue. He felt the knot on my back. Everton kept saying go to chiropractor through insurance, they'll be able to massage you out too blah blah blah. I was in and out so fast that by the time I got home, what small relief I had is now gone. I couldnt afford that and I still paid anyways and so mad I did smh.
5 I have been seeing Dr Docasar for several years now. She is the most caring Doctor that I have seen. She takes the the time to answer any concerns or questions I have. Dr Docasar is extremely knowledgeable and makes me feel that I am important NOT just another patient! I highly recommend her!
1 Dr w.wu is so rude. They treated my mom just terrible. Another patient was talking in the waiting room about how his wife has been treated my wu. Dr Burkhead won't even stick up for his patients when we said something about how she was treated.  This PA Pam is such a witch. She told my mom she had to go to a surgeon, but didn't mention this Lady worked for him. We wondered why the Dr wouldn't tell my mom she had to go to the surgeon. My mom was crying and scared and brought it to Dr Burkhead attention via his receptionist but they didn't even care or stand up for the patient. When my mom started crying BC she was scared this witch(Pam) said "Do you need to see a psychology Dr. She never asked my mom why she was scared ( it was BC after her first spinal surgery she stopped breathing. Dr Burkhead didn't care. He won't stand up for the patient. Im waiting to file some reports of stuff. Don't go here there are many Dr better. Ask around and read their reviews. All these patients can't be wrong. God bless
5 I am a patient at the West Phoenix CORE location.  I called the main office because I was very concerned about insurance for my scheduled surgery, and my concerns were getting fluffed off by the staff at West Phoenix.  I was ready to cancel and start all over with a new surgeon in a different office.  Fortunately, I got Kellie and she took the time to listen and address my concerns.  She was able to reassure me from her personal experience that the authorization from my insurance would be done before I entered the hospital, and if there were any problems CORE would contact me.  They would not proceed and leave me to figure out how to pay the hospital bill when/if the insurance denied it.  If only every medical facility had a Kellie on their staff, the trauma of surgery would be lessened.  Thank you, Kellie
3 Very busy place and usually a delayed time to see the doctor even if you have an appointment set.
1 If I could give him no stars, I would. I recently relocated here from California and was looking for a pediatrician. I contacted his office to get my daughter in for her 4 month old shots. Appt was set up and I thought everything was okay according to his yelp reviews he seems like a legit doctor. Today we woke up and our daughters eyes are basically swollen shut. In the midst of getting her to the emergency room we call his office to get a hold of him of he was on call. After telling him the situation, all I keep getting asked is who would set up the appt for my daughter.. And asking information about insurance. This was already discussed before we chose him as a pediatrician. He tells me over the phone that he doesn't take babies. Why would his office staff set the appointment when I told then her age and what the appointment would be for..
1 Bad bad bad front office staff.. very arrogant Asian lady.. rude to people and makes faces at them.. the front office staff were talking about their weekend instead of seeing to patients.. There was an hour wait , with no information.  Pros: On finally meeting the doctor, it turned out he was a very nice person, the doctor is a very soft spoken gentleman who is very good at what he does.. Clean location.
5 Thorough. Personable. Courteous. Professional. Responsive. All words describe my experience at Physicians Physical Therapy. There are a LOT of Physical Therapy options in this city, but you won't be disappointed here. I felt like a priority. I felt like a person, not just a case they were treating. If you want a clean office, with a courteous staff, and excellent treatment, look no further.
2 This is tough for me as they are still my provider but it is what it is. Don;t get me wrong, every time I get in to see one of the doctors or practitioners, I like the service I get from them. They are straight to the point and honest. But the front office staff? Either get a better organizational tool or ASK FOR HELP!!! I was in the office today for my appointment. Yes there were other patients but not many, considering some were there to see a doctor and some were there for the lab. Yet when I called about 5 minutes after I left to see if they had called in my scripts, I was on hold for just over 9 minutes but had to hang up. Then about 15 to 20 minutes later, I called again and yet again I was on hold, but this time for just over 31 minutes... Seriously? I only stayed on hold that long because I really needed the information. Its sad, but I am going to have to search out a new providers office after being with either this office or the office of the doctor who merged with them for going on 17 years. I would post the screenshot of my call screen showing the 31:30 time on the call if I had that option
1 WORST OFFICE EVER! I needed to get very specific tests verified for my college enrollment that were clearly written out on the paper work they were provided with. It was a simple MMR blood test to verify that I was immune to Rubeola . Simple right? Apparently not! Instead of taking the test for all three of the MMR (Measles - AKA Rubeola, Mumps & Rubella) they only do Rubella, not the needed Rubeola test! When I call to request a new blood draw, cause I love the feel of a needle shoved in my arm, they treat me like it was my fault and tell me they have an appointment in 2 weeks available. As I explain that it is needed in 4 days and needed to be done that day they disconnected the phone and I had to call back on another line.  When they finally agreed to "fit me in" for a second blood draw the Phlebotomist was the queen of nasty and gave me the death glare the entire time.  This office is a complete waste of time and have NO SKILLS for professionalism.  Did I mention that after a year they still can't access my info over the phone since they still have my DOB wrong and can't quite figure it all out?  WINNERS!!!!  You'll have better luck at the morgue...
5 The only chiropractor we go to! Been going here for years and will continue to do so. The friendly and welcoming staff and knowledgeable and caring practitioners make this your go-to place to straighten out
5 My 3 year old daughter fell down while playing and she broke her wrist. We went down to this urgent care and they did x rays and confirmed the minor fracture.  The PA is knowledgeable and was pretty quick too. The service rendered here is 5 star and the facility is clean and comfortable. Every time we pass by my little girl gets excited and screams out the window,  "that's where my doctor is at!  Can I go there again? " my daughter and I highly recommended it.
5 Ryan has been treating me for about 8 months. To say he is the best physical therapist is an understatement. He has treated my knee, shoulder and hip (after a car accident). Ryan is fantastic at not only treating my ailments, he is great at communicating and listening to my concerns. I truly appreciate how Ryan is just as invested in my recovery as I am. He pushes me or slows me down when needed because he is observant. I cannot thank him enough. I also appreciate Katrina and Sara. Both have helped me with billing, scheduling, and are incredibly sweet! After all that's happened since my accident I rest easy knowing I have such awesome support. Thank you all!
5 Again, extremely satisfied with Dr. Patel! My boyfriend and I have both been going. I am excited to be able to be comfortable with a doctor for the very first time! He helps you understand the medications and why he recommends them and how they will help. He is a sincere doctor and I would recommend him to anyone and everyone!
5 I started going to Function when my private pilates instructor was teaching FST.  I was a bit nervous as I have some physical issues that my instructor, Ashley knows very well!  Ashley also teaches @ Function some Saturdays.  She assured me that Torin was very knowledgeable and would be a good fit for me.  She was absolutely right!  Love her style in class! Only 3 people in group classes.  Give it a try....you will love it!
1 Worst place I have ever been too, they not only violated basic principles of their profession by discontinuing medical care to my husband while he was in the midst of an ongoing medical problem that has not resolved,  they also would not give me any of my daughters test results even after she gave them permission to contact me, they said she was a minor so they couldn't tell her over the phone and since I, her mother wasn't the patient they couldn't give me any result info, she needed to make an appointment. They have their patients make appointments for every little thing, and to top it off they emailed me someone elses medication information and personal information!!!! I'm wondering if that is something that I should turn into the medical board, how many other people have they done that too!!!
5 Took advantage of their Groupon offer last month & sent my hubby in for a massage for his birthday.  He absolutely loved it.  Very clean, comfortable and relaxing environment.  He was extremely relaxed and was told that his back had a few knots that needed to be worked out.  Their deep tissue massage is top notch.    If they're having a deal-- Take your mother, sister or sweetheart here, for sure.
5 I have never enjoyed, or looked forward to going to physical therapy until becoming a patient at Contact.  This office is incredible!  Every staff member makes you feel welcome and comfortable.  Tammy is a gem.  She is so kind, pleasant, helpful and caring.  Morgan, my PT, is a joy.  She is well educated, confident, patient, kind, cautious and has a great sense of humor!  Contact has made a miserable shoulder injury tolerable and hopeful!  Thank you Contact!
5 have to say a quick thank you to Dan for helping me out I have a hectic work schedule does not let me go in at regular times from a b12 shot. Is taking time out of his busy schedule to fit me in a little later for my shop to make sure I get my shot. thank you again for your help!
2 I recently visited Center for Athletic Performance and Physical Therapy after dislocating my shoulder and tearing my labrum. I'd like to first point out I did not once work with an actual Physical Therapist. Each of the 4 visits I was placed with a different tech to walk me through shoulder exercises. Once they showed me the exercises rather than stay with me to make sure I was doing them correctly, they would walk away to help someone else. After finishing my exercise sets I would have to go find the tech to tell me what to do next, often waiting around while they helped someone else. At the end of my exercise routine rather than working with one of the physical therapists I was placed with a student every time! Again, I never once worked with an actual physical therapist. Since I was paying for physical therapy sessions, I wanted to work with an actual physical therapist which seems more than reasonable. I am not sure how they can claim to care about me or my injury if they think it is acceptable to run their office in this manner.
5 Going to the new Green Valley location and couldn't be more pleased with the care and concern provided by all the staff from reception to the techs and therapists!  I would recommend this facility to anyone needing physical therapy.
5 Dr. Bauer and his staff are the best in town.  If you want excellent healthcare, I recommend Bauer Family Medicine!  KGS, PAC.
5 I would like to mention that the Mesa office is NOT closed. I have an appointment to go there today. I believe their Gilbert office is still open as well. They are are very good doctors office. I can almost always get a same day appointment or an appointment within a couple of days. Even if they are booked up, they will find a way to squeeze me in if it is something urgent (like a migraine). Dr. Jensen is very caring and listens.
5 I had a total knee revision and went through quite a bit of pain with my left knee. I had my right knee replaced 6 years ago as well. This was the first time I have gone to Key Physical Therapy. Ryan is truly the best therapist I have been to by far. He knows how to get results in a professional and gentle way and has excellent bedside manner. Hands down I would recommend Ryan over and over again. Don't settle! Go to the best therapist! You will be happy you did!  Linda B.
1 Can I give it no stars? This place was FILTHY! It looks good when you first walk in but when you sit for 2 hours you start to notice things such as everyone coming out of the bathroom going straight to the hand sanitizer. It wasn't until my husband used it that we found out the soap dispenser was broken & there were no paper towels. The seats have silver arm rests but were covered in smears. When I was called I asked to use restroom & it appeared clean but when you sat down on toilet you were looking at a cabinet/table which holds the urine sample cups. There was what appeared to be urine spilled down the front of it. Gross! Next back to room & when I went to close the door I noticed a large semi circle area of dirt built up around the door handle. I got a paper towel & put a large amount of hand sanitizer on towel & cleaned it. I was not going to touch that handle area without cleaning it. I also noticed the chairs in the room were dirty also. This is the kind of dirt that builds up over time.  The medical treatment was OK but I had a sample given & the doctor tried to tell me what was wrong with me without ever running the sample. I also asked for exact detailed results including lab results so I could provide this information to my doctor but I didn't get it even when I asked again. I waited in the room after the doctor saw me for another 30 minutes just for paperwork.   I will not use this location again when I'm in Vegas & I'm going to contact my insurance company regarding them also. How can you call yourself a medical care center when you are treating sick people but not cleaning on a regular bases.
5 My shoulder was hurting so much to the point I was not sleeping well.  I needed some relief and nothing I did help me.  I went to see Dr. Curtis Page and he took a xray of my neck and referred me to springbok wellness and rehab which right in the same office.  Lisa called me for an appt and she was so accommodating to my needs.  I went not thinking this would work but I really was very impressed with Lisa and her staff.  She was very careful to be clear and thorough with me.  She was very patient and very friendly as well as the staff.   I have only been there four times but my shoulder already feels so much better and every time I have an issue or question they are all very patient, supportive, friendly and thorough.  I enjoy going and now I'm sleeping better.
4 I couldn't find this anywhere on here so I decided to add it myself.  Tammy is totally awesome!  She knows what she is doing w/massage.  Her skills are amazing and she makes one feel so comfortable.  Pricing is reasonable, location is good.  Go there and try it.  You won't go wrong.
5 This place is the best. Other Chiros pump you in and out like a factory line but Dr. Steve always takes the extra time if needed.  I tore my MCL awhile back and the next day I couldn't walk.  Went to my MD and he gave me Pain killers and MRI appointment.  Told me to stay away from Chiro's.  I went straight to Dr. Steve, he did some awesome Mr. Miagi action on my knee and I was walking out of there pain free!  I avoided surgery and the cost of a $400 MRI. Never used my pain killer meds as well  His staff is excellent and you get a complimentary massage before your adjustment.
5 Pain stop was there for me in a time of need. Got a same day appointment. Dr Mitch is awesome, caring and truly concerned on getting me back to being me. Staff is great too.
5 Best massage I've ever gotten! Brent is professional but still laid back and down to earth. The massage was phenomenal. He has very strong hands, yet I never felt he was hurting me. Brent knows how to apply hlthe perfect amount of pressure.   Oh and with these awesome rates... I'll be back very frequently
1 I've been coming here for years, it was mostly because I loved my dr so much that I've put up with this office for so long. The past few times I've come in though, I ended up with someone else. He's fine too, but if I have to start seeing someone else I'll just find an office closer to my house.  Every appointment I have here takes FOREVER. I'm literally sitting in the exam room and it's 20 more minutes until I've been here for 2 hours (passed my appointment time) and I still haven't seen the doctor! I'm literally here for blood work results. What's the point of scheduling an appointment (mind you they sent me a letter to reschedule this one) if you're too busy? I've really begun to resent this office. The girls in the front always put you on hold when you call in, then aren't very friendly face to face. They sent me a letter to reschedule my appointment because they were over booked (I set up this appointment about 3 weeks in advance)... The letter says they tried to call but my phone number was invalid? I've been coming here for years and always had the same number. I came in to ask the staff and a girl at the front told me they send those out instead of calling to save time? Seriously? How pathetic and lazy. I guess it's officially time for me to find a new doctors office.
5 I've seen Dr. Rudd off and on for back pain and knee pain.  He has been incredible at fixing my issues in the short term and more importantly long term.  His hours are great, he is knowledgeable, gentle and empathetic.  I've been to a couple Chiropractors and they have been good but I recommend Dr. Rudd over any of them.
5 Found this place through my insurance and I really love it.  I generally see one of 2 PA's for my needs and they are bright and very nice.  Further, everything is clean and friendly. Its not fancy, but they get the job done and I feel confident about the care I receive.
5 I recently moved to Chandler from Chicago. Searching for a new doctor can be quite the worry. I'm happy to say my hubby and I are completely satisfied with both Dr Lily Delatte and Dr Drew Hall at the Gilbert facility.  Both were friendly and informative. They really asked great questions and took their time with us. I went to Dr Delatte and hubby was seen by Dr Hall.  Since I have several controlled medical issues I was happy to find a wonderful practice.  The office staff was just as wonderful and I am confident that we have found the perfect medical match for us. Thank you!
1 So, my therapist got me at 12:07. Ok not too late. She gave me her name and said we'll be upstairs. Ok no warmth or handshake maybe it's not her thing. I told her the two areas that gave me trouble and she told me to lay down face up. She didn't ask what kind of pressure I liked. She didn't adjust the foam roller to the appropriate place nor at any time was I asked how I was feeling. The room was cold and if she just asked once I would've told her because me obviously shivering wasn't enough. Unfortunately, this was THE worst massage I've ever had and at one point I thought it was a joke! She missed every area that was common to massage and i was just being lightly rubbed with oil in between her loud gulps of water. At one point I looked up to see where she went. Most good therapists keep at least one hand on you or stay near you. The energy which would've made up for the massage wasn't good either. No soft voice. No gentle movements moving the sheet or my body parts. I almost got up and left but then remembered I was naked! So, I was going to let the front desk know about my experience when they asked because every place I've ever been HAS asked. Guess what?  They didn't. They just took the tips and gift cards and that was it. I'm in customer service and this was unacceptable.  I can see if I was impolite, rude or just a plain old bitch then you'd maybe try to just get me out of their. I just smiled and barely said two words because it was obvious no one cared in the first place. I've had many massages in the past and not every one was perfect however, whether it be the energy or the massage one made up for the other. Nothing was good here and probably shouldn't have even tipped.
5 I've been coming to PPT for 5 weeks now and I am very pleased with my whole experience. Everyone that works at PPT is extremely nice and it is pleasant to just be in the building.  The physical therapists there are informative and knowledgable. They make it easy to understand your condition and are always wanting to improve you.  I am very happy with my services that I have received and I would definitely recommend Physicians Physical Therapy to anyone who needs it.
5 I've been coming here for several years now.  Always get a DEEP massage that works out any knots, aches and pains, etc.  The staff is friendly and informative!  I do have a specific incident where Toronto Bodyworks seriously SAVED ME though!  Couple years ago I was at a friend's pool party, jumping in and out of the water like a fool and having a great time.  As the party wrapped up, I went to move a lawn chair....A LAWN CHAIR... all of 3 lbs!.... and somehow managed to pinch a nerve between my shoulder blades.  This caused every muscle in my neck to seize up to the point where I couldn't move my head at all without experiencing severe pain.  In other words, I was in trouble!! I promptly visited a doctor who gave me muscle relaxants, etc, but she also highly recommended a deep massage.  I immediately booked an appointment with Bodyworks and was in there the next day. Let me just say that after this massage, I felt 90% better.  I mean, I went from not being able to turn my head 1cm, to having a few inches in range of motion, instantly!  Also a lot of the pressure in the damaged area was gone.  They recommended some stretches and gave me some great advice on how to avoid this type of injury in the future.  Needless to say that I was in a desperate situation before this massage.  I felt as though I had done serious, permanent damage to my neck prior to coming here.  I never realized I could get that much relief, so quickly.  Kudos to Toronto Bodyworks!  People should also know though, that this is not a spa.  This is a no-frills therapeutic massage establishment.  If what you're looking for is an intense massage that actually benefits you, then look no further!
5 My parents have been seeing Doctor Palmer for 10+ years. He has done amazing things for both of them.  I'm now seeing Doctor Myers and she has done such amazing work improving my life!  I can't thank her enough.  Always excited to go and always feel great walking out. Keep working miracles!
4 I've been to several urgent care offices through the years. I think this is one of the best I've been to. The office is nicely appointed and clean. We took our son there and waited about 15 minutes. The next time we went there we waited 1.5 Hours. It was flu season. I expect to wait when I go to a place such as urgent care or the emergency room. I have always found the staff at this particular office very professional and very nice.
5 I'm surprised to see that there've been negative reviews about Desert View Family Medicine since my (and my husband's) experiences have been nothing short of wonderful.  We found Dr. Gordon Donesky on Healthgrades.com, and he has lived up to the hype! It was gently explained to me by one of the Front Office gals that he does tend to run a little behind, but that's only because he takes a good deal of time with his patients. And isn't that exactly what you want from a doctor? I've never felt rushed through an appointment, and Dr. Donesky takes the time to make sure all of my questions and concerns have been met before he moves onto his next patient.   Moreover, they give their patients access to their entire medical record via an online portal. I can check out my labs or essentially print off my entire medical profile if I need to. How cool is that?  I wouldn't hesitate to refer a friend, a  family member, or a fellow Yelper to this office.  Thanks, Dr. Donesky -- for all you do.
1 Total nightmare! My husband and I were involved in a car accident and I was hurt. We were rear ended and pushed into a full size pickup truck in front of us. The young man that hit us only had $25,000. Medical insurance and there were 7 people involved in this wreck, including a 6 year old little girl. My concern was for the child, so I didn't go to ER as recommended by the Fire Department at the scene of the accident.   My seat belt failed on the first impact where I hit my head on the windshield visor. On the second impact, my seat belt caught me very hard against my chest and sent my BP to 260 over 130. I suffer from Mitral Valve Prolapse and an irregular heartbeat, so this just put more rule the fire.  I also had fluid draining from my ear, weakened in my arms, legs, numbness and muscle spasms that I hoped would go away in due time. I waited 34 days before going to My Dr Now, because I was unable to find any doctor that would bill a car insurance company for medical treatment and I have no other health insurance.   We brought the Police accident report as well as the First Responders Medical report from the Fire Department to my appointment at My Dr Now. We saw a NP that suggested we go to ER immediately, great advise if you have the money to pay for it. We didn't have the money, otherwise I would have gone at the time of the accident!   I asked for a copy of my medical records to turn into insurance so we could get reimbursed for our out of pocket costs for this office visit. Well, guess what...this NP had total amnesia to the exact date and time of the onset of this accident, which both me and my husband made crystal clear to her, down to the exact minute and we brought official documents! HELLO? She couldn't remember if it was two months ago, before the accident or two weeks ago, long after the accident.  My Dr Now has been paid in advance of my office visit and they don't care about accurate records. They first said we had to drive over 120 miles, so that I could sign a paper allowing them to correct their error, which we did. Then they still got it wrong, so they said we had to fax them the same paperwork, which we did for another $5.00, with the promise that we would be sent accurate documents...it's been 9 days and counting.   Meanwhile, its been 65 days since my car accident injury and the only treatment I have received is one office call, one brain scan and no follow up because of their refusal to correct their errors.  They tell us they can not correct their errors. What does that tell you about My Dr Now?  I sincerely hope that this review will help someone out there in need of medical care and give a "heads up." I worked in Government Documentation for many years and when anyone tells you that they are unable to correct an error, it's time to pack up your tent and move on.
5 I had my first visit with Dr. Lopez. I was recommended to him by a friend. I went in for my annual checkup I was really nervous but he put my mind at ease he's very professional and keeps me constantly informed on what he is or will do next. I left very happy and confident that I've found my new obgyn. Thank you to dr. Lopez and all the amazing staff.
1 Same as Jo Ann review 10 days ago. Rarely checked in on my Dad. Also got a UTI. Sent to hospital and Sante discharged my dad on a Friday at 2:00pm, holiday weekend, and never called us! My mom figured it out when she went back to his room at 5 to get some things while he was in hospital. We figured we'd be going back to Sante. Nope. Discharged because he wasn't progressing enough, after they told us they would make this decision the following Tuesday. Sent my mothers BP through the roof.  We asked case worker why she didn't call mom to tell her that dad had been discharged....she said they have a lot of patients. Very traumatic experience for our family
5 First impression, this place was warm, cozy, and great service. The staffs very friendly and all the instructors very talkative. I thought I couldn't survived on the 1st day but I did...lol.   For water bottle, they sale very great one from hydro flask. If you forget to bring your mat, you can rent it for $2 and don't forget to spray it with the cleaner outside the studio and hang dry.   Bring a lot of water and 2 big towels (they sale it too if you don't bring one).  You can get cheaper membership on Groupon.  Overall, it's very great experience in here.
1 My experiences with Dr. Donald Cunningham and his staff were extremely disappointing to say the least.  I was treated very condescending and rude, as well as dismissive from Dr. Donald Cunningham and his Hispanic female Medical Assistant, as it stemmed from a recent visit of which I was 10 minutes late due to Scottsdale traffic, and the accusation was brought up that I was 'non-compliant' as a patient when that is further from the truth.  So I didn't appreciate being judged from them as a patient and a Military Veteran.  So I have to add that they're not veteran friendly, and that from my observation they also displayed behavior that indicates that they 'protect' there staff when there staff provides poor service, to make the patient appear out of touch with their own complaints.  Dr. Leroy Kareus was my initial Doctor, but sadly he passed away.  In my own opinion, he was the 'gentle soul' of that practice.  I will now locate a new family medical practice that appreciates their patients and America's Veterans.
5 If you're looking for a unique experience or want to try something new, look no more. I bought Groupons for myself and my boyfriend- $20 for one session. After initially driving past the business (it's on the side of a building with no signage out front), we parked and were greeted inside by an adorable rescue dog named Loretta. After filling out paperwork, the owner Tom gave us a tour and explained to us the Cryotherapy process. The place was clean and organized, and had a cool modern vibe. My boyfriend went first and loved it. I went and was freezing (obviously the point) but Tom did a good job of talking to you so you don't think about how chilly it is. Overall I can definitely see the benefits to Cyrotherapy... I felt great afterwards and for the rest of the day. If we decide to continue it in the future, we will definitely be going to Cloud!
5 Have been going to Dr. Tafreshi now for 7 years and he's a wonderful doctor with nice staff.  A bonus is that the waiting room can be quite entertaining.  Every single time I've gone in, there are some hilarious characters there that love to perform while they await to be seen.  It really does bring a less serious and stressful ambiance to the place.  Tafreshi has a great bedside manner - he listens to my concerns.  I appreciate these guys a lot for being here over the years!
1 Dr. Dahlia has a great bedside manner, however she ordered unnecessary tests every time I went in that were not covered by my insurance.  I told her I was not working and could not continue to pay for the tests after I received bills for over $500.  Then even though her office is "in network" for my insurance I received a bill for $125 for additional office services that weren't covered.  I called the office 4 times to pay the bill over the phone.  I asked for billing and the response I got was "I can leave a message for the nurse."  I wanted billing, not the nurse!!!  I never heard back from anyone and now they have turned me over to COLLECTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The office staff is the absolute WORST EVER!!!!!!!  Several times my pharmacy requested prescription refills and after several days the pharmacy would call me and say they never heard back from the doctor's office.  I would call the doctor's office and they would tell me they didn't have any requests for medication refills, before they even asked for my name.  Then they would tell me I had to come back for follow-up before refills could be authorized and when I went for a follow-up appointment, Dr. Dahlia wanted to order more tests.  It was a vicious cycle and I feel like all they want is to rack up charges.  The office is a complete mess.  As another reviewer mentioned there is paperwork from the floor to the ceiling.  I can see by the reviews that a number of other people have had the same experience with this doctor.  DO NOT GO TO THIS OFFICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5 I came here because I had a sinus infection flair up while on an extended trip in Las Vegas. The reviews were spot on I came in as a walk in and had to wait only 15 or 20 minutes (not bad at all). The staff was very nice and professional. I felt the Dr. was very nice and spend time getting to know my past medical history and seemed to genuinely care about my health.  I did not feel like a number or rushed. I will continue to use his practice when I'm in Las Vegas.
2 Dr Baker gets 5 stars... He is amazing he's helpful and listens to you. He doesn't walk in write something and leave. He knows what he is doing. I went to him for 4 years and then I was in a car accident and I called and asked to get seen after being discharged from the hospital. The staff said I could only see a physician assistant about it. Which was fine I just have never seen one in the office before and didn't know any of them. The woman I met with wanted to know what was going on so I explained my injuries (which were clear) and gave her my disability forms. She filled them out and sent them in. I went back a week later to get the staples removed from my injuries and talked to her about the disability forms from my employer because they say they received incomplete forms. She said that's "not her problem, and I need to know what to do, she has other patients to see, she told me I should be more responsible for the forms" and left the room. I left in tears, I was looking for help and got snapped at. I haven't been back since. The front office staff was always rude and they always seemed like they had some entitlement issues. I have a new office I go to now. Not one of them are as good as Dr Baker but everyone else in his office keep me away from there.
5 I've been receiving therapy at this facility for over six weeks now, after surgery. And will probably be treated here for about another six weeks. I couldn't be happier with the staff, and the progress I've made. I would highly recommend this facility.
5 Cannot say enough positive and wonderful things about Aris!  Started there b/c of a frozen shoulder that my second shoulder MD didn't even think was possible to be helped thanks to some bad decisions by both another ortho and pain mngmt.  He told me that Aris was his A++ team and right he was!  Got my shoulder working in under a month!  after 2 years of pain, stiffness and spasms!  Then Al sent me to a spine MD and the team has been working on helping me w/ cervical/lumber issues (several).  don't know where I'd be w/o their devotion and care.  truly
5 They are really friendly here and always seem willing to help. The doctors are sympathetic and you don't feel like you are wasting their time or embarrassed. I've never had a problem getting an appointment.
2 I have been using this facility for several years.  The doctor's service has been fine, however the office has continually gotten worse.  When calling the office it is usually a minimum wait of 20 minutes.  Several times I have been disconnected.  I feel they need to get better or more office workers who appreciate a persons time.
5 Wonderful Service & Great Experience!!!!!  If you're looking to detox and lose a few extra pounds, I highly recommend Stephanie!!!! Before my first wrap I didn't have much energy, I was in need of a good detox.. After completing only 2 wraps with Stephanie, I feel great!!!  I am full of energy all the time and I feel like I've been renewed!!  And of course the oils are also amazing, Stephanie help me order some!!  She informed me which oils to mix to get different results, I use the oils everyday!!  Thank you Stephanie, for sharing all your knowledge!! And for helping people like me feel so much better!!   I definitely will be back, when I am in town!!!!
4 I have been going to this physio clinic for about 3 years now to treat a few different orthopaedic issues and received the most care and attention by therapist Joon Nah. You always feel welcomed and are greeted with a smile when you walk in by Shirley and Jackie at the front desk. I can honestly say that I haven't been to a clinic where each staff member is courteous, friendly, and attends to your needs right away. I also referred a colleague to the clinic due to some back pain and she was treated and healed in a matter of weeks. She was also very satisfied with the service.
5 Dr. Patel is amazing like everyone else has said. I got my yearly physical with blood panels done through him and I received my results in less than 24 hours via email! This has never happened to me with lab results, ever lol. He talks to you like he wants you as a patient and he asks about your health history instead of making you fill out the long questionnaire about it. I'm glad I found Dr. Patel though yelp and I will be coming back to him for my primary care. Thanks Dr. Patel!
1 This place sent me to collection even though my insurance & I  paid in full on time. Not one bill or phone call and I have lived at the same address for 7 years!!!!! This caused a huge mess for me and staff didn't even care........ Stay away
1 Dr. Demko, this man should not be able to be called a doctor. Huge waist of human life, and not even deserving of one star.
5 Dr McCoy is excellent, as a healthcare provider too I know I got a good Sports med doctor with him. I do agree with some comments that the front desk staff needs improvement.
5 This was my first visit to the office and I was very pleased with the patient service care and how every team member acknowledged you with a smile. Dr. Lopez, took the time to listen and address my concerns. The office was very clean, quiet and welcoming.
1 I'm not surprised that this place was hard to find on yelp. I have had a bad experience at this place and am deeply concerned. I am beginning to question the motives of the "doctors" who work here, and my level of trust and respect for them is declining.   1) I saw Dimitry Bisk  who smelled very sour and wreaked like strong alcohol; his eyes were red, ringed, he looked pale and had slurred speech. He was not going to give me the medicine I needed, which struck me strange. When i asked him why he couldn't prescribe it to me , he said he wanted to send me to a cardiologist and put me through a loophole of tests which were completely unnecessary. I asked him what i could do in the meantime while having my tests done and I questioned his reasoning for all of this. The medicine i asked for, most people are prescribed right away for instant relief.  Instead of giving me an explanation and working with me, he argued with me. he said "do you want to argue? we can sit here and argue if you want" . really?  After being assertive in the office and standing up for my rights , I FINALLY got the medicine and am doing well on it. After getting the medicine Bisk said I can't change medications later, well, i found out through several other doctors that I CAN!   2) I complained about bisk to a supervisor named "dr" Bell. Dr. Bell did not seem to care at all. The worst part is he said bisk has been working there for years and that he is a good doctor. this was a lie, according to the medical board website he has been working there for less than a year. he started on 07/30/2015 and will end his practice on 06/01/2016  3) I saw a different guy named Powell. Powell was very aggressive, and was attempting to be rude towards me. I took my notebook with me to list the questions I had, and write down the answers so i would know what to do when i got home. he said I can't take notes. I was confused and asked why? he said because it made him feel uncomfortable. I have never had a doctor say anything so ridiculous. I asked for the supervisor, who came in and clarified everything. the supervisor said it was okay for me to take notes. I asked Powell what data base he uses for his diagnosis , he told me up2date and that it is not accessible to patients , only providers. Well, guess what, THE DATA BASE CAN BE USED BY PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS. It is an open resource to everyone.  5) i called Craig Brett to complain about Powell. He is the practice administrator. so lets hope he takes it more seriously.   6) UPDATE: I asked craig to call me back, he never did. I was ignored. Later in the mail i got a letter saying that they refuse to provide me with treatment. I showed the letter to a few friends in the medical field and they say it sounds like either dimitri was caught or there is some covering up going on. My lawyer says to submit a complaint to my insurance company, complain to the med board because they have no right to deny me treatment if i did nothing wrong.   I have attended this clinic FOR YEARS , and I have NEVER had any issues . I had to change docs recently because my primary doc left the clinic. Ever since I changed docs in the clinic i have discovered how horrible this cinic REALLY is!   NOBODY in my family will go to this clinic. People i know who have gone to this clinic say the "doctors" there are clowns . STAY AWAY FROM THIS HORRIBLE  DISGUSTING PLACE!   This clinic concerns me . There is alot of lying, manipulation and covering up going on. It appears to me that because most of the doctors here are practicing doctors, they are willing to do anything to get ahead , even if it means being immoral . The supervisors are very unreliable. This clinic appears to be taking advantage of ahcccs patients .
1 Completely unacceptable care. I very obviously had strep throat. We called ahead to verify that they could do a strep test, and they said they could. When we got there about five minutes later, the physician's assistant said they couldn't do it. "We don't do strep tests," he said. Really? Then why did you say you did five minutes prior?  When I told the medical assistant that I had a steady fever for 24 hours over 100 degrees, peaking at 105, she rolled her eyes, and was like, "so?" Um, okay.   Also, when I never got to see an actual doctor, just a physician's assistant. When he first came into the exam room, he said, "I'm looking for Marlissa." I said that wasn't my name, he bumbled around for a bit and then came back a few minutes later. I should mention that Marlissa is the name of one of my prescriptions. This guy DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO READ A MEDICAL CHART.   Another thing- when he was doing my exam, he put the ear probe into my both of my ears and then pulled it out and tried to put it INTO MY NOSE without changing the hygienic cover. I am seriously doubting that this guy was an actual physicians assistant or that he even has any training in healthcare. YOU DON'T STICK THINGS IN MULTIPLE BODILY ORIFICES WITHOUT CHANGING THE STERILE GUARD. When I resisted, he got nasty and said, "What? It's all part of the same system."  When telling me what kind of over the counter meds to take, he kept mentioning things I could take for my cough. I directly told him no less that five times that a cough was not part of my symptoms.   If you want to see an actual physician, do not go to this location. I got the very real impression that the office assistants, "PA," and other staff are not interested in actually seeing patients.
5 My fiancé and I are new to Vegas and new to this office. My fiancé saw Dr Ganesan last week who he says was very attentive, asked really great questions, really listened to the issues at hand, helped with appropriate referrals, and provided an excellent overall visit.   Today, I saw Dr Lao who was refreshing, sweet, and very thorough. She worked with another doctor to find a new medication to try for my migraines. And trust me, after 16 years of migraines, I THOUGHT I HAD HEARD IT ALL. I really appreciated how much time she took to listen and find the best answer she could. She also made excellent referrals, provided necessary prescriptions, and asked to follow up with me in 4 weeks.   Honestly speaking, I wasn't super excited to be in a "teaching" environment but my mind was totally changed. It was really cool to see all of the doctors working together as a team to come up with innovative new ways to help! As they say, two brains are better than one! We love Dr Ganesan and Dr Lao and look forward to seeing them in the future!
5 I threw out my back during a trip to Toronto for work. One of my friends recommended Dr. Joy. I made an appointment with him and he fit me in a few hours later. Dr. Joy not only treated my physical symptoms but also provided a plan for a better lifestyle and growth. Prevention is key! I would definitely recommend Dr. Joy!
1 Not ever going there again! They took over an hour to get us checked in when there wasn't a single person in there. Then proceeded to tell us nothing was wrong with our daughter when clearly...there was!
1 LISTEN TO THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS. This place is horrible. I have been waiting for two hours for my mom to get fluids because she hasn't kept anything down (on top of more serious conditions). Her condition worsened this entire wait. We left to go to seek treatment elsewhere. And do you think she was even seen? Nope. Do you think they busy? Not at all. The place was a ghost town. The one other family we saw here left to go to a different urgent care because of the wait. I was "that" patient and poked my head out to ask questions and each time, the doctor, nurse and trainer were all just sitting around chatting casually. STAY AWAY! There's absolutely nothing "urgent" about this "Urgent Care."  They claimed that their slowness was due to a change in their system but a change in charting is different than a change in care. You can still assess a patient in need without a computer or sent them to somewhere they can be treated before they get worse. Making someone who is ill wait for more than two hours is just cruel.  We ended up going to Dignity on Power. My mom was seen by the doctor, put on fluids, and given the proper medication to stop the vomiting within half an hour. *30 minutes, people*
5 Well rounded gym with knowledgeable staff and trainers. with training that's not boring and training that is intense for any fitness level its one of the best gyms out there by far.
5 I have gone to Gilbert Physical Medicine for over 10 years. They have expanded now offering comprehensive natural care. I have no doubt it is the best. I love them!
1 I've been waiting for over an hour and a half to meet with my PCP. What's the point of making an appointment?!
2 Full disclosure, we've been here about 5 times in the last few months for our son.  Most of the time you are seen quickly, but one time I was there for over 3 hours and spent maybe 2 min with the dr.  We had/have high hopes for this place as it is very nice and clean and close to home.    Dr Trinidad has always been great, very good bedside manner, listens to concerns, is informative, etc.    Today's experience has essentially ruined this facility for our family though.  We saw Dr. Thompson.  This isn't our first experience with her.  The first time we just figured she was having a rough day and tried to forget about the experience.  Today we did get in quickly, but that didn't matter much.  She seems to have a hard time listening, even when she asks you questions.  This is referenced in the review for this location that is "not recommended."  She really needs to work on her bedside manner or lack thereof.  When you are dealing with children at least please try to be nice.  Remember, we are paying for your service and advice, please try to act like you care.  Also, after she walked out, we didn't see her again which was very strange.  Only thing we got after that was the nurse telling us our prescription has been sent to our pharmacy.  Didn't tell us what it was.  Didn't tell us what pharmacy.  Essentially just left us trying to figure it out on our own.    In summary, if you can get Dr. Trinidad, your're golden.  Otherwise, good luck.
5 I love Jackson physical therapy.    From the first time I started with them the staff has been patient and very attentive to my specific situation.  I switched to Jackson after another therapy facility did not fit my needs and expectations.   I'm now on a better road to recovery and I am thankful for the Jackson physical therapy team.
5 Love this office !! From the moment I walked in I couldn't believe how friendly ,quick and efficient everyone was. Front office had me check in, sign a few papers and pay within 5 mins without the annoying going to sit down , get called back up , then sit back down I've experienced at other offices. I was called back early & Dr. Heidi Banister saw me within minutes of getting called back. She was very friendly & listened to all my concerns. She has a great personality! This was my first time coming here so feeling comfortable and even joking around with her was something I really liked. Their office called in my prescription for me which I thought was sweet (normally I have to go to the pharmacy and bring it in myself). Their office also has a lab so I was able to get blood work done right away . I highly recommend this office and Dr.Banister to everyone !
5 I recently relocated from Michigan and needed to get established with a primary care physician. I saw Dr Waltman and he was very kind and he listened to my history, refilled prescriptions and scheduled me to return in 6 weeks giving enough time to receive my medical records from Michigan. Everyone in the office were extremely friendly.
1 I chose Dr. Alan Hamilton blindly to be my PCP and I soon came to regret that decision. First, he comes into work and into the patient's rooms in golf clothes, and not in a white lab coat. Am I interrupting a golf game? He seemed vaguely interested in why I came in that day to see him (a check-up), and when I tell him that I have a chronic condition and need advice about it he never says a word about it. I leave, a bit unsatisfied, but I don't expect much from doctors these days anyway, so I forget it. I made another appointment a few months later for a referral to a physical therapist, which he gave...a terrible referral by the way! The P.T. was never there, not on-site, and he had a college student (studying to become a P.T.) doing exercises with the patients, and this college student could not even speak a full sentence to the patients (patients would ask how to do an exercise properly or for how long, tell him if it hurt, etc., and the student just grumbled something...very unclear). I never went back to his friend and his referral. However, I returned to Dr. Hamilton's office for another appointment after another month or so...and I saw a Practitioner, Stephanie, who was incredibly professional and thorough with our appointment. I asked her about my chronic condition, and she went outside the room to ask Dr. Hamilton about it, and he said rather loudly "Oh, I think I remember that girl mentioning something about that." I was horrified. I asked him for help with it three different times and he NEVER gave me advice or helped me find a specialist; further, he was blatantly dismissive and negligent with me and my condition. Adding insult to injury, the medical receptionists in the front office are incredibly rude, inept at communicating with patients in a professional manner, let alone being considerate. They do not even make eye contact with patients. Bizarre. Therefore, I changed my Primary Care Provider immediately and truly wish to discourage any other patient who is seeking a PCP to ever see him. If you are not sick, or need an opinion from him, or expect a professional...then you'll be fine. But if you want to see an actual doctor who takes his job seriously, listens and tries to help assist his patients find solutions for their ailments, and even has a helpful and professional front office then you should not see this guy. I spent a good half-hour in tears because of my frustration in dealing with his staff my last and final visit. He was a total waste of my time and energy. He is a part of Health Net by the way...
5 I worked with Jesse Elis there. The PT is the best around hands down. They handle all cases and work with you one on one. That kind of attention is what made my process enjoyable and worth it. I was in a car wreck that damaged my neck and back and Jesse was very informative, in-tune, and did everything I needed to get back to normal. The only place I would recommend!
1 Bad experience with the front desk. If you can get through them the therapists are wonderful! Brash, arrogant early twenty-somethings are the gatekeepers. They should be replaced with more professional individuals who can better represent the facility.
4 Review for the Midwestern University (MWU) Dental Institute.  At a time when dental insurance is a luxury, MWU DI offers affordable and quality care for many who need dental care.  At the MWU DI, patients have access to comprehensive dental care from routine cleanings and restorations to specialists in endodontics, prosthodontics, periodontics, orthodontics, oral surgery, oral pathology, radiology and pediatrics.  How does it work?  A patient can call in to make a free screening appointment to see if he or she would be a good patient for teaching.  After the patient is accepted, student dentists (a 3rd + 4th year dental student pair) begin a comprehensive exam (digital x-rays, impressions/models, perio charting, med history, and exams inside your mouth and around your head/neck) under the supervision of licensed dentists/dental faculty.  Subsequent appointments will then fulfill the patient's chief concerns and other needs necessary to restore his or her oral health.  The MWU DI's facility is state of the art, and prices are truly affordable.  Clinic faculty members are very experienced and student dentists are able to provide quality care, but be prepared to block off 2-3hrs off your morning or afternoon schedule for an appointment and be patient for some surgical services that may have a long wait for an appointment.    http://www.mwuclinic.com/az/di
5 I have been going to see Sue Sheedy and her team for close to 15 years. They have seen me through numerous injuries and maladies. I find them all to be caring and considerate professionals and wouldn't consider going anywhere else in Toronto for treatment.
5 OUTSTANDING experience with Dr. Katibah and staff. Professional, affordable, and convenient. I called to schedule an appointment on Wednesday morning and was scheduled a visit the very next day. Upon visiting, no waiting to see and no rush to finish, no insurance overhead either. My high deductible health insurance will only be used should I fall severely ill. Otherwise, I'm happy to spend VERY little out of pocket for a personalized experience with a readily available doctor with whom I have utmost confidence. Highly recommend Dr. Katibah.
1 I think I've been to better veterinarian clinics. To start with It took over an hour just to be called back just to sit another half hour to be seen for about two minutes. The doctor was rude rushed in and out of the room. I never did get the medication that I needed.  I got so frustrated with them that I walked out.  I don't recommend going there. There is a much nicer more professional urgent care about 5 minutes away on ironwood rd and Ocatillo rd.  This is the type of urgent care that give them a bad name.
5 Als ständiger Schreibtischtäter und Rund-um-die-Uhr-Arbeiter kenne ich Rückenschmerzen trotzdem nur vom Hörensagen. Die simple Ursache ungehemmter Leistungsfähigkeit heißt Reinhard Zintel und hält mir schon seit mehr als einem Jahrzehnt Verspannungen, Gelenkschmerzen und ähnlich Unangenehmes vom Leib und mich kerngesund - kann eine Empfehlung umfassender sein? Ausprobieren! Anrufen!
5 I've been a patient for 8 years and have never had a negative experience.  Dr. Carroll is highly competent and compassionate.  He treats problems aggressively, but he would rather keep you in optimal health.  He doesn't over-prescribe nor refer out to a specialist unless it's necessary.  His PA Barb is outstanding!  She is very compassionate and highly capable.  The staff at Renaissance has always been courteous and helpful to me.  The wait times are minimal.  I don't hesitate to recommend him to others.
5 I have had both knees replaced with complications with both surgeries. The office staff was professional and worked with my situation to schedule appointments.  My therapist,s name was Fadi and I can begin to explain what an amazing professional job he did in my long road of rehabilitation. I cannot recommend him high enough.  Anyone I know that has had surgery and needs PT, I recommend to go to Carefree Physical Therapy.
5 I came to this office before reading any reviews or researching it. I really lucked out with my experience! Upon arrival, Aimee gave me a full tour of the office. As small as that may sound, it made me feel like a valued patient already! It was very thoughtful of her to not whisk me into some room, but rather show me which rooms were for what purposes. After that, she went over a full review of injuries, pains and problems I have been having. I then met with Dr. Scharf, and he was so nice! Very easy-going and friendly! And he genuinely seems to love what he does! I plan to keep returning for treatments!
5 Started coming here 2 months ago and have lost 30 pounds in time for a family cruise.
4 I visited Concentra on Tuesday, 6/6/17, for a pre-employment physical and drug screening. No appointments were available, so I went for a walk-in around 3:45 pm. Wait time was minimal, and every staff member was very pleasant. Kari O., the professional who gave me my drug test, Hepatitis B vaccine, and blood drawing, was extraordinarily friendly and even funny. I expected this process to be boring at best and grueling at worst, but Kari O. in particular made it a positive experience. The doctor was also professional and kind. I was in and out within 1 hour.
1 Stay away. Horrible service. Small cramped waiting room that is always filled to capacity. The doctors may be good, but the wait times are way too long and the office staff is so disorganized. They are also rude and disrespectful, especially the billing manager - he has no concept of customer service and doesn't mind telling you to take your business elsewhere if you don't like the way they operate. That is exactly what I am doing!
1 After getting a wagjag for this club I was very excited to try it out.  Before being able to activate my membership I had to book a time to meet with a sales associate.  After a one hour speech he said that I could sign a form and that I would have 14 days after the wagjag expired to determine whether or not I wanted to continue at the gym.  After feeling bullied to sign the form I realized that I did not ever want to go to that gym again.  I returned my form before the contract expired and noticed I was being charged for a membership.  After several calls/emails Vince (the manager) finally agreed to see me and stated that my cancellation time was 14 days after the wagjag started not 14 days after the wagjag ended.  He said I had two choices - either pay $23.00 every two weeks or pay $480.00 to get out of my contract.  I was also asked by Andrew (sales associate) for the names of friends so that they could work out with me for 30 days.  He promised he wouldn't call them but I could use my friends as support to go to the gym.  Turns out he called the names I gave him.  I have never EVER written a yelp or complained about any company in my life.  I just really want to warn everyone so you don't make the same mistake I did.
5 One of the best PCP's I've ever had! Appreciate his dedication to patients.
1 Came in at 12:30pm as a walk in. Having called prior to coming no one answer but the machine said they take walk-in from 8-10am 1-3pm so I got there early to make sure I fill out any forms prior to make the process move along. When I got here I was greeted and accepted, told they don't take walk ins till 1:30pm but they would see what they could do. I completely understood and waited to be seen. Finally was taken in by 1:15 not bad I understand I didn't have an appointment. Came here to get checked out for a cough/cold and all that good stuff that comes with it, no voice, pain in my ear coughing phlegm. When the doctor finally came in she wanted my ear flushed. So nurse came in 10mins later do so. Doctor came back to pretty much say the nurse didn't do anything to my ear as she could still see all the  gunk in there. Nurse came back to redo my ear and finally it was clean. When the doc came back she said I was fine and she would put in for some antibiotics at my pharmacy. Ok thanks!! Being that's why I was here. Finally I walked out the door at 2:30pm!! It took an 1hr15mins to clean my ear?? A 2min process and to be told tell me I was getting a prescription put in?? Ok...fine 3:30pm called my pharmacy to check on my prescription...nothing okay... called again at 4pm nothing... at this point the pharmacy tells me to call the doctor office as my prescription should not have taken that long to go through. Called the doctor office at 4:10pm they hung up on me twice and then never answer me again on the third call. Lucky me I was on the road and dropped by with my phone still on hold thinking they must be hella busy in there being they close at 5pm. Walked in the office no patient were there (maybe they are all be seen in the back). Front desk nurse was of course apologetics and help figure out what happened... oh the prescription was never put in. Decided to check yelp while waiting for my prescription to be put in.  they have 2 stars no surprise. I let her know I would be giving them one star she said that's perfectly fine. A patient that was checking out heard me and said he was giving them 2 stars....p.s if you want to call them between 12-1pm they will not answer for reasons unknown but they are open...per their phone recording.
5 I always come back!  We all float in and out of doctors throughout our lives, usually only when we are in misery.  I can not speak highly enough of Dr. D's abilities, and his wonderful physical therapy- massouse. He is not only extremely knowledgable about approaching health, he reads his clients well. He listens to MY needs, and then listens to my body through his fingers before ever making an adjustment.  After seeing my X-rays, I know exactly what our goals are. Dr. D is seven steps of heaven ahead of the game. I highly, HIGHLY recommend your next visit to chiropractic care to come from the entire office of Platinum Medical group.  You'll be back!
5 A friend highly recommended  re-vibe so I decided to give it a try. I am so very pleased I did so. The place is spotless, smells great and is so relaxing. While laying down on fresh linens you are taken to a serene place, all the while you are shedding toxins and excess weight.  The owner is so informative and exudes a genuine concern for your well being. After asking questions and applying essential oils to any painful areas the wraps begin to heat up. I am amazed how much  perspiration. I experienced.   Stephanie checked in regularly to see how I was doing, I confess I was so comfortable I fell asleep.  I will be a regular client moving forward as I felt energized and fresh when I was done. Make sure you bring a change of clothes because this treatment WORKS!
5 My first visit to this pediatrician was great, the staff was very friendly and you can tell they keep themselves busy. This is a very busy peds office, so expect the unexpected. Dr. Tresa gave me a first time good impression of her, she is very caring, humble and friendly. My baby loved her as you can tell with her giggles and cooing talk .  Thank God for people like her, she deserves an award.  . Glad my coworker recommended this place and Dr. Tresa, after I had the worst service at the other pediatrician office.
5 Best chiropractor I've ever been to. Dr. Vogel and all of his staff are extremely knowledgeable and very helpful.
4 Finding a new doctor can be a pain. So, when I came to Family Practice Specialists I was pleasantly surprised. Each time I've gone, I've had minimal wait time - and have always been greeted with friendly receptionists and staff. I started seeing Dr. Ungar - who was friendly, comforting and extremely thorough. All things you'd want in a doctor.   I've also found that this office also several doctors on staff that also specialize in other areas, including Women's care issues.  Which will turn out to be very convenient in the future. I recommend!
1 Strike 1: I love my doctor here but I'm tired of sitting around and waiting every time that I come by.  I am currently waiting to see the results of my blood test and have been here for over 45 minutes. They took my blood pressure and heart rate then told me to wait in the waiting room.   I think that I'll be finding a new doctor soon if this keeps happening.   Strike 2: Just left the doctors office because a student Doctor asked me if I wanted a prescription refilled. I said "yes" and he said that he will send my prescription to the pharmacy. The student Doctor then left without saying anything and I sat there for 15 minutes so I thought that the appointment was over. After I got to the pharmacy my regular Doctor ran over and started yelling at me because 'I told the student Doctor to refill my prescription' and that 'I left the the room'  If there's a third strike, I'm leaving this clinic.
1 Took me two hours to get a prescription for anti-nausea meds. An hour waiting to get back to be seen. I sat in the room for thirty minutes before I walked out and asked if I'd been forgotten about (I had been, judging by the lack of work any of the chatty nurses were doing) The bathroom was worse than a truck stop (not even the public use the bathroom, I'm talking about the one in the back! Pee on the floor, unflushed toilet, clogged sink). The staff is completely unprofessional. The doctor wrote unclear instructions on my prescription and I had to call and harass them to resend the prescription. This place is awful, avoid at all costs.
1 This place is a pile of garbage. I would rather just die in my home than try to come here. Brought my handicapped friend here for severe pain and the professionalism here is epic to say the least. The hospitals here in Las Vegas are just crap. The check in nurse was ridiculous and barely made eye contact with my friend. Their "PRIVACY ACT POLICY" is a joke. Asking private medical questions where EVERYONE can hear you is the WRONG protocol to adhere to. The main male RN was condescending and rude. The waiting area looked like something out of a drug rehab facility from that TV show "Intervention".  I think it's awful when staff members are laughing and having a good time in the reception area while people are waiting roughly 5-7 hours to be seen.   WORST HOSPITAL RESTROOM I have ever been to. Worse than going to a ARCO gas station.   This is my second and last experience at this hospital. My first was for myself and that was bad enough. Never again.
5 I am amazed as to how much my neck and shoulder pain has dissipated in such a short time after becoming a patient of Dr. Steven Enriquez, Global Chiropractic Family Wellness Center. My initial consultation was textbook thorough and Doctor Steve has a gifted, caring, personal approach that we "seniors" totally value & appreciate.  Global Chiro also has one of the friendliest and professional staffs I have ever worked with. Making appointments are very easy, and my adjustments are not rushed, but completed timely. The staff also educated me on my insurance provisions to ensure what my coverage qualified me for.  What really hooked me to schedule weekly appointments with Dr. Enriquez was that Global Family Chiropractic won "Best of Tempe 2014" Award. This recognition positively validates how much better patients (in pain) can feel by experiencing holistic, advanced chiropractic techniques.
5 Always pleased with results of treatments with Dr Huang. Nice to be given exercises to do at home too. New, nice, modern decor of office and rooms, and LOVE online booking and direct billing.
1 Jerk Doctor wouldn't advise anyone in pain to go here. Besides keeping his nose in his laptop couldn't or wouldn't help me with pain in leg .As I walked away he says snarky there is no help for you.REAL  NICE DR REAL PROFFESIONAL
1 I no longer come here. I found another primary doctor that I like! He is very thorough and more attentive! Dr. Tafreshi is annoying with his ipad he uses he seems not to listen to your concerns and he scoffs at you when you mention anything natural that you might want to try. He also has interns or future doctors that follow him around and now your business. The place needs fixing in the visual sense and more structure in their organization. I went in to get a tb test done last year and to this day I have not received the results. The doc office had an issue with the lab they sent my X-ray to. For weeks I was having issues with this. I finally got a half ass report done on a prescription note for my future employer by the doctor after I showed up again to their office upset about the whole thing. I could have reported the office, Dr, and the lab but I did not. What a disgrace of an office. Too bad I used to like it not going back!
1 Forte Family practice on Cheyenne is really going down hill on taking care of there patients. When I have a about question about my prescription. I call them and I can't get ahold of them or if I do they say they will call me back but they never do. Why do I have to wait for my prescription and spend money on them and they don't help me out. I don't recommend Forte Family Practice if you want to wait for hours or days for a phone call
1 If i could give zero stars i would but the 1 star is for the staff who was nice. I went to get a full work up (new pcp) and referrals. I saw the nurse practitioner because the Dr. Wasn't in. This lady was extremely rude she stated the 1st visit is a meet and greet (im not looking for a friend i need medical attention)  the 2nd visit would be when they would do labs and a physical and the 3rd visit is when they give results and do referrals. So technically she wanted me to come 3 diff times and charge me 3 diff times. I asked if im already here why cant you do my labs and physical she repeated this visit is just a meet and greet...then she asked me if i was in the medical field because i was wearing scrubs.., i mentioned i was a student nurse and a CVT, She said then i should know how this works and she said she was a Dr. In the Philippines...trying to compare professional status which i didnt und the purpose of that. She had an attitude and didnt help at all. Will never come here again. Dont recommend to anyone
5 Awesome caring and knowledgeable staff! Great sports focused environment. They work hard to keep their patients engaged in their PT and thrive to get long-term improvement. They have extensive knowledge of Public Safety and understand their job related issues and how to minimize them. Amy and Chad keep the fun in PT!  Highly recommend for any injury and prevention!
5 I had a slip on the ice and my shoulder was wonk and uncomfortable. I came here to get some relief and I am sure glad I came here. Recommended by a colleague, I was so happy first of all that I was able to quickly make an appointment by contacting them via their form on their website. Within 24 hours they had responded with some appointment options that I quickly locked in.   I arrived 10 minutes early, filled a two page form and they were able to process payment through my drug card so it went straight to my extended health benefits without any work on my part!   Their offices are clean, modern and professional.  I was seen by Sarah who is simply amazing. I must admit I was a bit skeptical of the whole physiotherapy thing but Sarah is like a mechanic for humans! She was very thorough, patient and detailed in listening and asking me about what happened and how I felt. Then she took me through some exercises to find the range of motion I had and what triggered discomfort. She had a hypothesis on what was wrong and validated it through more testing. Afterwards she uses a model of a shoulder joint to show me what she suspected was happening. I left with homework and follow-up appointments but most importantly I felt better and hopeful that with her help this will not become a long term ailment.   If all that is not great enough, they email you appointment reminders!!!  Many thanks, to Sarah and her rockin crew!
4 She is one of a few female civil surgeons in Phoenix area designated by USCIS for the medical examination.  I ended up calling every single female surgeon on the list and found out 1) did not speak English, 2) was no longer available but her husband (also a designated surgeon) was, 3) wanted my original vaccine record translated by a certified translator and I did not have time for that.  Then I finally reached Pacific Family Medicine.  Carmen, the Receptionist is extremely knowledgable and helpful.  On the day of examination, I paid 250 USD upfront, after a 10 min wait in the waiting room, a nurse came to pick me up for a TDaP shot.  After 20 mins of waiting in the  patient's room, Dr. Barredejo showed up and conducted a very swift exam.  I have read somewhere online that this medical examination requires you to take your panties off...  Well, that did not happen here.   We had a little bit of laugh in the patient's room, but her joke may not be universally accepted or appreciated, so I give one star less.  But if you are looking for a quick and easy medical check-up for your Permanent Residency application, I recommend this place.  Whether I'd go back to them when I become sick is another story...  I probably would not.
5 Dr. Wyse is one of the most caring doctors I have ever had.  He takes the time to listen vs. just writing on a notepad.  Dr. Wyse follows up with you very quickly and actually cares. He also goes over treatment options with you and explains options so you understand everything.  I feel very lucky to have him as my doctor.  I also want to note that Carmen his Nurse/P.A. Is wonderful and give the same quality service as Dr. Wyse.
1 This place is horrible!! My mom was here for 7 days! When she was discharged they did not give her back her meds for her high blood pressure...the second day home you told me she need her medicine...I called the nurses station and was told "they were not in the med room, and we don't know where they are.  And I don't know what to tell you!" Please don't take you loved ones to this he'll hole!
5 The first time I heard of this place, I thought it was a gym with trainers trying to get me to sign up for a membership. Don't get this place confused like I did, it really is a health clinic. I come here for all my "sports" injuries - well let's just say I'm getting old and the body just can't keep up with this young heart. In the past, I never would have gone to see a chiropractor but was recommended by a friend. Now, this would be my first choice for any "sports" injuries. My wife is a patient here from my recommendation and she has recommended it to her friends and colleagues. All of which have given the thumbs up to this place.  The clinic was a little difficult to find before they did their renovations but now it's very hard to miss, just look for the red store with flashy flat screen TV's. The receptionist and staff are very helpful and friendly; and their waiting room is open and spacious. They even have iPads available by your seat if you're early for your appointment. The one thing that I do appreciate is that they are very punctual and I have never had to wait for a scheduled appointment.  Majority of the time I see my chiropractor doctor, Dr. Lee. I have also seen a orthopedic doctor recommended by him. They both were top notch and very professional. I have never felt rushed or felt like there was an urgency to get to their next patient. They take their time to really get down to what the problems are and very thorough with explaining what treatments/ options are required for recovery. The treatments have been very helpful and their recommendations to avoid injuries have saved me a lot of unnecessary visits to their clinic. They genuinely want you to get better and never want to see you there again. It feels nice to know that not everything is about money. Although they took it anyways.. with a smile on their faces!! :-)  One of my highest ratings. Highly recommend. Enjoy.
5 I've been going to rehab facilities off and on for years. With little physical improvement; until I went to Rehab Plus Ahawatukee. Rehab Plus is an excellent facility with every piece of exercise equipment imaginable from tread mills, boxing, pull sleds, hurdles and tire pounding. Rehab Plus has body rehabilitation PT, as well gym patrons. Owner Keith Pritchette (PT, DPT) is very well trained with all aspects of the body's muscles, joints and their repair. Keith has a staff  that works together as a team with excellent attitudes and results. The staff makes you feel as if you are part of the family not to mention the music is also good.   I recommend Rehab Plus Ahawatukee to anyone who is looking for PT rehabilitation or a gym to work out at.  Felling stronger.
2 I decided to finally start investing money into my teeth . So since this place is literally right next to my new apartments , i decided to see them .  The main secretary, the Asian woman, is very well spoken and informative , she answered all of my questions promptly and very quickly , and also very nice . The waiting area is spacious & very mellow / clean . The actual place they work on your teeth is very modern and clean .   I've only met Dr. Davis . & He is very nice , his assistants are also fast and prompt . You can tell they're professional and straight to the point . And that's all i want and expect from a dentist . I've gone to a couple of other offices and have been talked down to in a very condescending tone and instead of cussing them out like i normally would i just took my business ELSEWHERE .    Price is reasonable . & I'm paying everything out of pocket .  So far so good . Will update once i'm done fixing my teeth .    UPDATE . I dont recommend bleaching with them , i just had mine done out of pocket and i have horrible burns on my lip ands skin ripping .   HOWEVER  , the fillings ands crowns i had done are pristine . NO PAYMENT PLANS IN OFFICE FOR BRACES ***
1 Inferior physio. Not the cleanest, antiquated equipment, elastic bands to hold towels in place instead of proper covers for heat packs, etc., etc. No real care taken to make sure equipment is used properly on patient to avoid injury. And no thought is taken to see if muscles need heat or ice after physical manipulation.  Rude receptionist to boot! Will not go back.
5 So far so good.  I have only been twice, but both times I got in really easily and it is a new facility so it is very clean and nice looking.  I have been searching for a new primary care because I think it is ridiculous when I can't get to my doctor for a day or two when I am sick...like I have that time to just hang around when I could get in and start getting better quicker.  Truthfully I don't have a ton of experience here, but it is definitely more promising than the other options I have tried.  Clean, professional, Dr Gazda is nice and easy to talk to, the office staff is easy to work with, and i can easily get same day appt, no complaints here.
4 I've never had to wait more than 2/3 days to get an appointment and never waited more than 25mins to be seen. The staff is always polite and accommodating and I am very please with the fact that I can get everything from my General Dr, OBGYN to Labwork taken care of all in one location and typically in less visits.
1 Honest to God I don't know how this Dr. got such a high Yelp rating because I found dealing with this Dr (who has the personality of a dying fish) dreadful.  First of all, for cash paying customers, you have to pay up front so if you get crappy service from the Doctor, which I did, you're screwed.  Secondly, he pushes for surgery (big bucks) instead of exploring other options.  I found his knowledge to be rather limited for someone who is supposed to be a specialist.  Thirdly, don't believe the marketing hype or the staff when they tell you they pride themselves on running on time and not overbooking appointments.  That was a lie.  I arrived for the first appointment of the afternoon.  The waiting room was locked and there was nowhere to sit.  When the staff opened the waiting room another woman who had been waiting in the hallway with me, also had an appointment at the same time.  How is that possible when there is only one Doctor?  I then proceeded to wait half an hour (8 patients had accumulated in the waiting room during that time) before I was seen and the Doctor made no apology for keeping me waiting.  Clearly he suffers from the same God like syndrome that so many other Las Vegas Doctors suffer from where they think their time is more valuable than the paying customers who keep them in the lifestyle they have become accustomed to.
5 I've been to many chiropractors, and none of them are as knowledgable and friendly as at Love Chiropractic! They make it affordable for you to achieve great health through chiropractic care!
1 Made an appointment with this doctor and was called to reschedule a week later came in at my appointment time and there was a note on the door saying this office is closed no phone call no nothing totally unprofessional I am so upset right now and I have never even met this doctor don't even bother if I could give this a negative star rating I would
5 PT Chris is the best!  It's only been 3 weeks and I am walking great!!! :). Next step jumping out of a plane this weekend and running by next week...oh yeah and wearing heels!   All the staff here are warm and friendly and make a difficult situation better!
4 We came here late one night for an injury.  Staff was courteous and helped us promptly.  I hope we don't have to come back but if there ever is an issue in Vegas again we'll come here.
5 I needed a primary care doc and s a w their sign near Frys.  Everyone was so nice and caring.  Their nurse practitioner really listened and gave me great care.  I would totally recommend her.  It's nice to see a doctor and the chiropractor all at the same visit.
5 First time here.  Check in was seamless.  EKG and body analysis was done by a really nice nurse.  So far so good. I met with Daryl and he was amazing.  We went through his expectations,  my inBodyTest results,  etc .
5 I'm so glad I found this clinic. I work in the path and time is important. I've seen a good number of their staff and they're smart, on time and seem to genuinely care. For one tough issue two different practitioners worked together and shared notes to get me better. The place is clean and beautiful and they offer you organic tea.
2 I liked going there while they were located in Weddington. Now it is much larger, less personable, and I much more profit oriented. This place is no longer a "family" doctor place. They now target people interested in elective work that are high-income.  Also, they are dropping all insurance providers except BCBS. So if your company is susceptible to changing insurance, stay clear.
4 Went to Jackson physical therapy for almost two years due to operations on my shoulders. Love Adam, Mercedes and Nate! You get out what you put in.  The reason I gave them 4 out of 5 has to do with their billing and them not being a in network provider.
5 When my husband hurt his back several months ago, his doctor prescribed Physical Therapy at Endurance Rehab.  After one visit, he was hooked... He loved going to PT several times a week and in due time, his back was feeling much better!  I think he was sad when he couldn't go anymore...  And when I recently started complaining of major shoulder pain and went to the doctor, she prescribed PT for me too... so now I know why Jared loved going so much.  So far, I've been three times and I already feel a difference in my shoulder.  The staff is incredibly knowledgeable and personable. I've worked with Matt, Katie, and Ben to date. Since I travel often for work, they've been great about giving me "homework" (workouts to do on my own) including printouts with images and instructions for each exercise and stretch.  Endurance Rehab treats all aspects of orthopedic injuries and specializes in the underlying elements of athletics, especially endurance sports.  (Yes, I took that info from their website, but I do see a lot of triathletes there). The equipment is state of the art.  They even have a G-Trainer anti-gravity treadmill.  I have yet to try it out but I  hope to do so soon...  I go to this location (near LGO in Arcadia) but they also have a Scottsdale location. A Mesa location is opening in October.
5 Today I had an appointment with Basil Rodrigues for a 60 minute massage. I followed Basil from his prior employer because he is so good at what he does (including being attentive).  Joanie (sp?) at check-in and out was also excellent - polite and professional without being robotic.  I'm so happy I found Basil again!!  I would highly recommend him to anyone seeking a Registered Massage Therapist ("RMT").
5 Fantastic clinic. Nice patient rooms, friendly staff, and tv in the waiting room AND patient rooms which made the experience enjoyable! Dr. Le and his staff impressed. Thanks to all
5 Brandon has to be the best Chiro in AZ.  Anyone who spends minimum of 30 minutes with each patient is not in it for the money.  He knows the body and he treats causes, not just symptoms.  You can go to anyone for a quick adjustment and a $30 copay.  But you'll be going back again and again without much improvement.  Brandon cares for his patients and works to get you to a point where you don't have to come back constantly. Sometimes he won't even adjust patients if they only need muscle soft tissue work.  And when it comes to deep tissue myofascial work, I haven't found anyone better.  I have worked in fitness and do a let a self-myofascial work (foam rolling, lacrosse ball, etc).  My body is so accustomed to it that it's hard to find something or someone that can actually dig in and get some release.  That's definitely not an issue with Brandon.    So if you have joint pain and you want to address the causes and find lasting relief, I would recommend you go see Brandon ASAP.
2 Ugh. Thankfully, I am not in Dr. Mohajer's care. Unfortunately, my brother is. He was in a car accident back in November, and is very limited. He can no longer work, and struggles with pain every day.  My brother had an appointment this morning at 930. We arrived around 915. The first waiting room we went in wasn't so full, but this waiting room wasn't the one for us. We were instructed to go down the hall where the "procedure" patients wait.  This room appeared smaller, and was packed. There was only one seat available, I let my brother have it while my daughter and I stood in the corner by the door.   To my knowledge, we have only paid medical copays with check....sooo....they have accepted a check from us before...  Today, they informed us that they are not accepting checks. Only AMEX checks, plastic or cash....interesting.  After a few minutes of waiting, a medical assistant comes out and tells us to go to the other room. I, sassily asked "For what?". Seeing as how that room just sent us over to this one! I'm guessing because of their space issue.  So, back down the hall we go.....This room filled up as well....very quickly. They had "walk the line" playing on the TV in the waiting room, but my daughter got a little rowdy, and decided to take her out in the hall. Upon walking out, I heard one of the ladies at the front desk say that the doctor was running behind today.  Ugh. How long have you known that you've been running behind...? Couldn't you have given us a phone call?  While waiting, the staff was delivered fancy coffee drinks. A staff member had a visit from a friend/family member, who she decided to greet in the waiting room with hugs and kisses. While they talked about who's mom they were picking up a trailer from at 5am.  Too bad they weren't this nice to us....I would have settled for 1/4 of the kindness.  While walking with my daughter, I hear two ladies come out talking about "rescheduling". I walked the hall with my daughter for about 45 minutes when my brother let me know that they were calling him back....so, we waited over an hour for him to be seen.  Another hour goes by, and I am retrieved by an assistant telling me that my brother is waking up, coming off of anesthesia. I walk back, and can see that other patients are in the big coush-y chairs provided behind curtains. When they pull the curtains back, my brother is stuck in some rock hard, frail looking wheel chair.   So, he's coming off anesthesia, and you leave him alone in this chair that he could topple out of...? Which he almost did, by the way. We were waiting for them to discuss his prescriptions with the doctor...he slanted funny, and almost went face first into the tile.  The nurses gave my brother some tea looking juice, and just let us sit there. They gave him an ice pack and another injection of pain medication while we were still waiting on prescriptions.  Still waiting... still waiting.....still waiting.  Finally, a girl comes back and hands us two pieces of paper. When asked what, what is does and why, she didn't give clear answers. My brother asked if he could be prescribed another medication instead of one that they gave him a script for, which was a C2.  She disappears. Comes back, still no solid answers. We wait again.   Another assistant comes back and tells us why we were given what we were given.  Uhhh, where's the doctor in all this? Shouldn't he be answering and talking to us instead of all you?  Well, I found the doctor. At around 1215, when I went to pull up my SUV to the front doors, I saw him (thanks for the picture Yelp!) car keys in hand, with a cup of tea. Nice.   The girl dropping off my brother thanks us. She tells us that they were "short staffed" today....   Oh, does that have to do with the DR running behind..?  So sad that we have to go through all this in 2 - 3 weeks again. 3 hours makes for a long morning at the doctor's office.
5 Wonderful family practice provider.  Such a breath of fresh air to find a competent provider with good hours, great location and easy access for patients.  Susan LaSala-Wood and her staff are caring compassionate and knowledgeable .  This office is beautiful but the care is exceptional.  Thank you for taking such good care of myself, my family and friends.  Highly recommended.
4 Pros: Everyone is very kind and eager to assist.  Assistant was super kind, warm, and reassuring. Best needle handler around!! :)  Cons: PA wasn't a very 'warm' person. She explained things very thoroughly but didn't go out of her way to be reassuring or accommodating with some of my concerns/requests.  I had to come back on a separate day so I could FAST for some blood work. I explained I would be late for work but could get someone to cover me if it was going to be an easy, get in/get out. The assistant was SO nice enough and even volunteered to open the office a little earlier to accommodate me, which I assured her wasnt necessary if it was as she said, "5 mins. TOPS."  I came back a few days later just as they opened. I noticed a new patient already in the lobby filling out their paperwork on the notorious clipboard. I signed in and was told it would just be a moment. As soon as I sat down, they called the other lady back.  I waited. And I waited. And waited. 20 mins. later I was called back and had a PAINLESS blood draw. The best ever, no pain, and quick!!  She apologized for the wait and said she'd call me back with results ASAP. I left the office in a hurry, already calling my work apologizing for being so late. *Here's the Constructive Criticism: Two ppl waiting, take the less than 5 min. appt. first. Get them out of the way, ESPECIALLY when their situation is such where they're late for work and you assured them you could get them in/out quickly. Take the longer appointment second so they don't feel rushed and you can spend more time with them.   Next, I didn't get mine nor my husband's blood work results back. I had to call them 2 weeks later. They told me that someone left a message on my cellphone, but  I never received it; I don't even have the call in my Call History.  As she read the results to me regarding my husband, she said the office he was referred to, was to call him to set up an appt.  But he hadn't. After reading into it further, she discovered that THEIR office was actually supposed to set up the appointment.  Seems there's some miscommunication going on.  All in all, I will stay with the office. I like the idea of a newer practice that my family can grow within. While there were some hiccups, it isn't enough to force me to go elsewhere. I know now to schedule my appointments, blood work or otherwise outside of time constraints and I will follow up with them when I feel reasonable time has gone by without them following up with me.  I hope this review helps the practice improve their process and gives patients a fair frame of reference.
5 Love this clinic!   Yes, there are a ton of clinics in the general area but this has to be my favourite. For one, it's close to home (bonus!) Secondly, the staff here are so friendly. There is one receptionist/nurse (wish I knew her name..she has curlyish hair, a bit of an accent) who is always smiling and so pleasant to deal with! The doctors have been pretty good here as well. And lastly, I am never waiting for more than 5 minutes for my walk-in!   Thank you medical team, for your great service here! ...although I hope not to see you for awhile :)
5 I was referred to Jessica by a friend and she has been so great and a blessing! Both Nate and Jessica truly care about their patients and their wellbeing! They are extremely knowledgeable, helpful and so kind! I started seeing Jessica to strengthen my pelvic floor during pregnancy, but she took an interest in all my areas of concern. Couldn't recommend Nate and Jessica enough!
5 I originally purchased a groupon for introductory services at Horizon Spine & Sport, which made it very very reasonable in cost.  This included x-rays, a consultation/adjustment, and time on the massage table.    Not shockingly my x-rays came back showing the decades of sports and texting that I had put my vertebrae through.  Dr. Hornfeld suggested their package which included 12 visits for the price of ten and would work through the different issues and complaints I was experiencing using a plan of care to both fix the problems as well as assuage the symptoms.  After only a few visits I was able to sleep through the night (impossible before) and I do not wake up with headaches caused by tension and stress in my neck and upper back.   As an aside, I had viewed chiropractor-based services in the past with some skepticism. However, the clinic here and both Doctors Hornfeld and Badger have completely changed my views on this.  I would recommend them to anyone who is experiencing neck or back discomfort from any source and have referred quite a few of my friends who have the same complaints that I had.
1 In my experience any establishment that leaves customers with a bad experience is due to the trickle down effect. This particular facility must be evaluated from the top down.   You must be a special type of person to work in these types of settings, and it can become very easy to forget why one entered the health field in the first place.   I always say, treat your patients as if they are your loved ones. Of course, without any bias. They are customers always, and not inmates. A degree of respect is always in order inmates or not.  The bedside manner of all but one doctor I met was mundane. They lack mere professionalism from simple name tags to mere introduction upon entering a patients room.  The day in and day out rituals of business should never become so drab that smiles lack of workers. The importance of communication and professionalism stems from pride within.   Prioritized work is essential for proper flow although teamwork should never be forgotten. The trickle down effect comes from above.
2 They have great and caring staff but the wait is extremely long. I've been in here twice and it has taken way too long to get the doctor to come in and see me.
5 I've been a patient of Dr Sullivans for nearly 4 yrs after moving to Scottsdale. His staff is always friendly and professional. His office is neat and clean.  Dr Sullivan is friendly, professional and so so easy to talk to. Yes the initial meeting with him, he appears stand offish but once he gets to know you, you will laugh and can chit chat with him about anything. Puts you at ease EVERYTIME. I love that he makes the time to talk with me about new meds, he does his homework.. He's into health and would rather see you do terrific diet and nutrition than pop a pill. But he won't sacrifice your health by denying you a pill if you need it. I even had his medical assistant remark the last time I was in--how it has been awhile. Well, I'm healthy! Thanks Dr! I've had problems with referrals to, but they are not the doctors fault but my insurance. He put all referrals in within 24 hrs of the request and my insurance messed up and never called me. You won't regret having Dr Sullivan for your doctor. He's awesome. Just look at the reviews
5 GO HERE! I'm so happy and relieved to have found this place and these great people when so many other places in the area are awful, I was near giving uo  Amazing doctors, nurses, staff- everyone. Go here; you won't regret it. Read on for more detailed praise, but that's really all you need to know.  More detailed review- I switched to this place after my previous doctor's office became terrible. (Mydrnow- see review via my profile.) I did so partly due to a bad review complaining about a 20-odd minute wait time; this was the best I felt I could hope for.  Wait time: next to none I was called in within 5 minutes of my appointment time. I was with the nurse doing questions and vitals- and then was alone for all for 30 seconds waiting on my doctor- I waited about 10 minutes at the end of that appointment but I believe that was as they were arranging for tests; though frankly 10 minutes is great, in my opinion, even for scripts.  Tests: they could do SO much on-site. Really awesome. I needed blood, ultrasound, x-ray, hba1c and some other stuff. The only thing they don't seem to have is an MRI, which I never would have expected anyway. I'm really impressed.  Doctor: I saw Dr Christina Belle- she was patient though as a first visit I had a LOT to run through. She was kind, caring, didn't rush me, professional but also laid back enough that I didn't feel all awkward and rigid. She was warm, and just really great all around. She genuinely seemed to care about my condition and the abhorrent quality of "care" I've been under recently. I have no reason to think any other doctor here would be different as all staff I dealt with were great :-)  Nurse: Michelle did my vitals and new patient stuff- she was lovely too, professional, warm, fast without rushing- just great. Also very caring from what I could tell, and didn't get annoyed with me for stepping out for a cig between tests- which would have been justified I suppose, but it's certainly appreciated that she was understanding.  Blood tech: sorry I didn't get your name, but you were awesome. My veins aren't good, and you got it first go and just really did a great job. That happens less than 10% of the time for me, so really, really nice for a change to limit that stabbing lol. Thank you, and apologies, I know you gave me your name but with so many people today I forgot. Either way, you did an amazing job, better than many labs I've gone to directly in the past.  Ultrasound tech: Sandra- once again, lovely- just lovely. Warm, kind, polite and patient without being rigid, helped me with two annoying necklaces that had to come off with patience and care, and chatted with me being very aware and considerate with the fact that I couldn't reply, as she was doing my neck.  X-ray tech: Erica- really great, just like the others, but for this I had to stand for a while and that was hard as I use an insulin pump, and had an issue overnight, before my appointment; my sugars were off and I was just a bit shaky and my legs were cramping a bit- she was very patient with me, got me water, and was just very nice about it even though I know it made her job more difficult, especially with a large number to do.  Desk staff: I wish I'd gotten the names of the two women to help me, but I didn't. They were just as lovely as everyone else I dealt with today.   The whole experience was great; I was there for just under 4 hours, which as an new patient getting a ton of overdue tests and discussing my issues with a new doctor, is amazing. I didn't wait long for anything at all, and to get so much done in one place was just great- my former doctor I would be in the office anywhere from 3-5 hours just to get regular refills, nothing special at all.  I can't say enough good things, honestly- and even if I wanted to find a criticism, I would have a really hard time. Everyone I dealt with was the kind of person you hope for at a doctor's office, but feel very lucky to find even one- to find 7/7 has never happened to me, anywhere- and I've had medical issues my whole life. I really hope this review helps someone decide to go here- you won't find anywhere better, and I highly doubt you'll ever find anywhere even half as good.
5 Love this place! I heard about Dr. Matt from some friends at my gym, and I couldn't be happier. The office is laid-back and the staff is extremely friendly and attentive. Dr. Matt and the PT team offer personalized advice each session that leaves me feeling like a new person! My workout recovery has gotten better and I am sleeping and mobilizing better than ever. Literally the only bummer about this place is that they are closed on Tuesdays, which can make it tough to schedule weekly appointments. Otherwise, they are extremely flexible and accommodating. Highly recommend.
1 I liked the doctor, but the office staff is rude and condescending. I arrived for one appointment that I had made online through their website--and was told my appointment wasn't until the following day. When I said I had confirmation, the receptionist looked at the message on my phone, then took my phone to show the doctor! Really?!?!? Why should I have to Prove I was right??? Then we get a letter from the dr's office, saying we owed a bill from Nov 2015. We paid,because the letter threatened collections (it was the first we'd seen of this issue). We did some research and discovered we Had paid the bill. Insurance had finally gotten it put through in Feb 2016 and we immediately paid. When I called the office, Rosa said it had "been too long" to refund the second payment. I told her I could still dispute it with my CC company. She put me on hold, then came back and said no, don't dispute it. She said they would mail the check that weekend (it was Wednesday). I asked her to refund the card, which she Supposedly did. I also asked her to send email confirmation of the refund. That never arrived. When the refund failed to show at our bank after about a week, we called and disputed the charge and had it reversed. DO NOT TRUST THESE PEOPLE
5 Dr. Patel is a great Doctor... one of the most thorough that I have ever been to. He's also very convenient and practical with his scheduling, diagnoses, and treatments.
1 This place is the poster child for how not to run a medical office. I found a doctor that had great reviews and called to make an appointment with him. After I waited on hold ten minutes someone answered and I told them I wanted to make an appointment for that doctor. They took all my information and then informed me he no longer worked there but they were scheduling me with "____" (don't remember the name).  Hmmmmmmm okay, thanks for telling me he didn't work there after you took all my information. Oh also, thanks for asking if I wanted to be scheduled with a different doctor instead of assuming. I just said okay and hung up to do my research. Luckily the doctor she scheduled me with had just as good of ratings, so I went to see him.   The doctor was great and full of knowledge. However anytime you needed to call there was a minimum wait time of 10 min, and I had multiple incidents were the front desk staff did not communicate information to the MA or doctor like they said they would. When I actually saw the doctor and mentioned that I had not heard back you could tell by his face that he did not get the message, and was very frustrated over it. Since my issues could cause a need for him to get a message right away he had to give me his cell phone number and his assistants number. How sad is that, he can't even trust the front desk to forward a message.   After a year of seeing him I get a call that he no longer works there and they needed to schedule me with his replacement (looks like they're running the good doctors out to me). I had no choice but to say yes and go see his replacement. His replacement was horrible and after a year of being a patient treated me like I was a drug addict and was very rude.   I complained to the "patient care manager", who said she would file it as a formal complaint and gave what seemed like the most unsympathetic apology on the planet. I asked for my medical records so I could go to a different doctor and have all my records instead of having to go to the new doctor, have them request the records, and come back after they got the records. There was a $25 dollar fee for me to obtain my records and when I asked the patient care manager to waive that fee. I explained I wanted to have the copies available for the new doctor, I was not at fault for my old doctor leaving, and I tried to stay at the core institute but there was an already explained issue with the doctor. Again, no sympathy, just told me to have my new doctor request my records and it will be free. Well, thanks for entirely ignoring my explanation and telling me something I already knew.   After my complaint the doctor has been much nicer, so I assume even though she was extremely unsympathetic that she did file it as a formal complaint which was addressed. Now if only they could get phone wait times below ten minutes and train the front desk on how to pass on important messages they could retain doctors and patients.
5 I need to get back in and see these guys! I would recommend them to anyone. I was in a bad car accident years ago and tried everything for relief. I was ready to give up on feeling whole again when I had to go in because I was just in so much pain. I've been to other PT's and they seemed to aggravate my injuries. But the Doc here did something completely different. He used a needling technique, some very fine stretching of the nerves in my feet and legs, I didn't even know he was treating me, I just thought he was testing out where I hurt and then all the sudden he asked me to stand up and so much of my pain was gone. He taught me some things to do when I get certain pains and now I can use those to try and stay pain free. I have experienced very little pain compared to what it was like when I first went in, and I regained hope that I could still live normally and do some of the things if not all that I could do before.
4 I have been a patient here for two years.  I went to the Goodyear office and had Micro-fracture surgery on my right knee.  They since closed that office and I now go to the Sun City West office.   Compared to the other Orthopedic doctors office I went to the CORE is much better at running their office.  I have never had a scheduling problem like the other review stated.  My only complaint is it takes a while to get called back from the Doctor's Assistant to make appointments, and you need to keep calling to make sure they don't forget about you.     Bottom Line: I would recommend the CORE Institute to anyone needing orthopedic care.
2 The staff at this urgent care is extremely unprofessional and rude. They discuss patient data in front of patients and have no sense of patient confidentiality.  The only reason this place is getting 2 stars is because of the Physician Assistant, Anden. She is a saving grace. She is friendly and knowledgeable.
5 My experience with Dr. George was great.  I felt like I was really taken cared of and his staff was very friendly.
5 Wish I'd have gotten her name, but I had a horribly painful thing grow out of my hand, it was as bad as that sounds, and the lady there removed it, stitched me up and got me back to my life. Whoever that was, thank you!!!! And sorry I was a baby about it. I'll never go anywhere else!!!!!
5 Dr. Dani is fantastic. We started going to him back in 2013 for about a year and every visit was always a good experience. He was thorough and takes the time to explain things and actually tries to understand what is going on with his patients. From well checks to sick appointments, he always made us feel as like a priority. Unfortunately we had to stop going to him after a year due to insurance change but as soon as I switched insurance and found out that they accepted my insurance again, i went directly back to him. My kids enjoy him because of his friendliness. I appreciate his honestly and concerns. Would definitely recommend him.
5 I was referred to Dr. Steve by a great chiropractor and long time friend. The referral did not disappoint. The office is nice, the staff make you feel welcomed and valued as a patient and Dr Steve is an amazing Chiropractor.  This office runs like a well oiled machine. If you need chiropractic care, this is the place to go.
1 Horrible experience . Took my mom for feeling funny ended up being her blood pressure was extremely high (stroke/heart attack) level. They gave her meds to bring it down then sent her on her way. Next morning same issue so after going to Er found out she had a bad sinus infection. They were a waste of time and money. Never going there again
5 One of my friends recommended this place to me. It's very clean and the nurses are all very nice and friendly. The guy in the front desk was very helpful. Dr.Gaimaro is very good!! He was very caring and insisted if i wasn't feeling better in 5 days to come back! I was in and out in about an hour and a half. Thank you rapid care!
5 My family and I have had nothing but great experiences here. Dr Ahmed Qasimyar helped us to get to the right specialists for my sons heart problem and handled all referrals and followups wonderfully. Every visit I've had has been professional and the right course of action has been given. Id say as a family of 4, we probably have had 25 to 30 visits here in the past 6 years and have never left feeling anything but well cared for.  The hours are great too and the fact you can walk in or make an appt is even better.
5 I have been a nurse for over 25 years.  My back has had an extreme amount of wear and tear from moving patients and I have chronic back pain.  Dr Wolff and his professional team are the epitome of high standards and care in the field of medicine and pain relief today.  I have seen him 3 times in 15 years and each time have been able to achieve complete freedom from pain.  Absolutely the best care!!!
1 One star because I have to give a star. We gave this doctor a year. Dr Adams is amazing. I hate that she won't be my doctor anymore. But her staff is absolutely the worst I have ever dealt with. And this office uses refills as a money machine. You will not get any refills done without an appointment. And they won't call you to tell you that you have to make an appointment for your refill either.  The staff never call you back. Ever. The nurse is so unbelievably rude. Awful. Like rude to where I've almost cried dealing with her.  I can't imagine that Dr Adams doesn't know how bad her staff is. So she should be held accountable for her ignorance by losing patients.  And forget making an appointment. They don't even try to honor their appointment times. And they don't care either!  If this doctor ever cleans house and replaces her staff completely, I'll consider going back.
5 Cryotherapy has finally arrived in Pittsburgh! Cloud Cryotherapy is located on Smallman St in the Strip district. The owner Tom is very nice, explains the procedures quickly, and gets you in and out fast. The place is warmly decorated and offers several private changing rooms. You leave all your things except (bra and) underwear and put on cozy socks and gloves as well as a bathrobe. One you are inside the chamber (which looks like an artsy high end shower stall), you ditch the robe, you elevate on a little standing platform so your head is above the chamber, and the cold begins. Yes, it's cold in there! I was remembering last winter as Tom talked to me and I danced around a little. Tom does not leave you the whole time. 3 minutes passes quickly! I left feeling refreshed, and had good focus and little hunger the rest of the day. I am using it to burn those 500-800 calories but my sore muscles also felt better. Tony has the recommended Juka machine so beware of different equipment at any other Cryo places.
1 This company is terrible!!  They called us to schedule free massages for teacher appreciation week on May 4th and May 5th.  They just called to cancel on May 1st!!  Awful!!  The reason for the cancellation is because we are "out of their geographical location"...but YOUR company called US in the first place!!  Now we have teachers who were excited about massages that will be disappointed.  Not cool at all.  I will make sure I post on EVERY social media site that I have access to.  Based on what I've seen posted so far, I'm not surprised that they get potential customers by cold calling people anyway.  Awful experience with a very unprofessional company.  Just close down already...#overit
1 One of the worst companies I've worked for. They give poor orientation. Schedule you to see people when you told them you were unavailable then want you to write a missed visit note. No pay for paperwork time, calling physicians, etc. That is not legal. Beware of their practices!
5 Hey Randy H. Strap on your big boy pants and understand the reason they are always booked is because everyone wants to go tothem for care. They are obviously doing something right, it's men like you that are emasculating our country. By the way, you have a face made for a fist.
5 Excellent medical service. I highly recommend.  Usually service is very fast even if there is a line. Dr. Matlis is very professional, pharmacy is efficient.
1 I saw Dr. Bray for symptoms of strep throat. Got there before my appointment time which was 11:30, 30 minutes before they were supposed to close for lunch. At 11:50 I was finally called into the exam room. Dr. Bray came in for literally a minute and a half, looked at my throat and gave me antibiotics without even running any tests, saying that it doesn't look like anything but here's some pills just in case it is. He couldn't bother to actually do a test to CHECK if it was strep!! On my way out I saw people carrying trays of catered lunches. I understand if he wanted to get to the holiday party but at the expense of a patient's medical care? Extremely unprofessional and I will be requesting not to see him in the future.
5 Great first experience with Houssein.   It's easily accessible on Adelaide and church, with a clean and relaxing interior.  He graciously allowed me to use the yelp 50% deal even though I had already booked my appointment. I will be back again and would recommend him to family and friends. I received a receipt without any issues.
1 Bought a gift certificate for my wife while this business was in Burbank, then he just vacated the premises. I've attempted many times to get my money back, have been given empty promises. Have yet to receive a refund.
5 I love this doctor's office and have been coming here for over 10 years. I used to see Dr. O'Claire before she left and now see Dr. Archibeck. Dr. Archibeck is fantastic and spends a lot of time with me when I come in, doesn't mind me asking about multiple things going on and is genuine and sincere with helping me resolve health issues. Nurse Veronica is PHENOMENAL. What an amazing human being. She always has made me feel like I'm valued and treated me with respect. She has been here the entire time I have come to this practice. All of the staff is very friendly and helpful, I wish I knew more names. The $50 admin fee isn't ideal to pay however it is worth every penny with the great service I receive here.
5 C'est la que mon médecin de famille est... C'est la meilleure, toujours à l'écoute de toi. Et ça ne prend pas plus que 30 min d'attente! Mon infirmière est la meilleure! En plus de prendre ma pression elle m'écoute comme si c'était mon psy... Merci Marie eve! Pour ces années. Et aussi merci à docteur Huchet qui m'a sauvé la vie et aussi à docteur Vezina. Je vous aime
5 Auttum is an amazing therapist he helped me with pain i had from the gym i highly reccomend him hes amazing sensitive and very professional
5 Foothills is outstanding!  I highly recommend this place!!! I had knee surgery several months ago and I was in need of physical therapy.  Ted is a "miracle worker" he is an excellent therapist and knows his stuff!!!! I was not able to straighten out my leg, I was walking with a slight limp and with Ted's treatments, my leg is almost at 100%.  The front office staff are true professionals, they are courteous, kind, and show that they care about their patients.  That proves that they have great leadership, thank you Jeff, Tina and Ted for your assistance.
5 Best. Doc's Office. EVER.   My primary care doc is Dr. Mansfield and she is AMAZING.... as is her assistant. I don't know what I'd do without them. I've also been to other docs if I'm really sick and can't get in to see her, and they've all been great. The front desk staff is very friendly and quick with processing people through. You never have to wait long with an appointment and they have a streamlined process to get people through to a doc quick, but not so quick that you feel like you're just a number. They listen to what you have to say and don't just give you meds for the sake of giving you meds.... which I LOVE! These guys rock!!
5 I have been a patient of Emkiro for about 6 years and couldn't be happier. Dr. Sarah Cook is my family physician, and she has literally saved my life. After years of being sick, she was the only doctor to help diagnose me and get me healthy again. She listens to her patients, offers genuine honesty, empathy and kindness. She has gone above and beyond what any other doctor has ever done for me, and I am forever grateful.   I have even referred several friends to her, and they are overly impressed with the quality of her services.  The clinic is very clean and upscale. The staff seem friendly, and open minded, however, sometimes calling the office can be a little bit of a wait on hold. But I do understand that they are much busier now due to growing popularity.  If you are looking for a good clinic, I strongly recommend Emkiro.
1 Former customer for hydrotherapy:  This place is not professional in any way shape or form.  I do not trust that she cleans every tube and keeps things hygienic (theres a jug that she used to use for chlorophyll, and its green and the tube is gunky, and apparently now she uses ozonated water, and yet that jug is still greenish and looks like its never been cleaned...  Once there was a shit stain from another client before me on the private toilet in the room.....  She gives very general suggestions to clients and yet she's not certified to give suggestions and nutritional advice is supposed to vary from person to person as we aren't all the same! She even tries to diagnose diseases when she is not qualified to do that! She leaves the door open OFTEN while getting hydrotherapy done and once she encouraged some girl that worked there to solicit me with her aesthetic services...while i was laying on the colonic bed about to be treated!!  Last time one of her very unprofessional massage ladies practically barged into the hydro room arguing with her about needing the get paid, again, while I'm getting a private treatment !!!  She pushes too hard on intestines and sometimes it can really hurt and  irritate the colon, and my partner actually got really hurt last time we went.  Again, last time I went, she cut my session 20 minutes short without telling me, hoping I wouldn't figure it out? Because I was telling her I was feeling nauseous (which is normal if you have a sick gut), and I think she thought I might puke and didn't want to deal with it so she cut my session short and pretended like it was a full session.... I had previously asked her if we could pay by cheque next time because she wanted cash instead of debit to avoid fees on her end, and I told her it's way easier for us to pay by cheque, and she was hesitant, but I ended up convincing her, and she agreed that next time she would accept cheque from us.  Next time comes around, we offer to pay via cheque, and she lies to my face and says she never accepts cheques and that it's cash only.  At first we were like, it's cheap and gets the job done, why not? Right? No.  Heck no.  Value yourself, value your health, and spend a little more for a much, much better experience.  She's not a mean lady, but she doesn't truly care about her clients, she's a hustler, just trying to make cash money, and I'm not trying to be rude, but I had to leave an honest review and say it exactly how it is.  ***UPDATE*** I'm usually never on top of things the way I am with this, as I prefer to let karma  work itself out, but I actually want to help people avoid wasting their time and money  with crooked and dishonest people, so I feel it's my duty to speak out;   The first time I went there I mentioned to her that she had horrid reviews online as I was about  to cancel my first appointment with her for that reason, so my guess is she got a NEW website, for the SAME place, using a most likely FAKE new business address (if you google the address nothing relevant comes up on google!!!) to FOOL people into thinking she's a new hydro spot, AND to start a new "cover" since "Source de la Sante" has gone to shit on google with all the horrendous (and very honest) reviews, and she wants to press "reset".... is that fair? What do you guys think?! Which would explain that the one review this "new" place has, is a five star impeccable one, most probably plotted from her, as this person seems super sketch with no online activity except for writing this one review.  I told you guys this woman is beyond crooked.  Name of "new" business online on google:  "Hydrotherapy Montreal"  And if you check out the source de la sante website and this new one, it has the same coupons and what not, AND if you go to "contact us" section of the new one, it actually has the same address as Source de La Sante's....hmmm.....shocker.  This new added info is for all you people already avoiding Source De La Sante, and  for those who are simply looking to avoid dishonest hygienists whose license should  be revoked for so may reasons, I think that included everyone in Montreal, locals and visitors  alike.
2 This ended up not being a good fit for our family. We have a newborn and Dr. Kuty's young child was often in the room right near my baby when she was adjusting. It just made me extremely nervous and gave me a lot of anxiety. I feel that all attention should be on my child and there should be no distractions. When you are paying for a service, you shouldn't have to feel uneasy. If this type of thing doesn't bother you then maybe this would be a good fit but for me I don't want someone's child around when mine is being adjusted.
1 So, I bought a voucher on living social to take the laser course with Bellagio. Two days before the class is about to start I get a vague email stating that not only will the course be delayed but they're not sure if the june classes will start. They finish the email saying they'll refund if we paid them directly if not to contact living social. No problem, besides me rearranging my schedule to do this class and not being able to at a moments notice. The vague email ends with 'DO NOT CALL the center, email us if you want a refund'. Well excuse me, but after shelling out A LOT of money and getting my schedule royally screwed for a month I WILL call you. After about 20 of the students scheduled for the class harassed the clinic ONE of us got an email from Dr. Kim/Living social that she so kindly forwarded to the rest of us. Heres a blurb....  "Due to Board of Education threatening us to stop the class until they issue a license, we must cancel our May class. We expect to have the class as soon as they issue the license, hopefully in June.   We had a successful class in March but not in April because I am a very busy surgeon and we had too many students needing handson training. I expect to receive the license by end of May unless competing laser school hinder our efforts."  They advertised as a certified school, thats why I shelled out the money in the first place. Living Social has refunded my money, but this "school/clinic" will NEVER be getting any of my money due to misinformation and poor planning. I probably wouldnt be writing this review but the front office and the handful of people I communicated with werent helpful and boardered on rude. I'll happily spend more money in the long run going to a laser school that isn't shady.
1 If it weren't for the fact that this place is just down the street from my house, I wouldn't bother going.  Appointments are a joke here. I had an appointment with a doctor who left before seeing me.  I ended up seeing a PA 2.5 hours after my appointment time.  At this very moment I am waiting to see that same PA and my appointment time was over an hour ago. I am in one of rooms finally, yet I still have 2 people ahead of me. Seriously? Oh, and I can clearly hear the conversation in the room next to me.  I really need to find another doctor even if it means driving out to Boulder City since I am pretty sure I would have been there and back by now.
1 First off Dr. Dicke is a great doctor.  I see him about once a year for some type of sports injury and he knows what he's talking about.  I give one star because of the office staff.  I recently called in to schedule an appointment to have a biometric screening done.  My work requires one for my health insurance plan and I needed to have it done within 2 weeks.  The receptionist asked which Dr. I was calling for, I said Dr. Dicke, and she said that the earliest he could get me in would be 2 weeks out.  I asked if that was because it was a well visit, she said no, that it was because Dr. Dicke was going to be on vacation for a week.  I said, that was fine because I just needed a couple of quick stats filled out on my form, so I could see the other Dr. in the office.  She said that I was not allowed to see the other Dr. I again reiterated that I just needed the screening so I was ok if it wasn't my normal Dr. She again said that I couldn't see the other Dr. unless I got special permission from Dr. Dicke's assistant. I said, ok, let me talk to her.  She then transferred the call to the assistant's voicemail.  I hung up and called the receptionist back and told her that all I got was the VM.  She said, yeah you have to leave her a message and she'll call you back in a day or two. I again tried to reiterate that I just needed a very quick appointment, any doctor or assistant would do because it's just a biometric screening, she continued to say that I had to get special permission to see the other Dr.  This was terrible customer service and could have very easily been a non issue.  I should be allowed to see whatever Dr. I want to see, especially for something as easy as a biometric screening.
4 I have received massage therapy a couple of times at Relax Rehab and have been quite satisfied with the service and experience!   They are located at Promenade Mall inside the TNT supermarket. Don't let this weird you out; this spot is busy! They offer a range of services, including acupuncture, physio, chiropractor, osteopathy and even facials. The massage therapist and Acupuncturist are RMT-certified and they do give you insurance slips. The best part is that the massages are QUITE vigorous/deep tissue and they've really helped me alleviate stress-related aches and pains. The prices are quite reasonable as well and their tea is delicious.
1 The absolute worst physical therapy experience I've ever encountered.  I went in with a sciatic nerve issue and there was no plan made to control the pain, I was given the basic run of exercises that are generally given to everyone with lower extremity injuries. I asked on my third visit would there a pain management regimen started and was told that they were still working on one.  A week later I re aggravated the nerve and was in excruciating pain, I went back to see if they could do something to control the pain and a was told to stretch it out on my own. No stem, no ultra sound nothing and to top it off after I decided to find another therapist after that last visit I was billed for additional treatment that I never received all the while my insurance deductible was met and co pays were completely paid.  Doesn't deserve a half star.  I would not recommend this facility if it were the last one in Vegas.
5 There are two locations located in the city : Southwest and Henderson. I had treated at the Henderson office, off of Horizon Ridge Pkwy and Eastern.  Having to work in a doctor's office, I've observed other physical therapy places (i.e. how they answer phones, answer our questions, handle our patients, etc) and I don't think anyone can compare to the quality of care Tim Soder Physical Therapy offers and provides.  Being treated for a recent MVA, I've felt comfortable, professionalism and sincerity from ALL the staff!  The athletic trainers / techs are helpful throughout the therapeutic exercises. They stick with the individuals until they feel they can exercise on their own. They take their time in showing each step or exercise and are very careful with each individuals' capabilities.   The therapists are also so great! They provide treatment with comfort and relief. They also show their vast knowledge in the human body and what treatments they are doing.   The front desk, trainers, techs and therapists are all so friendly, caring and funny! I can't be thankful enough for the help they have provided. Physical therapy is a slow, but sure process in getting better and Tim Soder PT makes an easier place to do that.
5 I started therapy at this location 2 years ago this month and was really starting to feel and see a difference about a year ago. I had been in 2 major accidents only 6 mos apart nearly 7 years ago.Due to ignorance and finances, I did not get follow-up care after my accidents. Although I was only in my 30's, anyone could see that I was becoming crooked. I look like I have scoliosis, but without the bona fide scoliosis--just deviations in my spine.   When I first started, I really appreciated the take-home gear in addition to the multi therapy modalities: spinal manipulation ("cracking"); allergy testing; and the soft tissue work, which includes trigger point injections, massage, traction, stretches, a far-infrared Spinalator bed, and electrical stimulation.   They also have massage therapy available by appointment only.  My pain had nearly disappeared and I began to straighten out and up. In fact, I no longer have to wear wrist supports when I sleep at night and I was able to remove my heel lift from all my left shoes that I had been using for yearssss. (Thanks, Dr. Jecks!)  ......and then...........   My health insurance became of no use to me at CHS, so i quit going on a regular basis or any basis at all.   So I suggest that you call ahead and make sure your insurance will be accepted. Also, call ahead if/when your health insurance goes into Open Enrollment or if it changes due to an Qualified Life Event. This way, you can get the most from your insurance.
5 Dominic Elti at Forte Family Practice is absolutely phenomenal. He takes the time to listen to your concerns and his bedside manner is remarkable. He is treating my 15 year old son and I will be moving my two other children to be under his care. Just as I was beginning to lose hope in Forte Family Practice, I was lucky enough to make contact with Dominic and the office manager Christine. Kim in the billing department also is very helpful. I think the vast majority of the staff in this office could learn a lot from these three individuals.  It's very sad that this practice has these three great people being overshadowed by the remaining negative and unprofessional staff. This review is five star only on the three people that I have mentioned. So if you are planning on visiting Forte Family Practice, just make sure that you see the people that are worth seeing and will make a difference. They really care about your well-being and the well-being of your family.
1 Dr. Brurroff was very rude and insulted me in regards to my weight, telling me that there are starving people in Africa and to look at myself.  I have hypothyroidism and he knows this, I've tried desperately to lose weight but it's hard to work out for me, I'm 64 and I have bad hips.  I will never go back to him again, I left his office humiliated and in tears!
1 this practice at least the one on thunderbird rd is a joke. they are over crowded and over booked. that are the good points from what i have seen. while i am not a patient my 82 year old mother is. she hurt her back in Prescott and went to the er there. i brought here back to phx to see he dr at this practice. while there we asked for something for her pain which is severe enough she can not function. they flat out refused her anything except a muscle relaxer. they did a ct scan in Prescott and it showed disc damage and im sorry a muscle relaxer is not going to help that. we asked for a script for a wheelchair for her 6 days ago and for them to get her ct scan results. neither thing has happened to date. my father went into hospice yesterday so again today i asked them to give her something for pain because she is in to much pain to dress or take a shower. once again they refused and had the balls to tell me to take her to an er again for pain control. are you kidding me that is not what an er is for that is the dr job. i also don't know which type of specialist to take her to because they have not gotten or told us the results of the ct scan. so my mom cannot go see her husband who is in hospice because these dr's are to afraid to write an 82 year old woman a script. i will be taking my mom to a different dr and i hope you don't have any pain when you go there they may not help you either
5 My search for a new doctor ended in early December 2012 when I found Community Medical Clinic.  I wanted a doctor that was centrally located, could provide me with great general health care, could relate to me personally and was patient centric.  I called and was seen the next day. Not only was the office environment warm and inviting but the entire staff is very upbeat, friendly and professional.  They explained their business model of providing great affordable health care to anyone who needs care. In today's medical world I found this quite refreshing.  Mr. Moody and his team have provided my with great quality care.  He spent time to learn about me, gave me a great medical consult, and gave me flu shot on my first visit! They make my office visits uncomplicated and help me make great decisions about my health. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a new doctor.  In my opinion you're getting more than a new doctor, you're getting excellent health care.  I rarely give reviews on Yelp but wanted to share my very uplifting and positive experiences with Dr. Moody and the entire staff at Community Medical Clinic.
1 the few good doctors they had have left.  no wonder. customer service is none. Wait times much too long. rest rooms dirty the PA's don't give prescriptions The doctor talks on his cell phone personal calls during my visit, after waiting for him 25 minutes in the small room Dr. Forte needs a business manager
1 I've been here three times to see doctor Chang and every single time I've waited 45 minutes in the waiting room and another 15-20 in the doctors room.  When I had to leave an appointment because it had been an hour and I hadn't even seen her yet and had to go to work and they told me to keep in mind she is always running about 45 minutes behind.  I have never had a doctors office tell me that.  And when you finally do get to see her it's very rushed and in a hurry.  They just try to schedule as many appointments as possible to get more co-pays.
1 Was checked in last night at 6 and met by the amazing Lynn. She made me feel comfortable and got me in bed in my tiny room. But then I was forgotten about. They didn't have my meds? Wtf  Forgot totally I was here this am and sweet Lynn came in to gather my breakfast try. Whoops, they never had brought breakfast. One was hustled in with seriously cold eggs, 'white gravy' from a package and a frozen biscuit. Fake OJ! Omg. No administrator ever came in, though I was told a couple times they would. I'm here for physical therapy due to 2 new knees. But after being ignored and not even walked around the halls to keep my legs from stiffening, I went to the bathroom on my own last night.  Ditto this morning and only to find a broken empty soap dispenser to go with the lowest grade and frayed towels in the shower...   Finally after asking again, the "weekend therapy" crew came in. We walked, I'm stiff as a board! Was told to do this and that on my own???But surprised to hear that was it for today and no therapy tomorrow, so I'm going home. I'll uber myself to Banner Health Scottsdale and use their excellent PT crew.  Unfathomable the bill of goods I was sold! Stay away folks!
5 I moved to AZ and was in need of a GP. I found Dr Sullivan on Yelp and made an appointment. The office staff is great, and his nurse Crystal is awesome! Really like them! Dr Sullivan is great, I have some health issues and he is addressing them and we are both working on them. He is supportive on my weight loss issues, and gave me some pointers. I find him funny, concerned, and open to ideas. I don't understand why anyone would leave bad feedback he's a great doctor who will listen to you. He has a great sense of humor too.  I have nothing but good things to say! Happy I found him!
5 Nicole and her staff are highly qualified and trained.  I am continuously impressed with the level of care I receive. I am in the best physical condition I have been in because of Nicole. A great physical therapist!
5 Zach Chan is by far the best physiotherapist I've received treatment from. I've visited a handful of other physiotherapists but in each case their treatment plans were not very helpful. I suffer from calf tightness and back/shoulder pain from working long hours in front of a computer and visit Zach whenever I have any pain. During a session with Zach, he is able to immediately relieve any tightness and pain I have through a combination of massages, stretches and acupuncture. His knowledge on how to identify the source of pain and then how to best treat it has been life-changing. In addition, he has taught me simple but very effective stretches that I am able to perform on my own to help relieve and prevent any issues I have from recurring. Before Zach, I've had treatment from numerous healthcare practitioners including other physiotherapists, chiropractors, massage therapists, acupuncturists and medical doctors. None of these practitioners were able to effectively treat the pain I was experiencing so now I exclusively go to Zach. This is the first review I have ever written but if there is anyone that deserves a 5 star review, it is Zach.
1 Go somewhere else! Front desk girls have very nasty attitude toward patients and don't even know how to do their job as simple as scheduling appointments accurately. Average wait time 45min to 1hr.
1 This practice is a fraud.  Set up an appointment and was routed to a nurse practitioner who saw me for 10 minutes and the billed charge was over $300 of which my insurance paid part!  She wrote a prescription for a medication that I have been taking 10 years and after a refill or 2 at the pharmacy wouldn't authorize again unless I came in again.   To add insult to injury I just got my annual "administrative fee" for $50 and am being harassed by the collections department for payment.  STAY AWAY!
2 Two weeks of the same one trick pony yoga.  I don't see the point in returning here. All classes are the same with very little personal attention to people who are not doing the poses correctly.  Very cultish - if you are not part of the gang, they basically ignore you.  In two weeks I never receive a hello or an how are you doing today.   The place is often too crowded and they don't always ask that you stagger so people run into one another. Music is too loud to hear the person leading the practice.  One of the teacher was way more interested in reading his PDA than watching the class - how impersonal is that! Large dog met me with a growl at the entrance so I gave her a wide berth.  I was told the dog never does that usually yet I witnessed her reacting the same way to many others who were told the same thing I was... If you like bootcamp atmosphere where you don't matter, where what you wear seems more important than who you are, this is the place for you.   Just not for me.
3 Ive been going here for 6 months or so for myself and daughter. There are a few ok doctors and a few with typical god complex attitudes.  There's usually a very long wait.  the receptionists aren't friendly and the place is not overly clean. I wouldn't recommend this place.
1 This place sucks.  I ordered a bath chair for my mother which it turns out she did not need.  I called several times to cancel the order and no one answered the phone or called me back.  Needless to say, the chair shipped.  I finally got a hold of someone who said they are only a middleman and the manufacturer might not accept a return.  Well the return was accepted but now I have to pay the return shipment and a 20% restocking fee, when they are not even stocking anything.  Stay away and order your supplies for a more reputable company  CJ  Boston MA
3 This used to be a good practice. Recently, I was seen for an injury. When I called after my appointment to inquire further about my injury I never received a call back, despite calling twice.
4 We live nearby and get foot reflexology here regularly.  Usually if you call a little ahead they have availability.  The people are very nice and have excellent tea!  They treat you very well and we feel our business is valued.  I recommend this place.  My only caveat is that if you like music during your treatment, you need to provide it yourself.  I play off my phone or sometimes bring a mini speaker.
5 Outstanding PT and staff! I started seeing Craig at Biomechanix last summer following a very painful and activity-limiting hamstring injury.  As a long-time runner, I was anxious to improve quickly.  After a thorough evaluation, Craig identified some significant underlying strength deficiencies which had contributed to my injury.  By working on these areas, I am finally back to running 10-12 miles again, in addition to speed/track workouts. Not only has my hamstring improved, but my chronic sciatic has begun to subside, and I'm feeling stronger and faster.  Craig's approach--finding out the root cause of the problem, not just addressing a single area of pain--is really a much more comprehensive approach to injury recovery and prevention, and it works!  Highly recommend.
5 I absolutely love Corinne's work!  She knows what she's doing!  She fixed my shoulder pain that I had been living with for 3 years that progressively got worse to the point I could not lift my arm.   I had been to other therapies and my treatments had not led to any results, one session with Corinne and I regained complete mobility in my shoulder without pain!!!  I wish I had found her sooner!!!  I have recommend her to several of my family and friends and they all loved her as well!  She listens well and pays attention to details!
2 Everything in this office feels dirty. The doctor was actually SICK and just wearing a mask for our appointment. The waiting rooms smells terrible and only separates sick and well children with a glass brick partition. The equipment is all old and dated (i.e: scale, thermometer). I asked the assistant how many inches my child's head was and she didn't know the difference between centimeters and inches. Changing table in the bathroom is very high up and awkward.
1 My husband used his credit card to make a copayment on a previous visit. The charges were so outrageous my insurance did not cover everything and I was left with a balance. Three months later they decided to charge my husbands card with recurring payments. The charges were disputed because the activity looked fraudulent. They decided to charge me an additional $35 for disputing the charges. I called and spoke first with Crystal. When I could not take anymore of her attitude I asked to speak to her manager. Alexis was helpful at first but refused to review my account in reference to my recurring charge explanation. She said "The charges aren't going anywhere." and was uncooperative when I asked to speak to her supervisor. She refused to give me her supervisors name or phone number. She kept saying that I could only speak to her and there was no one else for me to speak to and no other number for me to call.  Eventually she put me on hold and then came back with a name and phone number but said that Sherry was unavailable. When I asked to speak to someone above Sherry then I was told that would be the CEO and was given a name with a PO box and department number to submit a complaint. She was belittling, condescending  and rude. There was no resolution. It's really unsettling that these places prey on people the way that they do. I did not give them permission to charge a card that was used for a copayment on a previous visit, three months after a different visit. However, they say I gave them permission when I signed the papers back in April.  UPDATE: After speaking with my insurance carrier I  paid my balance but, NOT the additional fee. Three days later, I got a call from a representative for Sherry stating that she had reviewed my account and removed the charges so that my account has a 0 balance. It's going to stay that way because I will not go back! Good customer service is not a priority to them. This experience has left an extremely bad taste in my mouth.
5 Tammy does a great job and has a lot of experience. She can concentrate on the area that is the problem and does the best job of pain relief that I have ever found in a massage.
5 Dr McConnell is a complete gem!  I went to her for some knee and shoulder issues.  She helped me diagnose the problem and we figured out it wasn't as serious as I had thought.  I'm on a good road to recovery and I owe it all to this wonderful practice.
1 The fact that Dignity Health employs nurse practitioner Heidi Baker is enough to deter me. I was a patient of Heidi's at her last workplace, and she is not only unprofessional but downright negligent. On one visit I asked her how much it would cost to have an EKG (I'm uninsured and pay fully out of pocket), and she said she would have to check with the office manager. Through the door, I could hear her tell the manager to come in and give me the price because she couldn't "go back and forth with the nickel and dime thing."       On a prior occasion, I had called the office to ask that she change my antibiotic because I was having an adverse reaction to it (I was experiencing tachycardia.) After days went by without hearing from her or the office staff, I went to the E.R. where they changed it immediately. Her medical assistant did eventually return that call (on other occasions my calls were ignored altogether), and her message was that Heidi wanted me to continue on the antibiotic. Apparently, a patient experiencing such an adverse reaction was not worth the inconvenience of spending a few seconds writing another prescription.          That wasn't the only time Heidi cost me an unnecessary E.R. visit. Many times when I called to schedule an appointment I was told she was "on vacation," and I ended up going to the E.R (for a simple infection that became complicated due to her incompetence). Oh, and I almost forgot the best part. One E.R. visit caught a potentially serious problem which Heidi failed to diagnose.
5 Dr. Julie Wu is exceptionally dedicated to your time in the examining room.  She is concern to hear your concerns; works with you as her patient and not as "a" patient.  At least that has been my experience.  She makes phone calls after hours to follow up when she has ran out of time at the practice.  She is a great contributor to our Health system.  Thank you Dr. Wu.    EPerez.
5 Coming to AMT I was very skeptical of what I would find. What I found was professional, caring and pleasant people who made painful motions bearable. Their good humor and incredible patience is incredible. Gio, Esha, Wes and Mike as well as everyone at AMT motivate me by using laughter and compassion to keep at it and try to do better. I am so glad to have found AMT.
1 Was supposed to have my new patient appointment for Ray badisha for gynecologist,  walked more like a concentra or urgent care. Did not,see doctor asked for. Staff somewhat friendly. Arrived at 7 didn't dad,called back until 745 my appointment was at 630. After blood pressure taken waited anoth30 mins for doctor, went over family history was told I would be given a referal to see a gynecologist!  Someone else's urine sample on counter, staff thought was mine! Took urine sample was told to place next to other sample not told why sample was needed! Waited another 30 mins for paperwork to leave, was not given the referal for gynecologist. Wanted me to wait in the lobby for bloodwork after already being there for over an hour and a half!
4 I've seen Keisha a few times for deep tissue massage and wow, she's really great. I can't see myself going back to the Elmwood Spa, where I used to go for massages, ever again. None of the massage therapists there have ever come close to the skill Keisha possesses. It's not a fancy place, but the quality of treatment is unsurpassable. The prices are very reasonable too -- $96.05 taxes in, for a 60 minute massage. All covered by my health insurance, which is even better ;)
5 I have been looking for a naturopathic doctor for a long time and finally found Dr. Patricia Beck! I have an adrenal gland issue and she was super helpful and extremely knowledgeable.  I did a lot of research before I saw her and wow she knows her stuff! She doesn't miss a beat. I love how she ask questions and takes her time. Bedside manners of her staff are an A++. I couldnt recommend her enough. Oh and she is in on Saturday!  For a full time working mom it doesn't get better than that!
5 Dr.kris is a very kind,dedicated,warm person he helps me to lessen the pain that I have for how many years, I can sleep better, before i always visit him every saturday but since they dont have weekends anymore he makes sure that I can still visit the clinic atleast once every second Saturday of the month, but too bad I can't make it sometimes , definitely I will recommend him to anyone and his staffs are very warm and welcoming too.
5 I highly recommend Dr. Carr.  I had a case of sciatica that was nagging me, and with just two visits my pain went away.  I was able to go back to my normal routine in no time, thanks to his capable hands!
5 He is an amazing pediatrician, very smart, has an MD and JD.  They have a very busy practice but he never makes you feel rushed.  He listens to concerns and gets along well with my would be doctor husband.
4 Actual rating; 4.5  I live nearby and thought I'd try out The Calm. I was impressed. It was a clean facility and my massage with Mike was great. I felt very relaxed afterwards, exactly what I needed. I made the mistake of booking my massage during a Jays playoff game, but Mike was kind enough to update me a few times during the massage which I greatly appreciated! I also loved the complementary Epsom salts with eucalyptus oil, that's a nice touch! My only complaint would be that I wished the massage was a bit harder or deeper, but I'm sure on my next visit if I communicate this it won't be a problem. Regardless, it definitely loosened up my muscles.  The massages are very affordable and you get your moneys worth. I will definitely be back!
4 So far I've come for 2 chiropractic treatments. Initial consultation was complimentary for first time clients - I've never done chiropractic treatments before but the doctor here made me feel at ease with his expertise. I felt immediate stiffness relief after my first adjustment hence my coming back. Very clean looking and professional. Booked 4pm and got in by 4:05 after filling out my forms. The massage room seemed very relaxing walking past it.. might come back to try that. Would recommend to anyone seeking chiropractic care.
4 I love my daughters doctor she takes her time n answers questions the only problem is it says ppl with rashes plz check in outside for the sake of the others so y do they come in and check in? I don't want my kids to get sick so what don't ppl get???? But other then that love my dr....
3 All about the $ here pay before you see anyone. They double book for appointments so you always wait! I'm here for weight loss.  If you want to see the Dr. For something different example you hurt your neck or you found a lump on your skin you must pay for a second appt. The weight loss is a totally different area. So tuff luck not really sure if they care about your over all Heath here?
3 Little known fact: All of the "Bikram Yoga ___" are independently owned and managed, so any package that you buy at any of them can only be used at that specific location.  Aaaaaand on with the review. But wait! Here is my small disclaimer: BYT is doing a big remodel this week and closing for 4 days. I have no clue what the place will look like after the remodel so this review is purely based on the current status. I will happily issue a follow-up if my experience changes post-remodel.  BYT is one of the more well-known Bikram places in the valley as it has been there for 10 years. Over the years they have increased their student-base making every class completely at capacity with new and regular students.   The studio itself is very tiny. The yoga hall is standard but their lobby and bathrooms are crammed to say the least. The bathroom area has 2 toilets, 2 showers and 2 sinks all within a tiny space. This makes it extremely hard to get in/out when other people are nearby. The cubby-hole area has 2 benches for ladies to change- yet right before/after class it becomes a mad house of people moving around, trying to fit into an area where they can change, reach for their bags or go to the toilet. The whole studio is just too damn crammed. To make matters worse, the bathroom entrance is blocked by a small desk (filled with business cards from different shops) and racks of clothes for sale.   The yoga success itself varies from teacher to teacher. Some of them are very funny and kind and keep you upbeat. Others wear tiny boxer briefs and let it all "hang out" (first time I ever regretted being in the front row). The staff behind the counter is usually very nice and they make a point to get to know all the students and keep up with their schedule and progress.   The one big problem I have with BYT is the smell. That sweaty sweaty smell that turns people off from Bikram so much. I used to assume that this would happen regardless and I would have to get used to it, but after going to several studios I've noticed that Bikram studios DON'T HAVE TO smell like swamp ass, they can actually smell like nothing. Like clean. Like a dead llama didn't just rot there. BYT definitely has a punch of a smell when you walk into the hot room, and unfortunately its also present in the locker rooms and bathrooms.  Like every other bikram place, the exercises, timing and heat don't change, so the only comparable things are the teachers, staff and studio itself. I think BYT is a great place to exercise and meet people, but they have a lot of improvements to do. I'm crossing my fingers and toes for an amazing remodel and for a positive follow-up experience on the smell and space. Good luck BYT!
5 When I moved to Arizona, I spent a fair amount of time looking for a good Osteopathic Physician because I want a doctor who considers the whole person -- one who looks at the big picture of my overall health. I like those who will consider alternative treatments and not always suggest drugs for everything. I wanted someone who would take time and really listen when I have a concern.  I have had some difficult health issues over the years and had seen many different doctors (when I lived in Washington.) It took a long while to find the ones who could really help me and get to the root of the issue, not just cover the symptom with a band-aid solution. So I know how hard it is to find a good doctor with a good support staff!  I found Dr. Butterfield and his staff in Mesa to be excellent in the way they treat the patient -- not as a number but as an individual. They don't rush you in and out as many medical offices seem to. When you call, the call is answered quickly by a real person with a good attitude. That's hard to find in medicine, in my opinion. In a world where I see so much incompetence in many workplaces, Dr. Butterfield has a staff that follows through and takes care of business -- they don't drop the ball and let you down. It seems service to the patient is actually a priority in their office!
5 My husband saw Benjamin Stover and he really took his time explaining everything and going over his medical history. My husband has seen a GP and a chiropractor and neither was able to pinpoint the problem as well as Dr. Ben did. I definitely recommend him!
5 Aya is the best therapist I have ever had! Her ability to sense what your body needs by the touch of her hands is exceptional! I have felt a sense of overall wellness with her as my massage therapist. Her shiatsu is exhilarating and your body feels so wonderful after! Her knowledge and knowing what you need to do to keep your body in sync is a rewarding experience! She's a very caring therapist that will treat your whole body and make you feel tremendous! I would not go to anyone else!
5 My son has gone to this pediatrician since birth. Dr Vu was the attending physician when my son was born and he has gone to this office since. They have took wonderful care of him from jaundice to a dog bite in the face. Karrisa shields has a great bedside manner and is his current physician. They remember everything about my son and are always so attentive to him. Every question is answered and every concern is addressed. The offices are always clean and even when busy the staff genuinely cares. The insurance can get a bit messed up or i have missed appointments due to car issues and they always are so understanding. I love this office. More importantly my son does not mind a doctors visit.
5 There aren't enough good things I can say about Dr. Tymczyna and her staff. My daughter and I have been going here for years and she is by far the best doctor I have been to in years. She's so amazing that I am able to avoid paying specialist prices and copays to take my preschool daughter to a pediatrician, cause she handles it all! If you need a primary care physician, she is IT!
5 S.O. here: Moved to the Tempe area for the winter and needed a chiropractor. Found Dr. Reed through great reviews on Yelp. I've had a fantastic experience so far - Megan and Dr. Reed are both incredibly friendly and efficient. I've been to SO many chiropractors over the years so have definitely had my share of bad experiences (painful adjustments, pressure to come in several times a week, expensive adjustments, unnecessary x-rays, rude staff). After my first couple visits I told Sam that my experience had been more of a combination of all the best things I've experienced in chiropractic, namely: Friendly staff, comfortable adjustments, very reasonable prices, massage table pre-adjustment, great communication from the Dr. with specific goals that we are working towards, and very satisfactory results. They make it very clear that they are in the business because they care about people, not dollar signs.  We are planning on returning to Phoenix and probably living in North Phoenix, but I'll be happy to make the drive to continue seeing Dr. Reed.
5 Dr. Jon Petrick and his entire staff are extremely talented, knowledgeable, and they truly exhibit a genuine concern about your wellbeing.  Each Doctor is remarkable in their own unique way. Dr. Robey and Dr. Oku have been phenomenal in treating my daughter with such care and compassion. If you want to experience effective pain relief in an amazing friendly environment come see Dr. Petrick, Dr. Robey and Dr. Oku you will not regret it, I promise!  A quote from my daughter who is 17, after her 3rd visit she came home and said to me "mom, that office is weird". So of course I asked her why she felt that way and her reply was "everyone in there is so happy and nice" so there you have it!
5 I love AFC - I suffered from migraines and back and neck pain and within two weeks I was headache free.
5 I have been seeing Dr. Jones for 18 years. He saved my life when I got a P.E. from a knee surgery. Dr. Jones and Lani took such good care of me during my time of need. They never rushed me always listened to me and gave good advice. Lani has always done a GREAT job drawing my blood for lab work as she has never left a bruise on me.  Now there is a wonderful practitioner working with him named Heather. She totally ROCKS! She listens to everything you have to say is extremely thorough and truly cares about every patient. She treats you as a person not a paycheck.  My husband and kiddos love how fast we can get in to be seen when we aren't feeling well and the kids always love seeing Lani. I recommend if your looking for a really good family practice that cares about there patients go to Generations Family Practice. Thank you Dr. Jones, Heather, & Lani!
4 I went last night with my husband after reading about it on Yelp. We were both really happy with the experience and will be going back again. It's great to have a "no frills" massage by a RMT.  Prices were great and staff was excellent. Thanks to Yelpers for their find.
5 Every review has mentioned the staff and rightfully so. Everyone from the front desk to the therapist were phenomenal. My sister is currently going through rehab for her ankle injuries and has been praising the immense progress. With each visit another member of my family seems to enjoy this place a little more. When it was my mom's turn to take my sister, she was practically falling asleep in the waiting area. It was nice of the staff to take her to a private room and sleep while my sister went through treatment. I like how lively they are. Between the two gentlemen working, they both created a lively atmosphere by teasing Diana. As an older brother, I am all about torturing my younger sibling.   The hour that she was there, she did five or six different exercises. This made her happy because she enjoyed the workout. What a gym rat.
1 Don't let few people in the waiting room fool you. Every patient's plan of care begins with at least an hour wait
5 I have been seeing Dr Alia for almost 10 years. When I started seeing him, I was covered by AHCCCS/Medicaid, which I was dropped from after a couple years. Through 6 years of being uninsured, this office kept me healthy! They were always willing to help me find the most cost-effective way to treat my chronic illness, gave samples when they could, completed all the paperwork I needed for prescription assistance programs. I now have insurance and have moved to the other side of town, but I refuse to go anywhere else. I love this staff!
2 Forte family practice has been my primary care for 3 years. I have had good and bad experiences at both locations. At this location (rainbow /trop) half of the staff is pleasant and the other half made me feel incredibly uncomfortable. I'll be looking for a new primary care physician.
1 DO NOT GO HERE! I stopped by this location after work to be treated for a persistent cough and after waiting about 40 minutes, I was seen and on my way (with no tests done) with 4 different prescriptions, including an antibiotic because the doctor didn't have a diagnosis.   That's just the beginning of my horrible experience with Concentra. Two months later, I got a bill in the mail demanding that I pay $110 within 15 days for a line item that read "SVC PRV OFFICE REG SCHEDD EVN WK." As if I'm supposed to understand what that means?  When I called their billing department, the agent couldn't give me a definitive answer as to what this was for and said it sounds like they charged me additionally for an after hours visit... Nobody had said anything to me about an after hours fee, especially $110... After trying to get answers about this policy, the agent hung up on me and I had to call back and speak to customer service, who didn't know anything about this fee.  In the end the fee was waived but unless you want to deal with a situation like mine, avoid this place all together and just go to a CVS Minute Clinic if you need an urgent care.
3 This place was ok. I came here because of the reviews but was a bit disappointed. The RMT was nice and she was good, but not good enough that I would rebook. The room is really basic and it's above the Subway at Queen st, so all you smell is bread when you go in. i was a bit thrown off by the location of this place. The room overlooks Queen and so the traffic is pretty loud. It's small and looks low budget, but clean!
5 Great very well-organized clinic with excellent physicians.
1 A scam!  I called to make an appointment, telling the receptionist I was having back pain.  She scheduled me for that day.  I went in, thinking the Dr was going to help relieve my pain, but that was not the case at all.  He did an exam and x-rays, but told me that he never treats people on the first visit.  He could tell I was in pretty good pain, but instead of helping to ease my pain, he had me see his receptionist to schedule a time when he could sit down with both me and my husband to go over his findings and begin a long term treatment plan.  The 'diagnostic' session cost $200!!!  If you are looking for someone to come up with a long term, and presumably expensive, treatment plan to treat a variety of ailments(they claim everything from diabetes to asthma and allergies), then this is the place for you, but I just wanted some relief from a severe back ache; not what I was looking for at all!! Regretting it now!
1 I was sick for 5 days, I decided to make an appointment to see the Dr. Since it was a Friday I was trying to get in, they were booked, so I was scheduled on a Saturday with Dr. Joe, not a real actual doctor, he is a PA. My husband had seen this PA about 6 months prior and said they he did not want to return based on his experience. I was a little reluctant to schedule with Joe after my husbands experience, but I needed to be seen, and it is not far from our house. I showed up Saturday for my appointment and did not have to wait barley 10 minutes to get back to the Dr. which was great! When headed back I was greeted by the most friendly nurse who was so sweet. She than proceeded to ask what was wrong and take my vitals. I did not wait long at all until I the Dr. came in and was so pleased with everything until this point and that is when.............. everything fell apart. I was not examined by the Dr. at all- instead he said I could have a number of things wrong with me, and that I should do a stool sample test. I was immediately worried because he didn't do any other testing. I was afraid I had something serious wrong, and you would think the Dr. would be concerned about that too, but he was not at all concerned. He said I should stick to a certain diet, which he ran through quicker than I could hear it and then sent me on my way with a kit for my samples. No blood testing, no other testing. If I had something more serious wrong, I could have been dead before this office will care to try and figure out. No one even told me what to expect for a response after they get the test back. I went in Monday morning to drop off the samples to the lab. I called to let the Dr. know that I dropped them off and I had asked for a call back to let me know what I do next. I called and got someone who must really hate their job as they were so completely rude to me when I asked what I should do and she didn't know what to tell me. then she transferred me to someone else who I had to explain everything too over again only to be told that it could take a couple days to get the results back and that someone would call me before the end of the day to talk to me. No one ever called. so Tuesday afternoon when I still have not heard anything, I stopped into the office. The front desk person wanted me to make another appointment and had to go get a nurse for me to talk too. When she did, she told me that I should be fine and just to wait to hear back about the tests. On Thursday I received a call saying that everything came back normal. That was it. No concern, no offer for another appointment. So when I called back to try to ask what I do, the receptionist was completely rude saying she didn't know what to tell me and that if I wanted any more information I would have to come back in for another appointment and that they would re-charge me for it. I was so furious. You would think that they would not only want to know, but strive to figure out what is wrong. Still, everyone treated me a if we were fine, but we weren't. We were sick for over a week so something had to be wrong. At the end I realized that the only thing this establishment wants is money. They truly do not care if you are sick, injured or needing care. The only thing they want you to do is make an appointment to come in a do one test at a time so they can bill your insurance, or charge you out of pocket. I am so sorry for not listening to my husband. We will never be going back to this place again and pray that everyone will be safe while in these pretenders care.
5 Dr Dave Hamilton is a professional, cannot say this enough. He has excellent remedies and sincerely cares about his patients.
5 I cannot say enough about how wonderful this place is. I was seen this morning for stitches and they took great care of me. I have really bad anxiety and everybody was so understanding and accommodating. The receptionist let me stay in my car until they had a room ready for me so that I didn't have to be around sick people in the waiting area. She called me in after about twenty minutes and I was taken directly to a room. The medical assistant was very sweet and helped ease my mind throughout the whole process, and her clinical skills were great. The Dr. was so down to earth and had great bedside manner. She walked me through everything she did. The numbing shot before the stitches was not nearly as painful as I thought it would be, and I didn't feel a thing while she stitched me up. She was seriously so smart and skilled. I checked out after being there for a little over an hour and a half with only a $25 copay. They deserve way more than five stars!!!
5 Dr. Kraig is an amazing vet.  She and her staff care very much about your pet and about you.  She is very honest and frank about what she is doing, why she is doing it and the costs involved.  As someone who has to be very mindful of money Dr. Kraig doesn't order random tests or do unnecessary extras just to make an extra buck for herself.  She wants your pet to get better and doesn't want you to have to mortgage your house because of it.  I definitely recommend Dr. Kraig to anyone who wants a caring vet and needs to be mindful of their money.  You won't be disappointed.  And my animals love her!
1 absolutely atrocious.  beyond bad.  I've had 3 appointments, each of which took 2 hours from entering the clinic to leaving, for 5 minutes face time with a doctor.  eventually I gave up and went to another doctor.  the problems weren't over though - after requesting that they send my records THREE times, they have so far sent the WRONG RECORDS twice and sent NOTHING the third time.  what a joke!
4 Great Chiropractic Practice.  Great Staff =)  My neck pain was gone in a week.
5 This was my first visit to a physical therapy office and I must say I was greeted with smiles and a pleasant receptionist. The physical therapist  Doug was very thorough and explained everything to me and answered any questions I had. I had a very pleasant first experience, even though I am sore tonight, at this office and have made my next 2 appointments. Thank you to the people who took care of me today.
5 I have been going to this office since September 2011. They are the nicest group of people and the care they provide is superb. They have changed my life. By getting me back into alignment and keeping me in alignment, I am able to do things and enjoy life so much more.
5 I tried for the longest time, to avoid seeing anyone about my back.  I was in denial and thought it would heal on it's own.  After being extremely limited to what I could do in workouts, and just in everyday life, I was referred to Landmark Physical Therapy.  From day 1, not only did my mobility increase, but I was reassured that I would be back to normal in no time.  After only a few visits, and starting to feel much better after each visit, I was released.  This was a bitter sweet moment for me.  I was extremely happy to go back to my normal active life, but sad to leave the place.  The people there - Mark, Shane, and Joe, really care about getting you back to your full potential.  I definitely recommend anyone and everyone to Landmark for even the slightest pain.  They are miracle workers!
5 I used to be a patient of Dr. Tong at Matlis Medical, but I had to move across the country.  To preface, I'm a physician myself and the switch to a new family clinic made me realize how great Matlis Medical and its physicians were.   I started off as a walk-in patient.  Even as his walk-in patient, I found Dr. Tong to be very thorough in his assessments and willing to send referrals when needed.  The wait times rarely exceeded 15 minutes with him as well.  Therefore, I decided to switch from my previous family physician to him.  I have also seen Dr. Franklin before once when I needed something urgently - and she was great as well.  I think I also started with him when he was newer to the practice so I could easily get same day appointments as well - which is crucial as my schedule is chaotic.  Overall, no complaints whatsoever - great clinic and receptionists, great physicians with good bedside manners.
4 Loved the ambiance. Loved the service. The price? It was decent, considering the service we got.   Before you go in for your scheduled spa, they make you wait in this nice all-white waiting room, they come and pour you water and chat with you.  Overall, good experience.
5 I can't even explain how happy I am that I began seeing Dr Johnson, and how quickly I already started noticing the areas we worked on getting better.  Great guy, very professional, and amazing at what he does!!
5 Alex Singh helped me with my vertigo.  He was extremely professional and very effective.
5 I could barely walk upright when I started my physical therapy. After I finished, I could not only walk with a minimum of pain, but was given the tools to continue at home. Everyone was so friendly and professional. They recommended I get a TENS unit for home, and it is so helpful. It's less than $50 via Amazon, and is worth every penny. I will definitely miss the all the staff. I don't want to forget the reception desk...they were wonderful and knew me after the first visit. Thank you so much. I was able to ride my Harley, Amy!
1 My father has been here for over 7 hours waiting for test.... We ask the staff if they would check his sugar because he hasn't eaten anything since 6am and they said that we checked it early which was around 1pm and it is now 7:30 pm abs still not check or food or anything. If you have any heart problems or chest pains dont come here because they completely forget that you are here they can care less. My dad was calling to a doctor because he is hooked up to all these machines and he needed help the doctor never even looked at him so i went to the nurses station and asked for help.... This is crazy stay away from this place they only do the bear things that are needed and if you font ask they wont say a thing or check on you see if ypur even still alive!!!! Please people dont come here!!!!!
1 Dr. Marutka is the worst Doctor I have ever had. No personality and just the most sarcastic and rude Doctor I've ever had to deal with. Very bluntly told me that one of my medications was killing people. During one visit in which I specifically asked for a referral to a dermatologist he asked what the problem was and when I explained he said "you know what I think you need" and when I asked what he said "you need to go to a dermatologist". Really? You think? No bedside manner whatsoever. In fact, I have paid cash to see my old Doctor regularly (and wait in her office for two hours) rather than go to Dr. Marutka who is covered by my insurance because I dislike him so much.
5 Just saw Dr Rosenstein at this location and WOW! I have never been so impressed with a doctor's knowledge about my (somewhat rare) condition.  Dr Rosenstein spent nearly 1 full hour with me and was clear and concise in the tests that he ordered for me.  His staff is amazing as well.   Will definitely be back.  Fantastic experience!!!
5 At first i didn't believe a chiropractor could do anything for me, three months later and I'm still coming here.  Autumn and Ashely are two very enjoyable and beautiful ladies that will keep you reminded of your appointments as well as keep you informed on all the processes that they will be doing.  Also if your ever stuck on a problem they are a great source to bounce thoughts off of.
5 I live the girls at 360!  Sooo friendly, so helpful.  They really like and care about their patients and job.  Best PT place in the South Chandler area!   They are great with anyone at any age.  I really learned a lot from them too.
5 I love my doctors.  They are so respectful.  I went in today with serious pain.  My main doctor's partner saw me, as my primary doc was out of town.  She introduced herself, asked me a lot of questions about my symptoms, examined me, and made several recommendations.  Surprisingly, one of them was to see a chiropractor for an evaluation, as the problem seemed to be with the muscles and bones of my ribcage.  Dr. Mansfield prescribed some low-key meds (ibuprofen and a muscle relaxer) and referred me to an awesome chiropractor right next door.  I got the best night's sleep in recent memory, and the pain seems to have decreased some already.  The office staff is courteous and efficient.  I hated to leave my old doctor, who I'd seen for many years, but she moved her office way out to southeast Gilbert.  Mountain View is just a few miles from my office.  I'm glad I made the change.
1 I Go to the Dr Office  Or Did  The bio identical hormone's are fine but the staff at this location is quite poor you can never reach an actual person every time I've had a pellet insertion it is been a different nurse not a actual primary care physician  The last two pellet insertion's they have hit nerves on both sides of my body there only explanation after I've spoke to not the doctor Justin office technician is you take ibuprofen and ice it I asked why should take ibuprofen for a pellet insertion She was very rude and gave me no other answered  I see Shelly Adams but at this point she does not want to do with me even though I pay $300 for pellets every three months plus office visits and bloodwork I am now found out that Des Rosa Has been overmedicated me even when  I did not need hormonal replacement they still gave them to me and it's not a nurse or the doctor that put the implant in it's an office technician beware
1 The good thing that I have to say is that they tend to dress very cute.  Other than that, like most doctors offices, there are long wait periods before getting seen. The problem that I have with this particular office is that after possibly waiting over an hour to get a check up, or follow up on something that could potentially be serious, it seems as if they don't care. Most of my experiences there, I felt as if I were a burden. They would talk to me for about 10 seconds, and try to run out of the door. All of them.   I have to make them sit down and figure things out, run tests, etc every single time. Which is not acceptable. There are things that my husband got diagnosed with years ago that they keep saying magically disappeared. Which, it didn't . It got worse because it hadn't been treated. We got a 2nd and 3rd opinion. This is how we know. Instead of going after her office, we left.  I originally picked this office because it was small, and I had done research on Dr Faylona and the results seemed nice.   I feel if you have serious ailments, symptoms, or anything that scares you health wise, you should go to a different office. I was a patient ( and was patient) for a year. And that was 1 year too long.
1 Was rescheduled twice. I work in the dental field so I know the difficulty experienced with the health field schedule. But to be rescheduled the day before both times? Really? Time to hire more associates. They get one star only because the employees manning the phones seem very friendly on the phone.
1 Head to toe was recommended to me by a friend to have my 2 year old evaluated.  A therapist came to my home and was very friendly and discussed my daughter. But nothing ever came from it.  We never received an evaluation or diagnosis. She never even sent a diagnosis to my primary care physician. Or even a bill for her coming to my home!
5 The crew at Step Up are great! Always a fantastic massage and successful chiro sessions, and very flexible if something comes up. Highly recommended!
4 Been coming here for PT on and off for the last two years and found the staff and facility to both be good.
1 I'm just coming back for a re-check on a work related injury and I make my appointment for 11am and I'm waiting over 55 minutes in the waiting room and then another half hour waiting for a doctor to re-check me.  What's the point of a damn appointment if it's not even in time.  Hell,  these guys that didn't even have an appointment were seen before me and they came in at the same time as myself.  This place is a joke.
4 Everyone up front is wonderful at the Banksville location. Dr. Johnson is very nice, I usually see Dr. Brown, who is amazing. He actually spends time, listens, and wants to help more than prescribing pills.  I didn't give them 5 stars because of the new automated calling system. My appointments have been scheduled correctly, but I don't think a message I have ever left has been given to the doctors...not cool!
1 These people are just horrible with any form of paperwork.... Dangerously horrible. Twice they have not done the proper paperwork to refill my insulin prescription, both times being despite constant reminders to fax the proper paperwork. Seriously, how many times must I ask them before they fax a single paper?! An entire month advance notice and they only send the fax the very day I run out, resulting in me having to go buy insulin on my own (I'm part of a discount insulin program, but I have to get it from the doctor who has to renew the paperwork every 3 months), costing me $150! This is just the tip of the grief these people cause me. I'm switching to a new doctor as soon as I've got insurance that will allow me. Save yourself the hassle and find someone else for your medical needs!
2 Doctor's and PA's are great, but they are ALWAYS at least an hour behind!! My time is valuable so it may be time to find another doctor after 4 years!
1 This place is a joke! Every time I have been, I have had to wait at least an hour after my appointment time. The doctor Has enough time to write you prescription and collect your money. The place seems like a scam all day! See a real doctor and avoid this spot.
1 My experience with Dr Parikh has been nothing but a nightmare first of all they lost my X-ray records. Next I'm waiting to hear from his office about a referral wich I never got Then he had the nerve to tell me he doesn't have time to listen to every thing that's wrong with me I was in shock for a Dr to say that the service was very poor it was like he was just trying to get me out of his office. This is the worst Dr that I have ever had .he seemed like he was overwhelmed because he told me I don't have time today not today he said I usually don't write bad things about people I give everybody a fair shake but this guy didn't have my health in his best interest ....
5 This is my chiropractor of choice!  Love coming here, the staff is always nice and accommodating all the time and very helpful. Have come here off and on for over 7 years and the doc is really good and understands what I need and what treatment would work best for me. If you're looking for a good back doc, this is the place to be! Totally rate this place 5 stars!
1 One of the worst experiences I have ever had.  Was talked down to. Made to feel like I was not a valued patient.  Was told that the negative reviews were patients that were not given drugs.   Said needed referral from another Doctor and once they received it, would call when they had a chance to review referral form.   That was just on the phone.  If the Office Staff is that way, how is the Doctor?
5 I recommend this urgent care. We are pretty picky and this facility is clean, staff is wonderful and you aren't waiting for what feels like a day and a half!!   Very pleased!!!!!
5 This facility has many adaptive programs that are great for kids of all ages. I love how the therapists strive to make kids comfortable and at ease at all times. It is incredibly difficult to find such a caring center that treats so many different illness from physical to emotional; all are included.  One of the things I admire about this therapy center over all others in Vegas, is their involvement in the community. While making money is great, there are very few centers that raise funds for and lend a helping hand to non profits. To all who participated from My Left Foot Children's Therapy- Thank you for doing the Buddy Walk for Southern Nevada Down Syndrome Association!   I really admire the staff, classes and organization that is My Left Foot Children's Therapy and highly recommend them for your kids!
4 I was looking for somewhere to get a deep tissue/shiatsu massage and found really good reviews on this place. They also offer couples massages and, considering that my fiancé and I were having a rough week, I decided it would be a nice treat for both of us.   I called to make an appointment on a Thursday and was able to book a couple's massage for that Sunday, which was very pleased with. I also received two text confirmations in advance of my appointment, which was a nice touch.  Zen is conveniently located in Dilworth and has plenty of parking behind the two houses they occupy. Pricing is decent considering there were two of us and it was deep tissue: $120. We were very pleased with the quality and professionalism of Zen and will definitely return!
3 When I first starting seeing Dr. Cohen, a couple years ago, I thought she  was "the one." THE doctor I've been looking for. She was patient, thorough, and listened to what I had to say.   But lately, it seems those things have tapered off a bit. I can only theorize that it is because she has such an increased patient load. My appointment times have now become just a few minutes. She just sort of flips through my file, and then sends me on my way.   On the other hand, her busy schedule has meant that now I can often only see her PA, Sally. In her, I found again all the qualities that I liked in Dr. Cohen -- patience, thoroughness, and time.
2 This doctors office is very horrible. The front desk receptionist is never even there and is always talking with the co-workers instead of assisting patients. Also, I went there to get my thyroid checked. I had an order from the doctor to get my lab work done for this and they did not even test for it! They only tested for my vitamin D level. The doctor had no idea what was going on with me when I brought up that I was having pelvic pain (this was the gynecologist). Do not go here. They do not know anything and it is a waste of time.
1 The staff was friendly and the visit was quick. Once we got the bill though, we were extremely disappointed. They charged us for things that we didn't even need and the highest medical check-up code when it was just a basic visit. We will not be going here again. Drive just another minute south to a totally different urgent care with HONEST workers.
4 This place is great. Staff is amazing. Been here a couple of times, female instructors tend to be soft spoken with loud music, Devin however is a very loud instructor and I loved her class today. And would definitely come back. They rent yoga mats and yoga mat towels so you're set.   Love it and will definitely return...
5 Amazing staff. Jim Bodine is very professional and incredibly knowledgeable. Jim has helped me recover and eliminate several injuries I've had. The atmosphere is very friendly. I definatly recommend this place.
5 I've been with them since I left my pediatric doctor and I could not be happier. Doctor Gannon is the best doctor I have ever had and every visit is informative, helpful, and he doesn't try and rush me out. He answers all my questions without charging me an arm and a leg like other doctors do. He and his assistant get my medications out quickly and it is a painless process for me. I would recommend him to ANY ONE! His staff has always been very nice to me as well.
5 Brooke was a fantastic therapist and really helped me to get my mobility back after a knee injury. She also educated me on stretching to keep from getting re-injured. All of the techs were very friendly and helpful. I looked forward to going to physical therapy and it took me about 6 weeks to feel 100% better, however after about 1 week I was seeing a huge improvement. Go Brooke and the team at Foothills!!!!!!!
5 Have been here many times, specifally for the Rehab clinic and have been extremely happy with the service.  Dr. Shafiei (the chiropractor) is very knowledgeable, friendly and has helped me so much with my chronic headaches.  I cannot recommend the services enough here.
1 I don't know if anyone is having problems with this doctor with payments. My brother was sent to a collection agency for a bill he not aware of 2 weeks after his visit.   Immediately upon getting the call from the collection agency and bring threatened he went to pay that bill.   A few weeks later, he gets a statement from his insurance indicating that they had paid the doctor.   This means that the doctor was paid by the collection agency AND the insurance.  So she was paid TWICE.  This was November 2015 and till this day, after calling the doctor's office every week, THIS HAS NOT BEEN RESOLVED.   apparently, she got paid double but DOES NOT WANT to return the money.   We even went to all the trouble if sending her proof that she was double paid.  We are aware that she no longer has the practice but WE WANT OUR MONEY BACK!!!!!!!!!
1 Really nice pleasent staff. They have free snacks and drinks by WHY WHY WHY would anyone come here for a 5 hour wait???? This is ridiculous!!!!! Awesome staff and snacks do not make up for a poor business model!!! How is this place still in business? I just don't get how a company can be so ineffective and still be around!!!! What a joke!
5 Dr. Mall and his incredible staff are the best in town, hands down! Dr. Mall is not only friendly, but truly cares about his patients and works hard to give the best quality medical care. My family and I have been going to New Image for years now! I've not only seen him when I was sick but I've gotten amazing facials and other services done in their medical spa. The office is beautiful and the staff is always helpful! The location is easy to get to as well!
1 Unbelievable. This place disgusts me. They made me wait 4 weeks to see a doctor, fast all night for blood work, fill out all the paperwork, give them allllll of my info.. To finally tell me I had some outstanding balance from 10 years ago I needed to pay!! Apparently my insurance was no longer active in 06 or 07 and they have been trying to bill me for years (to which I have never seen a bill). Just to see a doctor I asked if they could bill me.. To which the snobby billing lady replied "we've been trying to". You people make me sick. Thanks for NOT telling me before all the hassle only to try and strong arm me for money I have no recollection of instead of letting me check my Heath with a doctor. You know, what you're in business for. Disgusting.
3 The facility is elegant, sumptuously decorated and smells amazing. They manage to recreate a spa experience without charging a lot. My massage therapist was friendly and professional.  My only complaint would be that the massage felt a little perfunctory. I got the feeling that she wanted to get it over with, going through the necessary steps as fast as possible. I was her last massage of the night and she still did a good job but it did feel a little rushed.
5 We've been going to Great Destinations for 6 years now.  We love them!  My daughter and son both adore Dr. Gettleman.  We have had great experiences with the other doctors in the office too.  Highly recommended!
5 I am shocked to see even one bad review! Dr. Cain is incredible! She is an excellent doctor and truly cares about her patients. Don't hesitate to see her. We need more doctors like her!
5 If you're hurting, this is the guy you need to see!!! Dr. Chris takes the time to get to the root cause of failure, gives you an accurate diagnosis and is a consummate pro at providing treatment techniques and rehabilitative recommendations.       I work in a high intensity environment, and let's face it-- at my age I probably should be doing a lot of things a little more carefully..... So, it's really nice to know that the team at Total Lifestyle has got my back!    My personal experiences of the level of care and compassion that I received when I was injured made me a customer for life. When I overexert and pay the price, I know where to go. Words cannot convey the gratitude I have for the kindness and proficiency exhibited at TLC.
5 Termin am gleichen Tag, schnell drangekommen, alle freundlich, schnelle und zielsichere Diagnose, gleich ein Rezept, nach 1 Woche alles gut.  Was will man mehr? ;-)
1 My primary care physician left the practice last year. I had seen him at least once nearly every year for the past ten years or so. Despite this, when I scheduled my anual checkup with another member of the practice, I was told that I could not have my bloodwork for the checkup done until I was established with with the new physician. What do they did they do with all of the previous 10 years of medical records showing what tests my previous PCP had been doing? If they are going to treat me like a new patient, why bother going back???
1 I saw Dr. Janet Pragit at the Mesa/Chandler location. I had seen her a few times for random check-ups, but since I have always been extremely healthy-- I'm a normal weight, and have no medical reason to see a doctor-- I didn't really ever need to visit the doctor.   Well, one time, I came in because I was having sudden digestion and fatigue problems and I told her about my various symptoms.  Dr. Pragit, after listening to my symptoms, told me that my issue was that I was eating too many carbs. My bloating, bleeding, sudden fatigue, and other symptoms that no one wants to hear about were due to overconsumption of carbs according to her. I'm not sure how she came up with the idea that I overeat carbs (the bloodwork showed no issues other than low Vitamin D and, again, I am a healthy weight), but she was sure of it and gave me a list of foods to avoid. I wasn't satisfied with this "diagnosis", so I asked to see a specialist. She told me she wouldn't write a referral because I needed to try her diet first for at least a month. This made me furious.  I fought with my insurance and did eventually get a referral to a GI doctor without Dr. Pragit's help. When I met with the GI doctor, he was very concerned with my symptoms and he said it was unlikely that overeating carbs was the issue. After a few tests over the span of a couple months, my GI doctor found out I have Chron's Disease. If I had just pressed on with the diagnosis of "overconsumption of carbs" as Dr. Pragit suggested and followed her vague diet plan, my disease would have just further progressed.  While I appreciate Dr. Pragit's speculation of my diet habits, when a suddenly moderately active person with no history of health issues comes into your office complaining of odd, serious symptoms that are altering normal patient behavior and functioning, maybe don't tell them that they're eating the wrong foods and tell them that dieting is the solution. While dieting probably wouldn't have hurt me, there was clearly something else wrong. Healthy, active people don't suddenly feel like they have a boulder in their stomach all the time and start sleeping 12+ hours a day.  May I suggest actually trying to help them, and possibly sending them to a specialist after they specifically request one?
5 I was ailing on a Saturday. No Chiropractors would see me except Dr. Steve. He is knowledgeable, and ethical. Unlike other back docs that try and get you to come in for 3-6 visits, Dr. Steve only treats your pain and there is no pressure to return again and again. His staff is helpful and the office is clean and comfortable. Give them a try. Your back will thank you.
1 Can I give a negative star instead? Absolutely horrible!!! I was going to be a new patient. On the day of the appointment (today) I was called by her office that she was ill and they needed to cancel my appointment. First, this should have been done with more than 3 hours notice and have an immediate follow up of next available option. This was not the case! I answered sounds like you just lost a new patient. And take a guess of the professional response I got from the lady? "Thats ok" click...she hung up on me. I never ever want to be treated like this by any business. Good bye and I hope you get treated the same way wherever you go
1 I think its telling that there are numerous similar complaints that WFP responds to.  Given the number of similar complaints, clearly, there is an issue with the practices of this office as much as they try to explain and defend it.    My experience is similar to many other individuals who posted here.  I have no underlying health issues and visited Warner Family Practice for a routine annual exam.  My insurance covers routine exams at 100%.  After the visit, I received multiple charges from WFP totaling around 500.00.  I inquired with the office and they told me that these are charges my insurance did not cover.  I reached out to my insurance provider who told me they do not cover these tests as they are not part of a routine physical.    The practice ordered tests that are not part of a routine physical that I did not request and, based on my health, were not warranted.  WFP also requires a patient to come back into the office to receive test results which is an additional $175.00 office visit charge, not covered.  They require a card on file to charge automatically allowing no opportunity to question charges.    I did speak to the office manager who was patronizing and not helpful;I am also attempting to work with the Better Business Bureau.   Please be wary of this office and their practices.
1 was waiting here for a good hour.. could tell that the nurses could hear me wheezing and having trouble breathing they didn't seem to mind let alone acknowledge me. When I finally saw the doctor the service was much better.
5 I found Aveon health through my health care plan and googling doctors that specialized in diabetes. Booking my first appointment was quick and easy with an attentive and friendly front desk staff. Dr. Sam Fereidouni was quick to diagnose my back pain and making referrals to trusted spine specialists. Kim Brabentz, PA-C worked with me making timely adjustments to my medications to better manage my back pain, type II diabetes and high blood pressure in addition to helping me with some FMLA paperwork. I can see the results after just the first month my back pain is better, my blood pressure is lower and my diabetes blood sugars are lower and with less blood sugar spikes with the medication adjustments. I feel comfortable with the approach Dr. Sam Fereidouni and Kim Brabentz, PA-C in taking time to look at alternative medications, timely follow up on lab results, taking time to answer my questions, in addition to providing me ideas on next steps i can take such as drinking more water and less tea. I am back up and walking again after just month of working with Aveon Health. The patient portal and iPhone app are easy to work with to track appointments, visit records, medications, and an option to send a message to the staff. I very much appreciate the time, effort and energy the entire staff has taken to helping get back up on my two feet!
5 I can't speak for the other doctors at Nevada Family Care but Dr. Karl is wonderful. Seriously, he takes all the time you like answering questions and isn't afraid to talk to his patient and reason with him over treatment.  He solved a problem I had that three other doctors missed. One problem is that since he lets patients spend as much time as they want, there are sometimes wait times that are excessive.  I'd rather have that problem then not enough time. Also, they have a lab right there!  No outside blood work!
5 Stephanie was very professional and knowledgeable. I highly recommend her because she did an excellent job and she should be considered the Nordstrom of the industry. She should get ten stars.
5 I have suffered from back and neck problems for several years. I have a great chiropractor I go to, but I was still having problems keeping my neck in alignment. My chiropractor recommended PT to strengthen my neck and help loosen up several other vertebrae that were stuck. I had several people recommend Corey McKinnon with One Accord. It just so happens that they opened up this Gilbert location not to long ago, so I made an appointment. I knew due to the number of years I have had neck and back problems, it could take a while to see a change. I was pleasantly surprised with how quickly I am seeing results and feeling better. One of my major sources of discomfort was two vertebrae that were stubborn, and not moving. This was preventing me for several years from running, which I enjoy. Dr. McKinnon was able to get the vertebrae moving and functioning well again. I have been able to start running again pain free!!! I can tell Dr. McKinnon is very knowledgeable and experienced in his field. He takes the time to listen and understand the problems his patients are experiencing. I am extremely happy with the progress and results I am seeing.
1 I've been going to this clinic for a couple years now and have experienced terrible, disorganized service (mostly on part of the front office).    The front desk forgot to fax my MRI requisition to the hospital.. months later, when I called to inquire after not receiving an appointment, they faxed it, but to the WRONG hospital.  Another time, when I received a referral to an allergist.. the front desk forgot to send in the form.  Again, months later, after not receiving an appointment, I contacted the office and found out they never sent in the form.    In both instances they skirted around taking any blame and were completely unhelpful and unwilling to have the requests expedited.  I was lucky both cases were for minor health issues.    I have also been through two family doctors in two years since joining this clinic, as they always seem to leave.  Each instance, they have refused to reassign me to a female doctor.  Not impressed with the sloppy service and inconsistency.  Do yourself a favour, and find a better doctor's office, it's not worth the hassle and maltreatment.
4 My Doctor - I would give Laurie Michlin 100 stars if I could.  She is absolutely fantastic, and basically gave me my life back. Her assistant, Vanessa, is also wonderful!  I have never had a doctor who cares and listens the way Laurie does.  She's wonderful.    The Practice as a whole -- Some of the front desk people are great and helpful, however, some act like they are doing you a favor by talking to you and are not friendly at all (thus the less than 5 star rating.) Had an instance where a family member had to see a different doctor than usual, and we were less than thrilled with the treatment from them.
5 Excellent service, really nice staff interested in getting you as pain free as possible!
1 Worst service ever! Definitely would not recommend it to anyone. Front office staff do not know how to greet and one of the nurses was so harsh to my daughter that she fears going back into that place. Will certainly never return although must say that the only saving grace are the polite doctors.
5 Ok so where do I begin. I have a pretty serious Sciatica nerve issue going on , was referred to Dr Paige by an acupuncturist. First appt . was unbelievable, he actually took the time to talk and ask questions, also he showed that he really was concerned about my problem. Then to top it off, the day after he called me to check on me, what Dr does that !!!!!! I would definitely recommend him to anyone with a problem. I will continue to go to him for help. If I could give him 10 stars I would.
1 Made an appointment as a new patient. Arrived 10 minutes early to fill out paperwork. Filled out name on clip board at front desk. Was not given any paperwork. Called up 10 minutes later to give insurance card, still not given any paperwork. Called up another 10 minutes later to fill out paperwork. 3 minutes later went to turn in paperwork but no one to be found. Stood at window like an idiot for 10 more minutes waiting for anyone to come back to get paperwork. Smelled food thru window. Wondered if they left for lunch break. Finally woman comes back and takes paperwork. Called back to window 10 minutes later to make co-payment. Asked how much longer. Told very soon with no apology or care in the world. Sat down for another 10 minutes. Wondered when Ashton Kutcher is going to bust in and tell me I've been punked. Went to tell woman I am leaving. Once again, no woman at desk. Total ghost town. Wondered if I am in the middle of a bad dream. Shook head and walked out. No call from office to even see what happened.   Must not have been the first person to get fed up with waiting at this place. Lost $15 copay and 55 minutes of my own lunch time. Will never come back or recommend this Dr or his office. Horrible staff usually means horrible Dr. Will dispute copay on credit card statement. I feel sorry for the other chumps still sitting in the waiting room. Wondered how long they have been coming here putting up with this nonsense. You do realize there is a Dr's office on almost every corner?
5 Class act. Really happy with these guys after my third visit; they're really helping keep this #dadbod in shape.
1 I came to Doctor Burroff per recommendation of my family. He was rude to me and didn't listen to my concerns. Instead of suggesting tests as he politely did for my husband, he asked me that if something is making me feel so bad, why do I keep doing it? I also came in for an evaluation after being admitted to the ER for an anxiety attack. He continued to insult me and pester me to explain to him why I was having anxiety. It left me in tears and only when I started to cry did he try to show some compassion. I'm glad he seems like a good guy to the rest of my family, but I will never go to his practice EVER again! Plus, I would spend hours waiting to be seen, which is ridiculous. Only positive thing I have to say is that the rest of the staff was super nice.
5 Been a year since I had to go here, but I was there for quite some time. They refused to give up on me.  I don't have a sob story -no accident that I needed to rehabilitate from. Just a messed up back and neck from sitting at the computer too much (I know, cry me a river, right?)  Amazing workouts, and they would actually give short massages afterward to work on the really knotted up spots.  They also had a 10s unit - my absolute favorite part of the whole process.  Nothing like vibrating the knots out of your back!  I could've laid there the whole time and just did that.  They use pilates equipment too, which was interesting and very useful.  The staff knew what they were doing, and were totally friendly as well.  We'd goof off a bit too and just chat.  It was friendly and nice.  When they sent me packing b/c I'd improved quite a bit, they sent me on my way with information on how to continue my exercises to avoid future problems.
5 Bis jetzt war ich nur bei einer Sitzung bei Corpusmed. Der Eindruck bisher ist klasse, man geht genau auf die Bedürfnisse ein, kümmert sich um den Patienten! Ich merke schon deutliche Verbesserungen ggü. vorher. Die sechs Sitzungen wurden auch gleich zeitnah geplant! Bin auch die nächsten Sitzungen gespannt!
4 I recommend them. It took a little bit on time to see me but I was in and out with in an hour. They where very nice and double checked it I had any questions. They do electronic prescription, which was very handy by the time I got to my cvs I walked up and picked it up with no problem and in a matter of time.
5 Great quality service.  I've been to 3 other physical therapy offices and Swing is by far the best. The PT is with you for excercises and for working hands on with your problem area.  The other offices I tried were 45 minutes with an "assistant" and only 5 minutes with an actual PT.  Highly recommend.
1 Dr. Raia seemed like my husband was wasting his time.  Looked at his  wrist and said it was sprained even though his pain hadn't got any better in two months.  Said he could give him a shot.  He came in with a needle and syringe and injected his wrist without prepping it with alcohol.  Then he turned and  walked out.  It was disappointing.
1 I phoned to try to get a new patient appointment and was told they had zero availability until the 3rd week of August (which is 5 weeks away). When I inquired of whether this is only for new patients or if they block out same day appointments for current patients should there be an emergency or illness- the receptionist was curt and extremely rude saying "well didn't YOU SAY your husband was new?!"    If they are this rude to someone seeking a primary care physician and calls them for the first time- I can't imagine how they to their patients. No thank you. I should have read the reviews first but thought since it was a privately owned practice that they would be more personable. Wrong.
5 It's sad that car accidents are an industry in Vegas due to all the bad and negligent drivers out there. Alas, if you find yourself christened as a Vegas local and in a a car accident, you need to get yourself situated. Billboards of lawyers, tons of chiropractors, insurance companies confusing you - it's hard to know who to trust.   After I was involved in a car accident, urgent care said they could not see me and had to refer me out. They had a list of "Core Rehab" facilities they recommended - Southern NV Chiropractic being one of them. I was hesitant to go to anyone, but then my husband's colleague also recommended this office as a trustworthy place. Scheduling a same-day appointment was easy. Dr. Reiss isn't practicing as much as he used to (although I was adjusted by him once, he was great!), so Dr. Perl was taking care of me. Dr. Perl was personable and a professional at all times. She took time to get to know me on a personal level, as did her wonderful staff, and I truly felt taken care of. My regular adjustments really helped me get back into feeling like my normal self post-accident. Billing and handling the insurance claim was also easy and painless after my treatments concluded. Their facility is much cleaner and equipment much newer compared to other offices I have been to. The office staff is very friendly and patient, especially with the kids who just won't sit still. Please do them a favor and keep your own kids in check during your visits, they aren't babysitters.   Thanks Southern Nevada Chiropractic for taking such good care of me!
2 Friendly staff so far, but my appointment was at 12:30 and I'm sitting in the exam room and haven't been seen yet. It's 2:05. Not a good sign. This is my first time here. I lost excellent insurance due to a layoff, so this is my first experience of what crap insurance gets you. The upside is that you can watch the Property Brothers all day long. They have TV monitors in the lobby and exam rooms.
5 Awesome Dr very understanding  and thorough explains everything and takes her time with her patients...staff is very friendly ..goes by appointment , never a wait. clean office helps with talking about issues She is wonderful wish I could have her as my doctor
3 First off I want to state the Doctors here are great and I have always had great service with the staff, but not today... I have normally never had a problem with this place and have always been taken care of and I would like to just state that Arial at the front desk needs an attitude adjustment. Requested for medical records to be mailed to them... 11/6/14.... You have to keep calling to see if they have been received because they can't call you to let you know and here I am a month later still they say they never received them so I request for them to fax the paperwork. Fax number on the website (the main website) should be right don't you think? I call back and tell Arial that a fax should be coming she asked where I sent it and I gave her the fax from their website and she argued with me. All I was stating is that the website is wrong and she says "I don't care what the website says it is not our fax number" really??? She could have handled that completely different. If you don't want to deal with people or give them compassion you shouldn't be in health care. If it wasn't so hard to find a good doctor in this town I would not be using this office. Doctors are great customer service is horrible.
5 Great help for my nephew
1 These people don't practice good medicine and they talk down to patients. They pass judgment on your needs and don't actually help you. At least that's the experience I've had with their latest PA's and NP's. Save your time and money and go elsewhere.
5 Great staff!!! Very professional, personable and always on top of things. They care about you and your health...the girls in the office are ThE Best!!!
1 I was seen at this practice for a few years. The reason I left was because I was tired of having to argue with the person who does the referrals for her to do her job! My insurance is very difficult and needs the referrals done a certain way in order for my insurance to pay. Well, anytime I needed a referral this woman would try to get out of doing her job and would tell me incorrect information which would have ended up costing me money if I would have listened to her. After leaving this practice I now get better, thorough care and have never had to argue with staff about my referrals. I should have read up on this practice because they have bad reviews on other sites as well due to bad staff.
5 Crystal Taylor is amazing!!! This facility is a Jewel among all the others Everytime I've came here and Crystal Taylor is here I know Im going to leave feeling better she is very knowledgeable and professional. Thank you CareNow  for Having Her.
1 Dr Hamilton is a Greedy Dr, I needed some forms filled out for Aenta long term, short term disability ins thru my work, call the office of Dr Hamilton and they said I could drop them off, went there this morning, and I refused to do unless I made an appt. I just was there last month for my yearly physical had all my tests, and he said I needed to make an appt, this form was a simple yes, or no with basic medical info needed, Dr Hamilton refused to see me today, said I had to make an appt for next week after the holiday , he has moved over to the Scottsdale, McDowell  mountain ranch area, far from were I live ,huge I inconvenient drive. He just wanted to charge me a co pay so he could bill my medical ins for a bogus dr appt. last month when I saw him for my physical, he was in the room 5 min, his assistants did all the rest. My physical that he billed my ins was over 1200 dollars!!!! Simple blood, work and a thyroid panel was all he did.i would never recommend anybody I know going to such a greedy ,lazy dr.
1 Wait times are up to 3 hours but they will get you in for emergencies. The waiting room is comfortable and the staff pleasant. They have x-ray on site and several locations which is nice. My complaint besides the wait times is the inability to reach the appropriate party you need to assist you even if that person is already in the middle of working on, completing or has completed your request you will hold just to get someone answering the telephone who will not properly assist you and handle your call appropriately. This is a time consuming and frustrating medical practice to say the least.
1 I was just referred here by my Orthopedic MD for specialized care and to get Ultrasound. Can I say from the reviews I have read, I have experienced the same issues. It took over 7 calls to even get a call back & then they had not checked for my Paperwork. I have been on the phone with my Orthopedic MD & their office for two days. They don't answer their phones or you get an answering service.. I am very very hesitant to even start with this practice, regardless how good the MD's are a treating one. This is unacceptable for patients in pain having to experience this. I am sorry, I don't usually say bad things, but I am pretty upset before I even start. Going further, how does one even set up appointments if you can't get a real person to answer the phone...
